  asked questions</font></b></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Citizen's Income 
  is an unconditional and nonwithdrawable income paid to every individual as a 
  right of citizenship. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It could be paid 
  for by reducing tax allowances and means-tested and contributory benefits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="4"><a name="WhatisaCI"></a>What 
  is a Citizen's Income?</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1. How is Citizen's 
  Income defined?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Citizen's Income 
  is an income paid by the state to every man, woman and child as a right of citizenship. 
  The assessment unit is the individual, and so the amount of Citizen's Income 
  received is the same whether one is living alone, or as a partner of a couple, 
  or as a member of a family or household. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2. Would there 
  be any conditions attached to receiving it?</b><br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes, one. Recipients 
  would have to establish their right to legal residence in this country.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>3. Would everyone 
  get the same amount?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No, the Citizen's 
  Income may be age related. More would be offered to elderly people than to adults 
  of working age; and usually more for adults than children. There would also 
  be supplements for those with disabilities. But there would be no differences 
  in the amount of the Citizen's Income on account of income or wealth, work status, 
  willing-to-work tests, race, religious affiliation, gender, sexual preference, 
  marital status or household association.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>4. How much 
  would the Citizen's Income be?</b><br>
  <br>
  A FULL Citizen's Income (FCI) is defined as 'enough to live on'. If everyone 
  were to receive a FCI, it would cost so much to pay for it that it is unlikely 
  to gain political or public support. However, some people, such as elderly people, 
  could be granted a FCI.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A PARTIAL Citizen's 
  Income (PCI) is one that is not sufficient to live on by itself, and it would 
  need to be topped up by earnings. However, those without any other income, or 
  whose other income is insufficient to live on, would need their incomes to be 
  supplemented from public resources via residual contributory and means-tested 
  benefits. The Citizen's Income Trust has costed schemes based on a Citizen's 
  Income equal to the current amount of Pension Credit for those aged 65 or over, 
  and on the current levels of Income Support or Job Seekers Allowance for adults. 
  For some households, this Partial Citizen's Income would need to be supplemented 
  by other provision, especially for housing costs, but far fewer people would 
  need such supplements than need current means-tested benefits. With a Citizen's 
  Income the marginal deduction rate (the amount of any extra &pound;1 of earnings 
  lost through taxation and benefits withdrawal) would be a lot less than under 
  the current system, it would be far easier for households to increase their 
  net income and therefore to earn their way out of poverty.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>5. Would the 
  payments be taxable?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No, the Citizen's 
  Income would be exempt from income tax (though it is not intrinsic to a Citizen's 
  Income that this should be so).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>6. How would 
  Citizen's Income be paid for?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This could be done 
  in different ways. One possibility would be through a new Income Tax that would 
  combine existing Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions. In principle, 
  all income other than the Citizen's Income payment would be taxable. The present 
  system of Income Tax allowances and reliefs benefits those on higher incomes 
  more than the less well off. With a Citizen's Income, everyone would receive 
  the same Citizen's Income payment. The outcome of this change would be people 
  in the highest earnings groups contributing a little more Income Tax than under 
  our present system. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>7. Do we have 
  anything like a Citizen's Income already? </b><br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes. Child Benefit, 
  paid on behalf of every child regardless of the income or work status of the 
  parents, is a Citizen's Income for children. A comprehensive CI could be administered 
  in the same way as Child Benefit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  <font size="4"><b><a name="Whyreplace"></a>Why do we need to replace the present 
  benefit and tax systems?<br>
  </b></font><b> </b> </font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. What's wrong 
  with the present system?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Existing benefits 
  fail to do the job for which they were originally intended. The </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">basic 
  principles of the Beveridge Report are as relevant today as they were then. 
  They were:<br>
  </font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The right of 
    every citizen to a minimum level of subsistence; <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The need to 
    preserve incentive, opportunity and responsibility.<br>
    </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, both society 
  and the economy are very different today compared with the post-war conditions 
  in which much of the Beveridge Report was implemented. The National Insurance 
  system, which offered benefits for Maternity, Invalidity, Sickness, Unemployment 
  and Retirement (MISUR), was based on the assumption that there would be full 
  employment, and that wages for men would be sufficient to maintain a wife at 
  home raising children. Now there are many more diverse family structures, there 
  are more women in paid employment, and people are living longer. There is widespread 
  unemployment and employment patterns have changed. Information technology is 
  ensuring that fewer employees produce more goods, and the new jobs that have 
  been created are often low paid, temporary and insecure. People are frequently 
  forced to switch between the labour market and dependency on benefits, and mid-life 
  retraining is often necessary. Most people, even those in well-paid occupations, 
  are often no more than two or three months away from the disaster of losing 
  a job, a home, and even a family. Debt and financial insecurity are features 
  of our affluent society. <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over time, the 
  levels of National Insurance (NI) benefits have not been maintained at a level 
  sufficient to meet the needs for which they were designed. A social assistance 
  'safety net' of means-tested benefits (MTBs) was set up, initially for those 
  who were not eligible for NI benefits, but now it takes in all those for whom 
  NI benefits are inadequate. The system has deteriorated into a constantly changing, 
  complicated morass. <br>
  The joint application for benefits required of all couples means that financially 
  dependent partners have no privacy, no autonomy, and, in some cases, no income. 
  While this has for a long time affected women with child-rearing responsibilities, 
  or looking after elderly relatives, in recent years it has also affected unemployed 
  men with working wives. Another problem arises because the amount of benefit 
  to which one is eligible depends on a range of circumstances, some of which 
  can vary frequently. Administration costs alone put nearly 2 pence on the rate 
  of income tax. Despite a promise in 1997 to raise 4 million children out of 
  poverty by 2020, intermediate goals for 2005 and 2010 have not been met. There 
  has been a decline in the number of children in poverty, but now the improvement 
  has stalled because the initial improvement was bought at the cost of households 
  higher up the earned income scale experiencing high marginal deduction rates. 
  The levels of MTBs are often below the government's own poverty benchmarks. 
  <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Where the MTB system 
  overlaps with the income tax system in the same range of income, it produces 
  many perverse, counter-productive and inefficient results. As earned income 
  rises, tax has to be paid and means-tested benefits are withdrawn, and many 
  households suffer marginal deduction rates of 95%. This means that, for every 
  extra &pound;1 earned, the household keeps only 5p. The overlap provides an 
  inbuilt disincentive for benefit recipients to increase their earned income. 
  There is evidence of 'in-work-poverty' experienced by working people, in spite 
  of the introduction of a national minimum wage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eligibility for 
  most current benefits depends on work status. Claimants must be out of work 
  but available for work, or out of work and unable to work. Lower-paid people, 
  especially families with children, can claim tax credits. Otherwise, with the 
  notable exceptions of Retirement Pensions and Child Benefit, working and at 
  the same time claiming many kinds of benefit is a criminal offence. It is possible 
  for people on Job Seeker's Allowance to study, train, and do voluntary work, 
  but the system imposes significant constraints on the kinds and extents of such 
  activities.<br>
  Even if they can claim Tax Credits, the unemployed can still find it difficult 
  to find a job that pays more than Job Seeker's Allowance PLUS Income Tax, National 
  Insurance contributions, increased Council Tax, travel expenses, and childcare 
  costs. This is the unemployment trap.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are three 
  similar traps:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE UNEMPLOYMENT 
  TRAP: This is defined as a situation in which someone can be worse off financially 
  when working than when on benefits. The unemployment trap is not as deep as 
  it was fifteen years ago. There is now a national minimum wage, and Tax Credits 
  have boosted the income of many households that previously would have suffered 
  poverty. The problem is now more administrative. People are understandably reluctant 
  to take employment that might not last long, because their Job Seeker's Allowance 
  (JSA), or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), will be lost. Tax Credits 
  have to be claimed (a complex process), and if the job doesn't last then JSA 
  or ESA has to be claimed afresh. Tax Credit overpayments are all too common, 
  plunging poor families into unrelenting debt. Part-time employment, which for 
  many could be the first step out of unemployment, is now particularly difficult 
  to seek and accept because of the Income Tax, Tax Credit and benefits complexities 
  that are involved. For many households, accepting part-time employment of less 
  than 16 hours per week provides almost no financial gain. Whilst there have 
  been improvements in the availability of childcare, fares to work and the costs 
  of childcare continue to pose additional problems to those whose income in employment 
  remains only marginally above income out of employment, and this is particularly 
  a problem in relation to lone parents seeking part time employment. In some 
  ways, the most serious problem is the criminalisation of people who take part 
  time employment of a few hours per week whilst remaining on JSA or ESA. <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE POVERTY TRAP. 
  Working families with children can claim means-tested Tax Credits, but this 
  replaces the unemployment trap with the poverty trap. By the time they have 
  paid their taxes and lost benefits, some families keep only a few pence out 
  of each extra &pound;1 earned. This makes it very difficult for claimants to 
  work their way out of poverty. Not only is this a disincentive to seek higher 
  paid employment: it also discourages people from seeking qualifications that 
  might lead to higher paid employment. <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">THE SAVINGS TRAP. 
  Many pensioners (mostly women) are still not entitled to a full Basic State 
  Pension, because they have not been in full-time work for long enough, if at 
  all: often because they were looking after others. Instead, they are expected 
  to claim Means-Tested Benefits. Other pensioners, who have worked and saved 
  all their lives, find themselves little better off than if they had not saved 
  at all. Whilst their position has improved slightly recently they can still 
  find that their savings or their small occupational or private pensions reduce 
  considerably the amounts of means-tested Pensions Credit that they receive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We need a tax and 
  benefits system that matches the changing needs of society in the 2lst century.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2. So how would 
  a Citizen's Income change things?</b><br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citizen's Income 
  has the same objectives as the Beveridge Report, but it uses different and potentially 
  much more effective methods to achieve them. Contribution records, means testing 
  and income tax allowances would be dispensed with, and a Citizen's Income would 
  be introduced, based on legal residence. Out would go all 'dependency additions' 
  (for spouses and children) and in would come automatic Citizen's Income payments 
  for each man, woman and child. Out would go threats of losing benefits, and 
  in would come an economic incentive to seek employment and new skills, and also 
  the freedom to take whatever jobs are available without fear of prosecution.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Citizen's Income 
  tackles the unemployment trap by removing the link between benefits and work 
  status. Unemployed people, those receiving Incapacity Benefit, lone mothers 
  - anyone entering or re-entering the labour market - would keep their CIs. Students 
  and trainees would have a secure income. A Citizen's Income would increase, 
  not impair, economic efficiency.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b><a name="Howpay"></a>What 
  would a Citizen's Income scheme involve and how would we pay for it?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1. How much 
  would the Citizen's Income be?</b><br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Citizen's Income 
  Trust has ruled out the possibility of a Full CI for everyone as being far too 
  expensive.The Trust has researched a modest Partial Citizen's Income scheme 
  based on the current level of Pension Credit as the level of the Citizen's Income 
  for adults aged 65 and over, the current levels of Jobseeker's Allowance as 
  the level for a Citizen's Income for adults aged 25-64 and for young adults 
  aged 18-24, and the current level of Jobseeker's Allowance for young people 
  aged 16-17 as the level of Citizen's Income for children up to the age of 17. 
  It has found such a scheme to be economically feasible. Whilst these are not 
  large amounts, they would produce transfers of income to the poorest sections 
  of our community, because take-up would be virtually 100 per cent and non-earning 
  carers (including many mothers) would receive a secure cash income of their 
  own for the first time. If this scheme were a success then increases would be 
  possible. Slowly but surely, Beveridge's idea of a safety net that can be relied 
  on, but which does not stifle initiative and incentives, would become a reality. 
  This simple Citizen's Income scheme is illustrated in the Table below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2. Would a Citizen's 
  Income promote employment?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> With a Citizen's 
  Income, part-time work, flexible working, temporary contracts and self-employment 
  would become more attractive. <br>

  than it is under the current system.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/Graph%2c%20CI%20and%20employment.png" width="464" height="240"></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  The present pattern of employment opportunities is too rigid and inflexible, 
  particularly for disadvantaged groups such as people with disabilities and single 
  parents with small children. It is also unsuitable for increasing numbers of 
  older workers who might prefer some form of part-time working in the transition 
  from full-time employment to retirement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By helping to break 
  down the barriers between employment and unemployment, a Citizen's Income would 
  enable workers to develop more flexible patterns of work that would be more 
  consistent with their own needs. It would also give some reward to those whose 
  voluntary caring contribution to society is so important, but currently unrecognised.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>3. How else 
  would a Citizen's Income help the economy?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It would ensure 
  that those seeking higher education, training or re-training would be able to 
  take advantage of a small secure income. Today, some people get grants, loans 
  or training allowances but there is no income guarantee. It is hardly surprising 
  that in these circumstances British industry suffers from a severe and chronic 
  skills shortage. At present, students and trainees depend almost entirely on 
  a hit-and-miss system that obscures a long-term view of the country's industrial 
  needs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because a Citizen's 
  Income would replace tax allowances, the tax base would broaden. Earnings have 
  no effect on a Citizen's Income, whereas for means-tested benefits and Tax Credits 
  earnings reduce benefit levels and so have to be declared. With a Citizen's 
  Income there would therefore be less incentive than at present to avoid declaring 
  earnings, and so more earnings would be declared for tax purposes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Citizen's Income 
  described above would redistribute net income slightly from higher earners to 
  lower earners:</font></p>

  of the Citizen's Income scheme. Next could come a Citizen's Pension for people

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rather than a Citizen's 
  Income enabling employers to pay lower wages, it would enable people to move 
  more easily from one job to another. At the same time, it would provide an incentive 
  for people to take jobs at higher pay levels, because it would overcome the 
  worst effects of the unemployment and poverty traps. A Citizen's Income would 
  therefore make it generally easier for people to move from one job to another 
  and employers would have to pay realistic wages in order to retain their staff. 
  The labour market would also lose some of its current rigidities and would be 
  closer to a classical market, thus improving the efficiency of the labour market 
  at the same time as improving people's ability to increase their earned income.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>6. Wouldn't 
  a Citizen's Income decrease incentives to work?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some people believe 
  that, without an availability-for-work test, a benefit such as Citizen's Income 
  would destroy the work ethic. Paradoxically it is the present system that decreases 
  the incentives to work, train, care for others etc. by paying benefits to people 
  only so long as they do nothing, and by penalising and often criminalising them 
  when they try to help themselves. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>7. How would 
  the Citizen's Income be paid for?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are a number 
  of ways:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">by reducing 
    expenditure on current benefits and tax credits</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">by savings on 
    administration</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">by raising extra 
    revenue by abolishing income tax allowances and reliefs</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">from the results 
    of increased wealth creation through greater economic efficiency</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">by establishing 
    such green taxes as a tax on carbon</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Expenditure savings 
  would arise because the CI payments would replace most existing benefits, and 
  they would be a far less costly system to administer than the existing tax and 
  benefits system. The Exchequer would get more revenue, a) because the Income 
  Tax base would be wider, and b) because employees' and self-employed people's 
  National Insurance contributions could be integrated into the new style Income 
  Tax, and c) because fewer people would be caught in the poverty and unemployment 
  traps and more people would be able to contribute through their earnings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>8. Is Income 
  Tax the only means by which a Citizen's Income could be financed?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There may be other 
  ways as well. In Alaska every citizen receives an annual income from the profits 
  of oil produced at Prudhoe Bay. In the UK we might look at the idea of a 'social 
  dividend' financed out of the profits of industry as it adopts new technologies, 
  or possibly a carbon tax or a financial transactions tax. But for the time being 
  an integrated income tax would be the easiest method to implement. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
  <font size="4"><b><a name="Affordable"></a>Is a Citizen's Income affordable?</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A feasible, introductory 
  Citizen's Income scheme is outlined here, based on modest levels of partial 
  CI for working age people. It is intended to be revenue and cost neutral. For 
  simplicity, we shall assume a flat rate of tax on earned income of 31% (20% 
  income tax plus 11% employee's National Insurance contributions), with a higher 
  rate as at present on higher earnings. Rates of 20% are assumed for pensioners 
  and of 20% for unearned income. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(1) These are in 
  addition to the Tax Credits treated as benefit payments.<br>
  (2) Table 1.5 shows &pound;19,700m as the net cost, i.e. the cost of tax relief 
  (at up to 40%) minus tax paid on pensions in payment (largely at 20%). If tax 
  relief for pensions contributions is restricted to 20%, the net long-run cost 
  will be minimal.<br>
  (3) Under a Citizen's Income scheme, National Insurance will be merged into 
  the overall tax rate and all benefits will be non-contributory, so there will 
  be no additional National Insurance rebates or reliefs.<br>
  (4) These are regressive subsidies. A higher rate taxpayer benefits twice as 
  much as a basic rate taxpayer and benefit claimants lose benefits if they have 
  significant savings.<br>

  <font size="4"><b><a name="History"></a>The history of Citizen's Income</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1. Where and 
  when did the idea of Citizen's Income come from?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thomas Paine recommended 
  that every citizen should receive an income from the state, in compensation 
  for the inequitable division of land, which he regarded as belonging to every 
  citizen. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1920, Major 
  C.H. Douglas proposed Social Credit or National Dividend as a remedy for the 
  effect of unemployment. Variations of this idea entered the economic and social 
  policy debates of the inter-war period and were advocated by several leading 
  economists associated with John Maynard Keynes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sir William Beveridge's 
  Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services of 1942, and the subsequent legislation 
  for the welfare state as we know it, included a provision for family allowances: 
  an allowance for every child except the first in each family. (Child Benefit 
  later extended the benefit to all children). Beveridge's system comprised a 
  contributory insurance scheme backed up by a social assistance 'safety net' 
  of lower means-tested benefits. However, the insurance benefits were not maintained 
  at a realistic level over time, and eventually the now more 'generous' means-tested 
  'safety net' benefits, which included housing costs, were used to top up the 
  contributory benefits. The stage was therefore set for ideas aimed at reform, 
  and the example of Child Benefit offered a possible way forwards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>2. How did the 
  Citizen's Income idea enter the mainstream welfare debate?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All through his 
  career the late Professor James Meade of Cambridge University (winner of the 
  Nobel prize for Economics in 1977) advocated the introduction of what we now 
  call a Citizen's Income. In Britain, during the 1930s, he advocated what he 
  called a Social or National Dividend that would be payable to all citizens. 
  But the modern debate about an income paid to individuals and replacing existing 
  cash benefits and income tax reliefs is generally dated to the 'New Social Contract' 
  advocated in 1943 by Lady Juliet Rhys Williams as an alternative to the Beveridge 
  Report. Her 'contract' was close to a Citizen's Income but differed from it 
  in that the receipt of benefit depended on a work test. Professor Meade later 
  developed Lady Rhys Williams' ideas, abandoning her work test, and financing 
  the scheme through income tax. He was particularly concerned to see Citizen's 
  Income as a method of helping a return to full employment. He argued that a 
  Citizen's Income served three purposes: '(1) It relieves poverty by guaranteeing 
  for every citizen a sufficient Minimum Acceptable Level of income. (2) It does 
  so without destroying incentives to work if it is not withdrawn as the citizen 
  earns other income. (3) It provides a universal supplement to earnings which 
  is aimed at justifying any restriction of rates of pay which is needed to ensure 
  full employment.' A few months before his death in December 1995, Meade had 
  once again returned to this theme in his book Full Employment Regained? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citizen's Income 
  is also the logical conclusion to Richard Titmuss' famous 1955 lecture in which 
  he drew attention to similarities and inequities between social security benefits, 
  tax reliefs and occupational benefits. In 1962 in their book Capitalism and 
  Freedom Milton and Rose Friedman proposed a negative income tax as a way of 
  escaping work-status benefits. But their negative income tax is not the same 
  as a CI, because their assessment unit is the family or household rather than 
  the individual, and the amounts payable depend on the total income of all the 
  family members. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>3. Have British 
  Governments thought of introducing basic income schemes?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1972 the Conservative 
  Government of Edward Heath put forward detailed proposals for a tax credit scheme. 
  It would have replaced most income tax allowances and some social security benefits 
  with tax credits payable in cash where they exceeded tax liability. These tax 
  credits resembled a Citizen's Income in some ways but did not cover the whole 
  of the population, excluding those on low incomes, (less than &pound;8 per week 
  in 1972). Child Benefit, which is a Citizen's Income for children in all but 
  name, was phased in between 1977 and 1979, replacing taxable family allowances 
  and child tax allowances.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>4. Are the political 
  parties interested in the idea?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Politicians from 
  all the major parties have shown interest in the concept of CI. The Liberal 
  Party accepted it as official policy during the 1980s, but, as Liberal Democrats, 
  the party has since modified its support. CI remains official policy of The 
  Green Party. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by the late John Smith 
  (Labour Party leader), said that it would be 'unwise' to rule out a CI for the 
  future. A recent survey of opinion in the House of Commons and the House of 
  Lords discovered considerable support for a Royal Commission on income maintenance, 
  and for a Citizen's Income to be one of the options considered for the reform 
  of the tax and benefit system.<br>
  <br>
  <b>5. Have any academic institutions shown interest in researching the scheme?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Yes. A CI has a 
  great deal of support in the academic world where much work is being done to 
  assess the impact of a CI on our social and industrial life and its costs and 
  benefits. The academic literature on the subject is now massive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>6. Has the idea 
  spread abroad?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In The Netherlands 
  the Dutch were discussing 'Basisinkommen' in the late l970s. In Belgium, France 
  and Germany the debate is mainly restricted to academic institutions. In Canada 
  in 1985 the MacDonald Commission recommended a Universal Income Security Program 
  with a low guaranteed income level, a low tax-back rate, and special 'top-ups' 
  for those who are unable to work. Alaska already has an annual dividend payment 
  paid equally to all citizens financed out of its oil revenues. New Zealand and 
  some other countries have Citizen's Pensions. And a recent Citizen's Income 
  pilot project in Namibia has produced some very positive results.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>7. What is the 
  future for the idea?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An increasingly 
  globalised world is putting pressure on earned incomes and is going to require 
  more flexible labour markets. The normal working life is now a series of employments, 
  often held concurrently, of varying numbers of hours per week. Movement in and 
  out of employment is now frequent for many people. Households are more diverse, 
  and they experience more frequent changes, in structure. In this situation, 
  the rigid tax and benefits system that we have inherited serves neither our 
  society nor our economy. A Citizen's Income is the sort of long-term solution 
  that we should now seriously consider. It combines the possibility of increasing 
  economic efficiency with a secure income that would allow maximum freedom to 
  the individual. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>1. What is the 
  Citizen's Income Trust?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The charitable 
  trust, the Citizen's Income Trust, takes its name from the concept of a universal 
  or basic income guaranteed to all citizens who are legal residents of this country. 
  The organisation used to be called the Basic Income Research Group, which was 
  formed in 1984 under the auspices of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations 
  (NCVO), to research all aspects of reform along the lines of a Basic Income. 
  The association with NCVO continued until 1987, when BIRG became independent. 
  In 1989, BIRG became a registered charity (no. 328198) and in 1992, BIRG changed 
  its name to the Citizen's Income Trust because social security reform is an 
  important part of the wider debate about the nature of citizenship.</font></p>
