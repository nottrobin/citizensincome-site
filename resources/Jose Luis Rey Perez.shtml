                      Is it possible to argue for a human right to basic income? 
                      For that purpose we have to look for good fundamentals for 
                      this new right. Here I will examine the connections between 
                      basic income and two concepts of basic needs as a way to 
                      support a human right to basic income. These two concepts 
                      of needs are moral concepts. Firstly, I will study the connection 
                      between basic income and primary needs. Secondly, the connection 
                      between basic income and radical needs. At the end we can 
                      conclude that basic income is not itself a right. It is 
                      a guarantee (a good guarantee, and perhaps the best one) 
                      to the right to subsistence and to the right to develop 
                      different lifestyles. </font></p>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
                      all we know basic income is a income paid by the government 
                      to each adult member of the society irrespective of whether 
                      the person is rich or poor, lives alone or with others, 
                      is willing to work or not; in addition, basic income is 
                      granted not only to citizens but also to all permanent residents 
                      (Van Parijs, 1992; 1995; 2001, among others). This is the 
                      definition of the so-called basic income, which is supported 
                      by Professor Van Parijs in his book Real freedom for all. 
                      <br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      idea is, in one side, very attractive. But, in the other 
                      side, it is surprising. It is attractive because consists 
                      on a radical reform of the assistance systems that we know 
                      in the Welfare State. This assistance was always conditioned 
                      to fulfil a lot of requirements; it was not universal. But 
                      it is also surprising in a current context of economical 
                      crisis and control of the budget. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
                      we look for the origin of the proposal we find that it was 
                      born in the context of a Marxist discussion. In the article 
                      &quot;A capitalist road to communism&quot;, Van Parijs and 
                      Van der Veen (Van der Veen and Van Parijs, 1986) upheld 
                      that a universal and unconditioned basic income was a good 
                      way to arrive to communism without passing through socialism. 
                      The purpose of socialism consists on the elimination of 
                      the exploitation, but the purpose of communism is to eliminate 
                      the alienation. If the government provides with an income 
                      (which quantity must be enough to cover basic needs) to 
                      everybody, then people are free to work or not to work. 
                      If they decide to work it would be because other reason 
                      different from the necessity to eat every day. Or, in other 
                      words, people would not be alienated. This proposal received 
                      a lot of critics and a lot of supports too, and was the 
                      seed of an interesting political debate. </font></p>

                      Look for fundamentals</font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
                      the end of communism compelled Van Parijs to look for another 
                      support to basic income. In fact, I think there are two 
                      ways for argue in favour of the basic income. In one side, 
                      there are those arguments that connect basic income with 
                      a theory of Justice. In the other side, there are those 
                      arguments that compare the basic income with other type 
                      of programs; the criterion in this case is the economical 
                      efficiency. But if we want to argue basic income as a fundamental 
                      right we have to follow the first way. The decision about 
                      if we are in front of a new human right doesn't depend on 
                      economical efficiency. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      <i>Real freedom for all</i> (Van Parijs, 1995) he tries 
                      to demonstrate the necessity of a basic income for what 
                      he calls a fair society. As we know, Van Parijs thinks that 
                      we are in a fair State only if the real freedom is protected. 
                      Real freedom is the freedom of people to do anything a person 
                      may want to do, not only what now he wants to do but also 
                      what they might want to do. The theory of Justice argued 
                      by Van Parijs is a liberal theory. The government can't 
                      promote any idea about what is the good life. The State 
                      is justified only if it defends the real freedom of the 
                      citizens. With this purpose, there are three principles 
                      that order the society: the security, the ownership of oneself 
                      and the order of opportunities in favour of people with 
                      disadvantages. These principles go with their own institutions. 
                      The security raises a body of guaranteed rights. The ownership 
                      of oneself origins the right to own autonomy. And the third 
                      principle generates the basic income. In fact, a society 
                      without this new institution is radically liberal, but not 
                      egalitarian liberal. Only if the State provides with a universal 
                      basic income we can argue that we are in a society which 
                      members are really free. <br>
                      From my point of view, Van Parijs proves that basic income 
                      is enough to protect real freedom of citizens, but he can't 
                      prove that the basic income is necessary to this purpose. 
                      If we try to argue for a new human right we must prove that 
                      it is necessary. If we argue about sufficiency we have to 
                      compare the different options from the economical efficiency 
                      analysis. But if we talk about human rights we have to demonstrate 
                      that they are necessary to Justice. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      this point I would like to investigate another way to argue 
                      basic income as a human right. This is the relationship 
                      between basic needs and basic income. Basic needs are the 
                      anthropological support for human rights, so this is a good 
                      way to look for the fundamentals for a right to basic income. 
                      In his first articles about basic income Van Parijs said 
                      that it must be enough to cover basic needs (Van der Veen 
                      and Van Parijs, 1986). But in <i>Real freedom for all</i> 
                      (Van Parijs, 1995) he says that there is nothing in the 
                      concept of basic income that connects this institution with 
                      basic needs. Basic income can be less or more than the level 
                      of basic needs, although he recognises that the level of 
                      basic income must be &quot;sufficient for subsistence&quot; 
                      (Van Parijs, 2001; Barry, 2001). Despite, there are a lot 
                      of authors who find some connection between these two concepts. 
                      For example, the Basic Income Spanish Network defines basic 
                      income as a reasonable income but enough to cover basic 
                      needs, paid to each member of society (citizens or residents) 
                      as a right financed by taxes or by another ways (www.redrentabasica.org; 
                      Ravent&oacute;s, 2001). In this definition we can see the 
                      connection between basic needs and rights. Because one tradition 
                      of philosophy of Human Rights support the idea that social 
                      rights are ways to satisfy needs that we take away from 
                      the market. This is the reason because I think it is possible 
                      connecting basic needs and basic income, because if this 
                      is a social right there must be a link between them.</font></p>

                      Concepts of basic needs.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
                      we talk about basic needs we can mean different things. 
                      In fact, there are a lot of catalogues about what the human 
                      basic needs are. In this paper I will use only two concepts 
                      of basic needs.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Probably 
                      when we talk about basic needs immediately we think in those 
                      natural needs as eating, drinking, sleeping. These needs 
                      concern to natural world and in my opinion they don't contribute 
                      to the political discussion. But this natural concept -which 
                      belongs to the world of to be- can be reformulated in a 
                      moral concept that belongs to the world of duties. We can 
                      do this if we reformulate basic needs in accordance to the 
                      liberal moral ideal, that is, the development of moral autonomy, 
                      the development of moral agents liberty in the decisions 
                      about what they want to do in their life. Then, we can understand 
                      basic needs as the previous conditions for the moral autonomy, 
                      as those facts without them the moral election is not possible. 
                      These requirements are the same for all the agents, but 
                      they are present in different measures. If we satisfy these 
                      needs (that we can call it &quot;primary needs&quot;) all 
                      the moral agents would be in the same original point. Only 
                      from that point, we can talk about moral autonomy; only 
                      if we satisfy these needs, agents are autonomous. I think 
                      this is the concept of basic needs that support Nino (Nino, 
                      1990) and, in different sense, Doyal and Gough, although 
                      Nino doesn't offer a catalogue, and Doyal and Gough do it; 
                      however, all the needs they argue for, are conditions without 
                      them the moral autonomy doesn't exist: food and drinking 
                      water, lodging, work and environment without dangers, health, 
                      physical security, security for children, economical security 
                      and education (Doyal and Gough, 1986). <br>
                      This concept, as we can see, is wider than natural needs. 
                      Primary needs include natural ones, but also other needs 
                      as cognitive and intellectual faculties, basic education, 
                      and ownership to a moral and to a historical community. 
                      Only when we satisfy these needs we can say the agents are 
                      autonomous. <br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
                      we can understand other thing when we talk about basic needs. 
                      We can say that these needs are those ones that are originated 
                      by the moral elections of the agents. When people decide 
                      what type of life they wish, then they feel some needs; 
                      those are basic needs. Those are the radical needs that 
                      Agnes Heller (Heller, 1996) talked about. Heller thinks 
                      that all needs are real and they all must be recognised. 
                      Consequently, we cannot talk about the same needs for everybody, 
                      because needs depend on the lifestyle of each person.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obviously, 
                      there is a limit that derives from the own idea of moral 
                      autonomy. All human need must be recognised if it doesn't 
                      go against the imperative that compels to treat men and 
                      women always as an aim and not as simple instruments. Kant&acute;s 
                      imperative is the criterion to distinguish between good 
                      and bad needs, between those that must be satisfied and 
                      those that must not. As we can see, the concept of basic 
                      needs that exposes Heller is a ethical one. It is derived 
                      from the liberal idea according to it each person must decide 
                      her own lifestyle.<br>
                      In addition, the concept of radical needs is very significant 
                      to theory of human rights. If we consider that needs are 
                      the anthropological support for human rights, then, if we 
                      recognize radical needs, we are not putting in order the 
                      different groups of rights. We are not saying that the first 
                      rights that we must recognize and protect are the liberal 
                      and political ones (as some types of liberalism do) and 
                      only, in second place, the social and economical ones. If 
                      we agree with the concept of radical needs, then we think 
                      that all rights (civil, political, economical, social, cultural 
                      and other new as ecological) are in the same level and all 
                      must be satisfied. As we know, this is not the only argument 
                      to defend that social rights are, in fact, rights. There 
                      are another reasons that come from basic needs analysis 
                      (see, for example, the paper presented by Plant at last 
                      meeting of BIEN, 2002). Because the argument for primary 
                      needs involves social rights, too. But here the matter is 
                      about order. If we assume radical needs we are defending 
                      that it mustn't exist a previous order in satisfying human 
                      rights. And, in my opinion, this idea is interesting, although 
                      perhaps I think something different. <br>
                      Because, obviously, the problem of scarcity compel us to 
                      decide satisfying some rights firstly. But, as Agnes Heller 
                      writes, that order doesn't depend on the concept or on the 
                      category of rights, but the democratic consensus about which 
                      type of needs are preferred to other needs that are equally 
                      recognized (Heller, 1987; see, in this sense, Habermas, 
                      1992).<br>

                      a consequence, we have two concepts of basic needs. In one 
                      side, we can understand them as the conditions for the moral 
                      autonomy. In the other side, we can understand them as the 
                      deficiencies originated by the moral election. From my point 
                      of view, between these two concepts we can discover a logic 
                      priority. We can satisfy radical needs only when primary 
                      needs have been satisfied, because these ones make possible 
                      the moral election. Maybe Agnes Heller wouldn't agree with 
                      me, but radical needs are, in my opinion, a secondary type 
                      of needs that only appears when the conditions for moral 
                      autonomy are satisfied.</font></p>

                      Connections between basic income and basic needs. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Which 
                      connections can we discover between basic income and these 
                      two concepts of basic needs? Firstly, if we understand basic 
                      income as Van Parijs does, that is, as a institution that 
                      makes possible the real freedom, then we would choose a 
                      concept of need near to the idea of real freedom. And these 
                      are radical needs, because these are needs derived from 
                      the moral election about lifestyle. These needs are different; 
                      they depend on each man or woman's plan of life. Basic income 
                      looks a good way to satisfy radical needs. People would 
                      receive an income and they would decide the use of that 
                      money in accordance with their lifestyle. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                      idea is near to equality of welfare. The purpose is that 
                      all agents achieve the same welfare. But, as Dworkin wrote, 
                      equality of welfare depends on subjective preferences, giving 
                      more resources to people with expensive tastes and punishing 
                      the adaptative preferences (Dworkin, 1981a); 2000). Basic 
                      income solves this problems providing with the same income 
                      to everybody. <br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
                      we study the relationship between basic income and primary 
                      needs, basic income would be a income paid by the governments 
                      in order that all members of society could achieve moral 
                      autonomy. But all the moral agents have not the same needs. 
                      There are people who are more far than others from moral 
                      autonomy. And, in theory, in accordance to the idea of equality 
                      of opportunities, the State must give different quantities 
                      of resources. People who were more far from moral autonomy 
                      would receive more resources (Dworkin, 1981 b); 2000). But 
                      basic income gives the same quantity of money to everybody. 
                      For this reason I think basic income is not a institution 
                      of equality of opportunities.<br>
                      From my point of view, the basic income is in the middle 
                      of equality of opportunities and equality of welfare. The 
                      basic income has the same purpose as the equality of welfare: 
                      makes the welfare of the agents equal. And it has the same 
                      method as the equality of opportunities: it distributes 
                      resources (that, in case of basic income, is money or, as 
                      other authors defend, the resource is work or jobs). </font></p>

                      Is there a human right to basic income?<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
                      have studied the connection between these two concepts of 
                      basic needs and basic income. Now we have to investigate 
                      if we can derive from this connection a fundamental right 
                      to basic income. I talk about fundamental rights. Now it 
                      is possible that the government of a country decide to pay 
                      a basic income for the year 2004 to all citizens. But if 
                      this government decide to eliminate basic income for the 
                      year 2005, we can't object anything. But if basic income 
                      is a human right recognised, for example, in the Constitution, 
                      the government couldn't eliminate it. <br>
                      The basic needs, as a way to argue for new human rights, 
                      have been explored by many authors. In Spain, Professor 
                      Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; A&ntilde;&oacute;n has studied 
                      this deeply. She understands them as the situation of dependence 
                      that suffers a person and which is unavoidable, because 
                      the only option to avoid the damage is satisfying that need. 
                      A&ntilde;&oacute;n thinks that this unavoidable character 
                      supports the reasons to satisfy these needs. Then, deciding 
                      to satisfy a need depends on moral argumentation. We have 
                      to find good and strong arguments to justify that a need 
                      must be satisfied. But this is not enough to constitute 
                      a basic need in a right. It is necessary that we can argue 
                      that there is some obligation for somebody to satisfy that 
                      need; when we talk about rights, at the same time, we are 
                      talking about duties. For this reason, A&ntilde;&oacute;n 
                      explains that the reasons that transform needs in rights 
                      are three: firstly, there is not any alternative, present 
                      or future, to that need but its satisfaction. This must 
                      be studied from realistic positions, that is, we must do 
                      rational evaluations. Secondly, it is necessary that the 
                      moral agent who suffers the need couldn't satisfy it by 
                      herself. Lastly, it is necessary that ways of satisfactions 
                      could be articulated in effective rules (A&ntilde;&oacute;n, 
                      1994).<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following 
                      this reasoning, can we conclude that we can derive a right 
                      to basic income from its connection to basic needs? I am 
                      going to study the two relationships we are talking about. 
                      If we talk about primary needs, we are talking about a need 
                      that, if it is not satisfied, the moral agents would probably 
                      die or, at least, they couldn't be autonomous. This means 
                      that if we do not satisfy primary needs we are using people 
                      as instruments. In addition, we can articulate this needs 
                      in effective rules. In consequence, we can argue for a right 
                      to subsistence. K&uuml;nnemann talks about a right to food 
                      that it is closely connected with this, although from my 
                      point of view the object of the right to subsistence is 
                      wider; it includes not only food but also host, health and 
                      education among others (K&uuml;nnemann, 2002). And the basic 
                      income is a way to guarantee this right. The object of the 
                      right is not basic income but the subsistence. Basic income 
                      is a way among others, because we can guarantee this right 
                      with other type of institutions, with conditioned subsidies 
                      or other mechanisms. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
                      we talk about radical needs, we conclude something similar. 
                      Behind radical needs we can find the right to autonomy and 
                      dignity, in other words, the right of each person to develop 
                      his or her own lifestyle. But the object of this right is 
                      not the basic income; basic income is only a possible way 
                      to satisfy it. The object of the right is the development 
                      of different lifestyles. In this sense, Standing talks about 
                      a right to security that includes a right to income security 
                      (Standing, 2002a) and 2002b)). I think that, more or less, 
                      both are the same. The object of these rights is real freedom 
                      to develop one's lifestyle. For this reason we need income 
                      security among other things.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      this point I think it is interesting remembering the distinction 
                      between rights and guarantees that explains Professor Luigi 
                      Ferrajoli. As Italian Professor explains, the law can recognise 
                      some rights but not its guarantees (Ferrajoli, 1989; 1999; 
                      2000; 2001). I am conscious that this distinction is ambiguous. 
                      However, I think we must not confuse the object of a right 
                      with its ways of satisfaction. In fact, a right can be satisfied 
                      in different ways, and when I talk about guaranties I am 
                      talking about that, about different ways of satisfying rights. 
                      These ways are related to the different institutions through 
                      the rights are effective. For example, I don't think citizens 
                      have a right to police; better, we have a right to security. 
                      If we imagine a different institution which guarantee our 
                      security too, the right wouldn't be attack if we wouldn't 
                      have police. Only when the generalised guarantee to the 
                      right to security is police, we can say in metaphorical 
                      sense that we have &quot;a right to police&quot;; but only 
                      in metaphorical sense, because the object of the right is 
                      not the police but the security.<br>

                      this sense, Ferrajoli distinguishes between primary and 
                      secondary guarantees. The first ones are the limits, that 
                      is, the formal and substantial duties imposed to power to 
                      make real and effective the content of a right. The secondary 
                      ones, only appears when the first ones are unfulfilled and 
                      consist on the activity of judges and Courts after the infringements 
                      of rights (Ferrajoli, 1999; 2000; 2001).<br>
                      Civil and political rights have had universal guarantees. 
                      But the problem started with social, economic and cultural 
                      rights. These rights haven't got universal guarantees. In 
                      fact, their observance has depended on the political will. 
                      In this sense, the observance to these rights has been a 
                      subject of administrative law and not of human rights law.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
                      have three alternatives for guarantee social rights. First 
                      one, we can defend that social rights are not rights; they 
                      are only social politics that depend on the colour of the 
                      government (Zolo, 2001). Other solution is establishing 
                      conditional programs that depend on the grade of need. This 
                      is a no universal way to guarantee social rights and we 
                      all know that these systems have had a lot of problems. 
                      Thirdly, as Ferrajoli thinks, it is possible a universal 
                      guarantee (in the same way individual rights are guaranteed) 
                      to these rights. This guarantee would be independent from 
                      any resources test or specific situations. This guarantee 
                      is, in fact, basic income. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
                      if we consider basic income as guarantee, then we have to 
                      study it from efficiency perspective. We have to compare 
                      basic income with other possible guarantees and discover 
                      which one is better. We have to study the consequences of 
                      different social policies, as many scholars do in their 
                      researches about basic income.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      my opinion, this conclusion does not close the opportunity 
                      to include basic income in the Constitution. In fact, if 
                      we demonstrate that basic income is the best guarantee, 
                      we must include it into Constitutions. Meanwhile, talking 
                      about a right to basic income without any other arguments, 
                      it can imply taking rights not enough seriously. And today, 
                      with the events we are living, I think people who are worried 
                      about human rights, must take rights seriously, and guarantees 
                      very seriously.</font></p>
