<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this issue of 
  the <i>Citizen's Income Newsletter</i> three of the book reviews are on the 
  same theme: Taxation. We review the publications which have emerged from the 
  Mirrlees review, a collection of classic papers on taxation, and a collection 
  of conference papers. All of these volumes are essential reading for anyone 
  wishing to gain an understanding of the development of the study of the economics 
  of taxation, of the different types of tax available to a government, and of 
  some of the options for reform facing the UK tax system. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, when the 
  reviews are read together they reveal a serious gap. Whilst in the Mirrlees 
  Review publications, and in the other volumes reviewed, there is occasional 
  reference to means-tested benefits, none of them contain sustained discussions 
  of the differences between means-tested, contributory and universal benefits 
  and of the different effects of these different benefits. None of them study 
  the combined effects of the tax and benefits systems on the income maintenance 
  structure for a population. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This matters. The 
  structure of net incomes, the behaviours of their components, and those components' 
  combined effects on the many different aspects of people's lives, are arguably 
  far more important than the characteristics and effects of tax systems studied 
  alone. It is the systems working together which need to impose as little administrative 
  complexity as possible on individuals, households, employers, and governments; 
  and it is the systems working together which need to impose as few labour market, 
  savings and other disincentives as possible. Genuine tax credits would be a 
  step in the right direction (by which we don't mean the means-tested benefits 
  which the Government calls Tax Credits). Even better would be a Negative Income 
  Tax. But better than that would be a universal, nonwithdrawable and unconditional 
  benefit alongside a progressive tax system. This would be economically and administratively 
  efficient, and it would impose the fewest possible disincentives. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It would be a pleasure 
  to see this option as both the subject of a major review process and of future 
  edited collections of classic and newly written papers.</font><br>

  Benefits and a Citizen's Income</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By Anne G. Miller</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Passported benefits</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Government's 
  Social Security Advisory Committee's press release of 15 June 2011 heralded 
  a 'Public Consultation: Passported Benefits under Universal Credit - review 
  and advice.' In a footnote, the press release stated:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By Passported 
    Benefits we mean those benefits to which working-age claimants of certain 
    means-tested benefits are automatically entitled. For example, free school 
    meals, free prescriptions, free dental treatment, etc.. We will consider the 
    range of Passported Benefits available to working-age claimants but the recommendations 
    will focus on the main Passported Benefits. We are particularly interested 
    in receiving views about benefits in kind but welcome responses relating to 
    cash benefits and discounts as well.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this short article, 
  I briefly examine the concept of Passported Benefits (PBs) as presented in the 
  consultation document of the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC) (http://ssac.independent.gov.uk). 
  Then I examine whether these needs would be met already within a CI scheme, 
  or whether special arrangements would have to be made.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Passported benefits 
  in the consultation document</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The SSAC's consultation 
  document's Annex B gives the consultation's Terms of Reference: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The purpose of 
    the advisory report is to analyse the range of passported benefits (&quot;benefits&quot;) 
    which currently exist in order to:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">classify the 
      target audience(s) for these benefits;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">identify the 
      needs which those benefits address, and the wider policy objectives served 
      by them now and in the future;</font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">identify and 
      analyse the mechanisms that are currently employed to determine entitlement; 
      </font></li>
    <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">consider the 
      potential impact of changes in eligibility rules.<br>
      <br>
      (The document's annex A comprises the table below)</font></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>target audience</i> 
  (recipients) for PBs comprises working-age claimants who are in receipt of certain 
  means-tested benefits (MTBs), such as Jobseeker's Allowance and certain Tax 
  Credits. It can therefore be assumed that the recipients are poor, and that 
  many of them will be living in poverty.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <i>purpose 
  of the benefits </i>appears to be to support low-income households, whether 
  out-of-work or in-work, in specific ways. Some are designed specifically to 
  help low income people meet the ordinary costs of raising children (Healthy 
  Start Vouchers, free school meals, and school clothing grants). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some PBs address 
  <i>exceptional circumstances</i> that lead to extra expenditure, such as Exemption 
  from Court Fees, Help with Prison Visiting Costs, and Legal Aid. These are circumstances 
  that most of us do not experience as a matter of course. Educational Grants 
  to enable gifted children to receive special training, for instance, in music 
  and dance, provide another example. The travel costs associated with healthcare, 
  and School Transport provision for those in rural areas, also fall into this 
  category. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many PBs can be 
  seen as<i> part of wider policies</i>, often representing an investment in the 
  future, (eg. our children's health and education), and in the general health 
  of the population (through free prescriptions, eye and dental care, leisure 
  services and healthcare travel costs), thereby reducing future National Health 
  Service bills. Similar considerations apply to the environment, such as Warm 
  Front, and bus and tram discount schemes. Others represent an attempt to redress 
  failures of public policy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Benefits-in-kind</i> 
  are often controversial, because they offer no choice compared with cash benefits. 
  Cash benefits permit the consumer the autonomy that most of us enjoy. Sometimes 
  it may be cheaper to give benefits-in-kind rather than cash, but often it is 
  a case of controlling benefit recipients because they are not trusted (rightly 
  or wrongly) to select what others regard as best for them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An interim statement 
  says this: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The information-gathering 
    phase of the Social Security Advisory Committee's review has found that more 
    than 25 different passported benefits are provided by government departments 
    and through local authorities. The committee's findings to date confirm that 
    passported benefits are viewed by many respondents as fulfilling important 
    needs. The consultation found that the value placed by claimants on individual 
    passported benefits differs depending on their personal circumstances; respondents' 
    views on the withdrawal and delivery of passported benefits were mixed. For 
    example, some respondents supported a tapered withdrawal whilst others favoured 
    a timed withdrawal when a claimant moves into work; and the design of passported 
    benefits should incentivise people to both move into work and stay in work. 
    (Hansard, 5 Oct 2011, Column WS75, Written Statement on Universal Credit)</font></p>

  will be published in the Spring.<br>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Citizen's Income 
  and passported benefits </i></font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our question is, 
  'Are the needs addressed by PBs already accounted for in a typical CI scheme, 
  and, if not, should they be, and how?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Full Citizen's 
  Income (FCI) would be expected to be adequate to meet the needs of the recipient, 
  including people over pension-entitlement age, people with disabilities, carers 
  of last resort, and the responsible parent of a dependent child. The more generous 
  the scheme, the more likely this is to be true. Thus, if the FCI and Child CI 
  (CCI) are sufficiently generous, then Passported Benefits should not be necessary. 
  If they were necessary, then it would represent a failure of the scheme.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Partial Citizen's 
  Income (PCI) would not meet all of the needs of the recipient and would not 
  be enough to live on. With this scheme, where exceptional needs are indicated, 
  the PBs should continue. But, the question arises: 'Should all those with the 
  exceptional needs receive these benefits, or only the poorest?' If the latter, 
  <i>how do we identify those on low incomes? </i>- because everybody would be 
  in receipt of a Partial Citizen's Income, so the benefit would not act as a 
  passport to PBs. As the PCI would not be enough to live on, it would need to 
  be topped up with other income, usually through earnings. There will be some 
  individuals who are unable to obtain even part-time work, and there will be 
  some areas that suffer from multiple deprivations, where opportunities for work 
  are thin on the ground. There will therefore have to be safety-net arrangements, 
  and a simple scheme, possibly in the form of a Housing Benefit, would have to 
  remain. Thus, those receiving a PCI and who are also receiving Housing Benefit 
  or some other safety-net assistance could be eligible to receive PBs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The largest group 
  in the population with exceptional circumstances are those with a variety of 
  disabilities, and a CI scheme would grant to all of these, without any means 
  test, a costs-of-disabilities package (for constant care, mobility, special 
  diets, etc.) in addition to their CIs. Here, the receipt of the package could 
  act as a passport to other PBs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Where the PBs are 
  seen to be part of a <i>wider policy</i>, one must question whether the PBs 
  for low-income, working-age adults, and especially<i> benefits-in-kind</i>, 
  are the best way to achieve the objectives. Investment in the early years of 
  childhood is known to pay large dividends to society later, in terms of healthy, 
  well-adjusted adults. Notwithstanding adequate FCIs and CCIs, maybe benefits-in-kind, 
  such as Healthy Start Vouchers, and free school meals, should be universally 
  available to all children. As well as education projects to inform people about 
  healthy diets and lifestyles, other instruments might be necessary, such as 
  subsidies on fresh fruit and vegetables, and taxes on processed food with significant 
  proportions of fat, salt and sugar. A CI is not a panacea for all social ills, 
  and, where other public provision is made, it will usually be better to get 
  the policy right in the first place, rather than to use benefits to paper over 
  the gaps.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Universal schemes, 
  such as the NHS, and universal benefits such as Child Benefit, are popular, 
  inclusive, and redistributive. If a generous CI scheme were to be introduced, 
  one might find that expenditure on other public services, such as health and 
  the criminal justice system, would fall significantly, especially where those 
  systems combat the effects of poverty. As with most things, it is cheaper to 
  prevent poverty than to deal with its fallout later.<br>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The<b> Pensions 
  Policy Institute</b> has published a report: <i>An assessment of the Government's 
  options for state pension reform</i>. The report concludes that the Government's 
  second option, a single tier state pension, 'would dramatically reduce the number 
  of pensioners reliant on means-tested benefits. The proportion of pensioner 
  households eligible to claim Pension Credit could fall from 35% of pensioner

  market economy and re-considered afresh against the reality of the coming sustainable

  from 2010 to 2020</i>. 'In the short run, relative child poverty is forecast 
  to remain broadly constant ..., before rising slightly in 2013-14. Relative 
  working-age adult poverty is forecast to rise slightly ... before rising faster 
  in 2013-14. Absolute child and working-age adult poverty are forecast to rise 
  continuously, and by more than relative poverty, over this period.' (p.1) This 
  unusual combination is because 'real median household income is forecast to 
  be 7% lower in 2012-13 than it was in 2009-10, and to remain below its 2009-10 
  level until at least 2015-16.' The report concludes that 'there is almost no

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <b>Organisation 
  for Economic Co-operation and Development</b> (OECD) has issued a new report, 
  <i>Divided We Stand: Why inequality keeps rising</i>. 'In OECD countries today, 
  the average income of the richest 10% of the population is about nine times 
  that of the poorest 10% - a ratio of 9 to 1. However, the ratio varies widely 
  from one country to another. It is much lower than the OECD average in the Nordic 
  and many continental European countries, but reaches 10 to 1 in Italy, Japan, 
  Korea, and the United Kingdom; around 14 to 1 in Israel, Turkey, and the United 
  States; and 27 to 1 in Mexico and Chile. &#133; Until the mid-1990s, tax-benefit 
  systems in many OECD countries offset more than half of the rise in market-income 
  inequality. However, while market income inequality continued to rise after 
  the mid-1990s, much of the stabilising effect of taxes and benefits on household 
  income inequality declined &#133; Reforming tax and benefit policies is the 
  most direct and powerful instrument for increasing redistributive effects. &#133; 
  However, redistribution strategies based on government transfers and taxes alone 
  would be neither effective nor financially sustainable. First, there may be 
  counter-productive disincentive effects if benefit and tax reforms are not well 
  designed. (<i>An Overview of Growing Income Inequalities in OECD Countries:

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>You have become 
  a strong advocate of cash transfers. Why so? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From my point of 
  view, cash transfers are an essential pillar of a comprehensive social protection 
  system. Social insurance was for an industrial society; it's not for the Indian 
  open economy of the 21st century. You can't have unemployment insurance - it 
  doesn't reach the poor. You can't have a means-tested system because we've seen 
  the problems with it. So, you're going to need to have some basic income transfer. 
  The technology to do it is rapidly emerging - in some respects, India is becoming 
  a world leader in this - and rolling this out within the next few years is certainly 
  within the capabilities of the Indian state, if there was a will to do so. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I think cash transfers 
  should be seen as whether they're good or bad in themselves. They should not 
  be discussed as an alternative to any specific policy. I do not think it is 
  fair or correct to see this debate around cash transfers as a substitute for 
  something else such as the public distribution system (PDS). I may have my criticisms 
  of the PDS but they are separate from the reasons why I think cash transfers 
  are good. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>That may apply 
  to cash transfers in general, but a general income cash transfer is not on the 
  policy table in India right now. The only cash transfers that are being discussed 
  within the government are those that replace subsidies. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I agree, but then 
  there should be a proper debate. Clearly, there are chronic inefficiencies in 
  the existing subsidy system. It goes right across the board, and anybody who 
  defends that system is just charging against a volume of evidence that says 
  it is chronically inefficient and inequitable and it is not solving poverty. 
  The Prime Minister knows that, Sonia Gandhi knows that. If we know that there 
  are very good reasons why a scheme doesn't work, then it is intellectually reprehensible 
  to continue in that direction. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>But many of 
  the problems in the PDS can be traced to targeting. The state of Tamil Nadu, 
  which has a universal PDS, has both the best record of reaching beneficiaries 
  and the lowest leakages. Why then are cash transfers the natural direction in 
  which you look, rather than universalisation of the PDS? </b> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I don't know enough 
  about Tamil Nadu, so I'm not going to say anything. Sure, you could universalise 
  if that's what works. But, I don't think that's an argument against cash transfers. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Even if it's 
  a targeted or conditional cash transfer, as is currently being proposed in India? 
  </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I really hope that 
  the conditionality issue can be defeated; I think that's the wrong way for India 
  to go. One just imagines the scope for corruption and inefficiency; the mind 
  boggles. I also hope that the simplicity and transparency of cash transfers 
  will be appreciated for what it is. I hope that policy makers will look at food 
  security as just a small part of overall security. We saw food security improve 
  dramatically in a universal cash transfer pilot programme in Namibian villages 
  as a result of not handing out food, but people having cash by which they could 
  buy seeds and grow things. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>You and the 
  BIEN repeatedly talk of a universal income transfer. However, when this is operationalised 
  by countries like Brazil, they do impose conditions and targeting. Isn't it 
  disingenuous to continue to talk of a universal income transfer when countries 
  take up only a targeted version? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The whole of my 
  professional career, I have advocated universalised and unconditional social 
  protection and cash transfers. You are right that in Brazil, it was not only 
  targeted in trying to reach just the poor, but it was also selected in trying 
  to reach just women. It was not universal and it was conditional. The realisation 
  was that the conditionality - sending kids to schools and attending clinics 
  - was merely helping to legitimise the cash transfers among the middle class. 
  But in 2004, Brazil passed a law committing the government to implement a universal, 
  unconditional cash transfer for the whole population. The objective has been 
  to roll it out and the number of beneficiaries has risen from 11 million to 
  60 million and the conditionality is being faded out. I foresee that something 
  like that could happen in India. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What was the 
  impact of the basic income cash transfer pilot in Namibia that you were a part 
  of? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Child school attendance 
  went up dramatically, use of medical clinics went up. Those with HIV/ AIDS started 
  to take ARTs (Antiretroviral Therapy drugs) because they'd been able to buy 
  the right sort of food with the cash. Women's economic status improved, and 
  the economic crime rate went down. Income distribution improved. This is very 
  relevant in India because with your existing handout of goods and even with 
  NREGA, you don't alter the structure of local economies; in fact, you almost 
  rigidify them. If you provide an equal amount of cash to all members of a community, 
  you are automatically giving proportionately more to the poor. If you do that, 
  you release the constraints that are on the lower income groups - they can pay 
  off their debts, they can take risks, and they can buy things that they need 
  for petty production. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Are there pilot 
  schemes going on in India? </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Social protection 
  policy develops best when it builds on pilots, because pilot schemes allow institutional 
  learning. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. The scheme that may evolve 
  in the Indian context may be unique - we don't know yet. But what would be sensible 
  is if there were calm, collected, quiet pilot schemes that were tried out with 
  good principles, were professionally advised, developed, and implemented - without 
  fanfare, without misrepresentation. I'm afraid that at the moment, the political 
  polemic is making sensible piloting harder. Too many people are posturing and 
  are keen to disrupt sensible, well-meant pilots being conducted. It is not in 
  the interests of anybody that pilots be disrupted or prevented. The Delhi situation 
  seems to have fallen into that trap and I think it's very sad.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The Delhi Pilot</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Delhi government, 
  in 2010, appointed the Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) and the India 
  Development Foundation to conduct a pilot study into cash transfers as a possible 
  alternative to the Public Distribution System (PDS). The pilot, which began 
  in January 2011, will run for one year in West Delhi's Raghubir Nagar slum. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">100 households 
  volunteered for cash transfers and will receive Rs 1,000 per month but will 
  have no access to the ration shop. Another 100 volunteer families will only 
  get a bank account and will continue to use the ration shop. The third volunteer 
  group of 150 families will neither receive cash nor a bank account and will 
  have to use the ration shop. The last group is of 150 families who did not want 
  cash transfers and will not receive it. All cash transfers will be made in the 
  name of the woman of the family. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The pilot will 
  study the consumption, expenditure, and nutrition of the four groups and compare 
  them against each other to determine the impact of cash transfers, and will 
  submit its findings to the government. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, the pilot 
  programme has faced serious opposition from NGOs opposed to cash transfers. 
  Members of these groups distributed pamphlets in the slum warning that participating 
  in the pilot would lead to ration shops shutting down, and disrupted public 
  meetings held by SEWA in the area. The pilot continues. RS<br>

  issue on the Mirrlees Review</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The completion 
  of the Institute for Fiscal Studies' review of taxation, chaired by Sir James 
  Mirrlees, Nobel Laureate and proposer of a theory on optimal taxation, has given 
  rise to three valuable volumes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Dimensions of 
  Tax Design</i> contains thirteen papers given at conferences organised as part 
  of the review, along with numerous associated commentaries. It would be difficult 
  to envisage a more comprehensive discussion of UK taxation policy, and even 
  if there had been no outcomes of the review beyond this collection of papers, 
  then the review would still have been worth conducting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of particular interest 
  to readers of this <i>Newsletter</i> will be the paper on 'Means-testing and 
  Tax Rates on Earnings'. Unfortunately, the paper starts off badly, as it suggests 
  that there is 'a trade-off between the goals of equity and efficiency: governments 
  want to transfer resources from the rich to the poor; on the other hand, such 
  transfers reduce people's incentive to work' (p.91). This is patently not true 
  of Child Benefit. It is only true of means-tested transfers. The rest of the 
  paper is better informed, and, on the basis of the evidence, it recommends that 
  'marginal rates ... when people enter work should be set low (and perhaps even 
  negative) for potential low earners rather than set high as the standard model 
  suggests' (p.91). The authors recommend a scheme which looks rather like Universal 
  Credit (pp.150-62). Also of interest will be the papers on labour supply and 
  taxes, on the tax base for direct taxation, on administration and compliance, 
  and on the political economy of tax policy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nowhere in the 
  collection is there any discussion of Child Benefit. This is a major omission.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The review's conclusions 
  are contained in <i>Tax by Design</i>, the title itself suggesting that a piecemeal 
  approach to taxation policy needs to be replaced by a more co-ordinated approach. 
  Of particular interest will be the chapter on integrating tax and benefits, 
  which can't find a good word to say about either our current benefits system 
  or Tax Credits. Again, there is no mention of Child Benefit. The authors propose 
  that Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions should be integrated, that 
  benefits should be integrated with each other, and that tax and benefits should 
  remain separate but their behaviours studied together. These suggestions reappear 
  in the report's final conclusions, as does the suggestion that effective tax 
  rates should be lowered for low earners. 'The current tax and benefit system 
  is unnecessarily complicated and induces too many people not to work or to work 
  too little. By creating a simpler and more rational system, minimizing disincentives 
  where they matter most, the reforms we propose have the potential to deliver 
  major economic gains' (pp.483-4). Yes; and to have asked about the current effects 
  of Child Benefit, the likely consequences of increasing its value, and the likely 
  effects of extending universal benefits into working-age cohorts, would have 
  enabled some even more important overall effects to have been achieved.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The September 2011 
  edition of <i>Fiscal Studies</i> repeats the recommendations contained in <i>Tax 
  by Design</i>. It contains a comparison of Tax by Design with the Meade Report 
  of 1978 and with taxation reviews in Australia and New Zealand (where government 
  sponsorship of the reviews has resulted in less radical proposals but ones which 
  might have more chance of immediate implementation); and a comparison of<i> 
  Tax by Design</i> with recent literature in the field. It also contains an article 
  which employs <i>Tax by Design</i>'s systemic and revenue-neutral approach to 
  question some of the report's conclusions, including its suggestion that effective 
  tax rates should be lowered for people potentially or actually in low-paid employment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are in the review 
  team's debt for their committed work on a wide-ranging review. The two volumes 
  and the September edition of <i>Fiscal Studies </i>will inform debate on tax 
  policy for many years to come. However, one omission does need to be remedied. 
  The Mirrlees Review did not review income maintenance, and it should have done. 
  In particular, there is no study of the different effects of contributory, means-tested 
  and universal benefits, nor of the ways in which they interact with each other 
  and with the tax system. We now need to see income maintenance tackled by a 
  review team with the same level of expertise and the same resources as the Mirrlees 
  Review. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The editors' introduction 
  to this volume of thoroughly researched conference papers shows just how much 
  has changed in OECD tax systems during the past few decades: flatter income 
  tax rates, ubiquitous VAT, the almost complete disappearance of wealth taxes, 
  a substantial reduction in excise duties, and much more. The separate chapters 
  discuss the reasons for these changes, and also such fields as corporate taxes, 
  environmental taxes, decentralized taxation, tax administration, and the relationships 
  between tax policy, politics, and research. The important debates within taxation 
  policy are discussed: the balance between direct and indirect taxation; different 
  types of taxations' relationships to economic stabilisation, growth, competitiveness, 
  and income redistribution; whether capital income should be taxed (yes, minimally); 
  how viable (national) corporate taxes are in a globalizing world; whether the 
  decline of wealth taxes and of excise duties is inexorable; how VAT and environmental 
  taxes are best designed; whether anything other than a property tax is a good 
  candidate for subnational taxation; and the extent to which administrative feasibility 
  should drive taxation policy. The final two chapters tackle two different influences 
  on tax system reform: politics, and research. The authors conclude that political 
  considerations are important determinants of tax systems, and particularly of 
  their complexity, and that research is more likely to follow policy change than 
  to lead it. Given this, the researcher's task 'is the long-term game of building 
  up the institutional capacity both within and outside governments to articulate 
  relevant ideas for change, to collect and analyze relevant data, and of course 
  to assess and criticize the effects of such changes as are made' (p.443).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of particular interest 
  to readers of this <i>Newsletter</i> will be chapter 3 on individual income 
  taxation. True tax credits are correctly understood as income tax allowances 
  which are paid out proportionately to the amount that earned income falls below 
  a threshold, and these are rightly seen as enhancing progressivity and as being 
  efficient to administer. (The UK's current 'Tax Credits' are a means-tested 
  benefit, and not tax credits.) 'To the extent that all tax credits and exemptions 
  were made refundable, this would turn the income tax system into a full-fledged 
  negative income tax system,' (p.105). The chapter identifies as problematic 
  both income transfers not delivered through the tax system, and tax credits 
  which change with a household's circumstances. It notes that enhancing refundable 
  tax credits delivered through the tax system to complement stand alone transfer 
  programs could go some way to alleviating poverty in the lower income range 
  (p.106). This is a lesson that the UK Government learnt during the early 1970s, 
  but has forgotten since.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At a point in the 
  discussion at which the UK's Child Benefit might have been discussed (where 
  universal education provision and the Child Trust Fund <i>are</i> discussed), 
  there is no mention of it; and what I didn't find in this collection was any 
  understanding of the administrative and other efficiencies related to a combination 
  of universal benefits and a progressive income tax. This is a pity in such a 
  wide-ranging collection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Positively important 
  to the Citizen's Income debate is the light which this collection throws on 
  a variety of possible funding methods. The chapter on environmental taxes is 
  relevant, as is the mention of land tax (p.337). What isn't in the collection 
  is any discussion of a field which will one day be important: transnational 
  taxation. There is now wide recognition of the possible utility of a 'Tobin' 
  financial transaction tax, including the European Commission's welcome recognition 
  that this kind of taxation would best be administered at regional level, and 
  therefore by the EU. Any future collection of papers on taxation policy really 
  will need to discuss the feasibility of transnational tax collection and whether 
  a financial transaction tax might fit into this category.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps it isn't 
  fair to say too much about what a book hasn't done when it's done so much already. 
  The book discusses many of the issues facing tax systems and attempts to reform 
  them, and it will be of considerable value both to policy-makers and to students 
  of taxation policy.</font></p>

  Alm (ed.),<i> The Economics of Taxation</i></b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>: 
  The International Library of Critical Writings in Economics 251, Edward Elgar, 
  2011, 2 volume set, xxxvii + 592 pp, and x + 695 pp, hbk, 1 84844 829 2, &pound;435</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The title of the 
  series to which these volumes belong contains an important ambiguity. A critique 
  is a careful examination of a subject, so a critical writing is a careful study 
  of the subject under review; but in common parlance 'critical' also means 'significant'. 
  (We might say that the title of the series contains a critical ambiguity.) It 
  is in this double sense that the writings contained in these volumes are 'critical'. 
  They are careful studies of aspects of taxation, and they are also significant, 
  in relation to the study of taxation, in relation to the social policy field 
  as a whole, and because they have been seminal in their field. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the editor's 
  introduction states, taxation policy has multiple goals: adequacy (to collect 
  enough revenue - we see the consequences of not doing so in the current plights 
  of a number of Eurozone countries), equity, and efficiency (in the sense that 
  taxation should interfere as little as possible with firms' and individuals' 
  decisions in markets for labour and other commodities). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The papers collected 
  in these two volumes fall into sections on the effects of taxation (equity, 
  income distribution, efficiency, revenue collection, economic growth, and politics), 
  optimal taxation, tax reform, individuals' decisions (in relation to incentives, 
  labour supply, saving, portfolio choice, capital gains, estate taxes, tax evasion, 
  and income reporting) and business decisions (in relation to capital taxation, 
  investment, and financial structure). Many of the papers, and the collection 
  as a whole, offer a good balance between theory and practice. A good example 
  of such balance is Fullerton's paper 'On the possibility of an inverse relationship 
  between tax rates and government revenue' - and it is in this paper that we 
  find a clue to an important problem related to any attempt at a collection of 
  papers on taxation. 'Welfare programs that make recipients ineligible at a given 
  income level imply effective marginal tax rates of 100 percent or higher' (p.20 
  of Fullerton's article, p.272 of volume I of the collection). For UK residents 
  in receipt of the means-tested 'Tax Credits', the rate of withdrawal of the 
  benefit is at least as important a determinant of labour market decisions as 
  is the income tax rate. Similarly, Slemrod's conclusions about behavioural responses 
  to changing tax rates and changing tax avoidance possibilities apply as much 
  to benefit rates and income non-declaration as they do to tax rates and tax 
  avoidance. Hausmann's paper on labour supply correctly identifies transfer payments' 
  effects on net income as an important factor (p.37 of his article, p.27 of volume 
  II of the collection). All this is to say that many of the conclusions drawn 
  in the papers are generalizable to the characteristics and effects of means-tested 
  and other benefits, and to the combinations of benefits and taxes that many 
  people experience. To incorporate consideration of household-based means-tested 
  benefits into the theoretical models employed by many of the papers (and particularly 
  in papers such as Atkinson's and Stiglitz's on the design of tax structures) 
  would considerably complicate the mathematics, but it is surely essential to 
  attempt this, which suggests that many of the papers here really are, as they 
  themselves suggest, starting-points still awaiting further development.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is a pity that 
  this two volume collection contains no index. To have included one would have 
  considerably enhanced usefulness of the set to researchers. But that is the 
  only problem. This collection, which will be consulted mainly in libraries, 
  will give to students of taxation a valuable source of critical writings to 
  aid their studies. What we need now is a similar collection of papers which 
  study tax and benefits systems together, which study their combined behavioural 
  effects, and which discuss the policy consequences of those effects. Atkinson's 
  work on a flat tax and a Citizen's Income would surely find an honoured place 
  in such a collection. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Policy-makers need 
  to integrate tax and benefits policies, and preferably tax and benefits. A collection 
  on the economics of tax and benefits as good as Alm's on the economics of taxation 
  would be of considerable assistance. </font></p>

  a Citizen's Income an 'economic stabilisation grant' because it would boost 
  aggregate demand, more efficiently allocate resources, and tackle uncertainty

  and a failing paradigm can find itself displaced - but only if a new paradigm 
  is ready to take its place (p.21):</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One modest recommendation 
    is that the emerging generation of economists and social policy students should 
    urge their peers, and particularly the new political leaders, to match their 
    rhetoric about being 'radical' by assessing genuinely radical ideas. Economics 
    is a constantly unfolding body of thought, and those charged with implementing 
    economic and social policy should face demands to think afresh and evaluate 
    alternatives with open minds. (p.22)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Almaz Zelleke suggests 
  that a feminist theory of justice requires a Citizen's Income, and that such 
  a universal unconditional income would promote a more gender-inclusive citizenship. 
  'Most importantly, basic income indirectly compensates care and society's other 
  unpaid work without reinforcing the existing gendered distribution of labour 
  or the primacy of the public sphere by equating care with work' (p.38). Louise 
  Haagh's following article notes the correlation between a country's level of 
  equality and its citizens' control over their time, and seeks a balance between 
  employment and non-employment which she believes would be best served by a Citizen's 
  Income in a social insurance context. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stuart White discusses 
  two different 'citizen's endowments': a Citizen's Income, and universal capital 
  grant. 'Freedom' and 'entitlement' arguments fail to separate the two options, 
  and the way in which different 'freedom' arguments lead in different directions 
  suggests that a combination of a Citizen's Income and a universal capital grant 
  might be the best option. Leading to the same conclusion, Tony Fitzpatrick discusses 
  the concept of paternalism, distinguishes between a variety of types, recommends 
  a 'social paternalism' that prioritises autonomy but doesn't exclude other values, 
  and suggests that a Citizen's Income and a universal grant together will best 
  promote such a social paternalism. </font></p>

  established to make labour markets more flexible, then be increased in order 
  to create a new basis for citizenship, or will it remain small and fulfil only 
  its initial purpose? 'The first steps towards basic income may become politically 
  feasible for a variety of reasons, at a number of different developmental stages, 
  all of which will also be perilous for the principle in various ways' (p.112) 
  - but those steps should not for that reason be rejected: 'Social policy can 
  seldom deal in pure principles or utopian solutions, and basic income is no 
  exception. It cannot resolve all the challenges of globalisation &#133; in a 
  single reform, but these measures may be a step in the right direction' (p.112).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, J&uuml;rgen 
  De Wispelaere and Lindsay Stirton study 'the administrative efficiency of basic 
  income'. Identifying those people entitled to a Citizen's Income would be a 
  necessary administrative task, and a variety of payment methods might be needed 
  in order to reach the maximum number of payees, so administration of a Citizen's 
  Income would not be as simple as some might think. The authors discuss a dilemma: 
  'Proponents can claim important administrative savings for basic income, <i>provided 
  they restrict those arguments to the most radical paradigmatic form</i>, while 
  simultaneously having to face up to the reality that this radical version of 
  basic income may face insurmountable political obstacles' (p.121: their italics). 
  De Wispelaere and Stirton also quite properly suggest that a Citizen's Income 
  isn't the only way to make administrative savings: other forms of administrative 
  simplification are possible, such as the sharing of information between tax 
  and benefits authorities and aligning tax and benefits rules with each other. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To round off the 
  substantive articles section of this focused and comprehensive edition of <i>Policy 
  and Politics </i>with De Wispelaere's and Stirton's article, which concludes 
  that 'administrative efficiency &#133; is &#133; political' (p.128), seems really 
  quite appropriate. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is an exploration 
  of the complex relationship between social policy and the environmental challenges 
  which we all face, with social policy here defined as 'systematic public interventions 
  relating to social needs, well-being and problems' (p.2) - and the relationship 
  really is complex because, whereas in the short term there might be a trade-off 
  between money spent on protecting the environment and money spent on health, 
  housing and education, in the longer term money <i>not</i> spent on protecting 
  the environment will impact on health, housing and education. In the other direction, 
  social policies in areas such as fuel poverty will have an impact positively 
  or negatively on the environment; social policies have often been designed to 
  promote economic growth, and this has an impact on the environment; and to redirect 
  the aims of social policy will have an impact, too, and preferably one which 
  will steer us away from the worst of the possible climate change outcomes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the first chapter 
  Hodgson and Phillips describe the causes and implications of climate change 
  and the depletion of non-renewable resources, and they discuss the different 
  solutions available: mitigation, adaptation, geoengineering, and conservation. 
  In chapter 2 Hannigan asks how ecologically valid solutions can be politically 
  feasible when economic growth appears to be <i>the</i> political imperative. 
  Any useful solution will therefore need to moderate consumption by the wealthy 
  and provide a basic level of security for the poor so that they don't need to 
  destroy the forests. In chapter 3 Fitzpatrick discusses environmentalists' criticisms 
  of social policy's current presuppositions, and outlines a 'green economy' and 
  the social policy agenda to which it would give rise (for instance: 'How can 
  social insurance systems be adapted to cope with collective uncertainties?' 
  (p.84))</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chapters follow 
  on the state's (historically understood) role in environmental protection, environmental 
  (consequentialist) ethics, philosophies (of environmental justice), and environmental 
  policy (markets, regulation, and education); and then chapters on particular 
  social policy fields: health, urban planning, transport, employment, citizenship 
  and care, and international development and global poverty.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fitzpatrick's concluding 
  chapter is an eloquent description of the options facing us: a sustainable global 
  society, the human race clinging to survival at the Earth's poles, and something 
  between the two. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In Fitzpatrick's 
  chapter on environmental justice there is a discussion of a Citizen's Income's 
  complex relationship to environmentally sustainable social policy, and at various 
  points social insurance and taxation are discussed, but there is no chapter 
  on income maintenance. This policy area<i> is</i> discussed in his <i>Freedom 
  and Security </i>(Macmillan 1999) and in his <i>Environment and Welfare</i> 
  (Palgrave 2002), but a chapter here would have aided our 'understanding [of] 
  the environment and social policy'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The proof reading

  Dorling, <i>Injustice: Why social inequality persists</i></font>, Policy Press, 
  2011, xvii + 403 pp, pbk 1 847 42720 5, &pound;9.99</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Daniel Dorling's 
  <i>Injustice </i>(reviewed in the <i>Citizen's Income Newsletter</i>, edition 
  3 for 2010) has been reissued in paperback with a new foreword by Richard Wilkinson 
  and Kate Pickett and a new afterword by the author.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the book, Dorling 
  gathers evidence for 'continued belief in the tenets of injustice' (p.13): 'Elitism 
  is efficient', 'exclusion is necessary', 'prejudice is natural', 'greed is good', 
  and 'despair is inevitable' - tenets imbibed by the wealthy as they grow up, 
  and which perpetuate them in power and perpetuate their power; and tenets in 
  which many others acquiesce. Dorling persuasively argues that the result is 
  growing inequality, and it is surely shocking that 'in countries such as Britain 
  people last lived lives as unequal as today, as measured by wage inequality, 
  in 1854, when Charles Dickens was writing <i>Hard Times</i>' (p.316).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Presumably Wilkinson 
  and Pickett were asked to write the new Foreword because of the success of their 
  book <i>The Spirit Level</i>, which found that inequality (sometimes understood 
  as income inequality, and sometimes more generally understood) was correlated 
  to a variety of social ills. In their significant Foreword to <i>Injustice </i>they 
  do as we suggested in a review in a previous edition of the <i>Citizen's Income 
  Newsletter</i> (issue 1 for 2010), and have located the causes of inequality 
  and of various other social ills in deeper social structures - social structures 
  which they interestingly suggest have prehistoric and indeed pre-human origins. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dorling's new Afterword 
  is equally significant. The Coalition Cabinet contains more millionaires than 
  any other in the last hundred years, and Dorling shows that in the interests 
  of the &eacute;lite which they represent, Cabinet members are consistent exponents 
  of the 'tenets of injustice'. He suggests that they have established a new higher 
  education funding regime likely to restrict higher education to a social elite 
  because they believe that elitism is efficient. Perhaps he's right. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Afterword locates 
  the cure for all of this injustice in changed beliefs, as does the original 
  book, but there is little to suggest how this might be achieved apart from the 
  idea that we should fortify ourselves for the journey by reminding ourselves 
  that things have sometimes changed for the better. This lack of a prescription 
  raises an important question: Do we change behaviour by changing beliefs, or 
  is it the other way round? The process is probably circular, which means that 
  behavioural and structural change will be important methods of changing people's 
  beliefs, and vice versa. To take an example: Enforced good behaviour in the 
  workplace in relation to racial equality has promoted belief in racial equality, 
  and increasing belief in racial equality has promoted better workplace practice. 
  If the process is circular in this way then we shall need to construct 'equality 
  mechanisms' if we are to see people's beliefs change.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Needless to say, 
  Child Benefit, a Citizen's Pension, and then a Citizen's Income, will be such 
  mechanisms. This leads us to suggest that, at last year's Conservative Party 
  Conference, George Osborne announced that Child Benefit would be deuniversalised 
  because, in its present universal form, Child Benefit represents everything 
  which the 'tenets of injustice' are against. </font></p>

  Policy Press, 2011, xiv + 397 pp, pbk, 1 847 42879 0, &pound;24.99</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this book Daniel 
  Dorling has brought together fifty-two of his academic papers, newspaper articles, 
  magazine articles, and unpublished essays, to create a nicely structured and 
  really quite devastating critique of our unequal society: devastating because 
  so carefully researched. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The book contains 
  sections on inequality and poverty, injustice and ideology, race and identity, 
  education and hierarchy, elitism and geneticism, mobility and employment, bricks 
  and mortar, wellbeing and misery, and advocacy and action. Most of the sections 
  follow the same pattern: a scene-setter (often a newspaper article); then mainly 
  articles from peer-reviewed journals; and finally a newspaper or magazine article, 
  or occasionally a final journal article, suggesting a policy direction which 
  might reduce inequality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thus the section 
  on inequality and poverty opens with an article on murder: 'Behind the man with 
  the knife is ... the man who decided that his school did not need funding, the 
  man who closed down the plant where he could have worked, the man who decided 
  to reduce benefit levels so a black economy grew ...' (p.25). Then come articles 
  showing how economic growth is generally higher in urban areas nearer to London, 
  and that 'society in Britain has become so divided that very few people live 
  anywhere where they can see how a representative range of folk live' (p.55). 
  Finally there's a more political piece: 'Cameron says he is worried about &quot;deep 
  poverty&quot;, about the poorest in society. But he clearly does not want a 
  redistribution of the money, the land, the work, the educational resources and 
  the &quot;opportunities&quot; that the rich have expropriated from the poor 
  over the past three decades' (p.59).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are two respects 
  in which the introduction isn't quite accurate. Dorling claims that he's edited 
  the articles and extracts so that they have a consistent style, but there is 
  still a considerable difference between the style of an article written for 
  the <i>Guardian</i> and one written for the peer-reviewed <i>Local Economy</i>. 
  The introduction also says that each section ends with a discussion of what 
  we can do about the inequality evidenced. In many of the sections this is only 
  true in the sense that Dorling asks that a current policy trend should be reversed. 
  In just one section he proposes a new policy direction: a land tax (p.129). 
  I suspect that this is because he's a geographer and has studied our unequal 
  land distribution and the many other ways in which 'place ... matters in what 
  might inspire (or condition) you. Circumstances matter' (p.343), and where we 
  grow up has a considerable effect on our opportunities and prospects. In the 
  same vein, Dorling shows how recent Housing Benefit changes will result in 'the 
  cleansing and clearing out of so many poorer people (and people made newly poor) 
  from more prosperous areas of the country' (p.99). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As well as being 
  Professor of Human Geography at the University of Sheffield, Dorling is President 
  of the Society of Cartographers, and this book would be worth buying simply 
  for the full-colour maps which say more about inequality than words alone could 
  say. However, the main reason for buying this book has to be the sheer variety 
  of evidence which it offers for an increasing social malaise. We are sleepwalking 
  into a seriously unequal society. A land tax would help to reduce that inequality. 
  To distribute the proceeds as a Citizen's Income would make even more of a positive 
  difference.</font></p>

  Lowe, <i>The Housing Debate</i></font>, Policy Press, 2011, 1 847 42273 6, pbk, 
  280pp, &pound;14.99</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stuart Lowe's <i>The 
  Housing Debate</i> takes a refreshingly broad view of housing and welfare. Rather 
  than a balanced introduction for students to current debates around housing 
  and social policy, Lowe has a clear case to make. 'There is mounting evidence 
  that housing is not only an important pillar of welfare states, but, looked 
  at in its broadest sense, has become a foundation.' (p33)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Through a series 
  of historical and thematic chapters, Lowe argues that there is a fundamental 
  connection between housing systems and the type of welfare states that develop 
  from them and alongside them. In the UK, the growth of home ownership from the 
  mid twentieth-century and the liberalisation of mortgage markets from the 1980s 
  have been integral to developing our asset-based welfare state, where individuals 
  and families use personal wealth to buy into welfare. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 260 pages, Lowe 
  doesn't attempt to offer a comprehensive history of housing policy; rather, 
  he draws out key themes and illustrative aspects of housing policy that have 
  helped shape both the current structures of the welfare state and political 
  debates about housing. Historians and welfare experts may occasionally be frustrated 
  by this brevity. Indeed, its introductory style is occasionally prone to over-simplify, 
  oto gloss over important subtleties. This includes, for instance, the changes 
  to social housing to be introduced through the Localism Bill currently before 
  Parliament, which Lowe reduces to 'effectively creating a mirror image of the 
  tenancy arrangements in the privately rented sector'. (p4) However, readers 
  already interested in tax, welfare and benefits, but who come fresher to the 
  housing debate, will value the clear structure and the balance between history 
  and welfare theory. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The historical 
  account begins by identifying the emergence of a distinct housing policy from 
  Victorian public health concerns, and then traces the socio-economic roots of 
  the modern concept of home-ownership in the interwar years. Those interested 
  in a Citizen's Income might be particularly taken by Lowe's comparative analysis 
  of housing markets across Europe and the US. He focuses on the divergence of 
  a municipal approach to housing in Britain, where state housing was an acceptable 
  response to a dwindling private rented market, and Germany, where a social insurance 
  model and related scepticism of a statist approach helped more diverse provision 
  to develop through housing co-operatives. One can see this initial split at 
  the start of the twentieth century extending and deepening. The author's perception 
  of the 1961 Housing Act is that it was the end of a brief period of reliance 
  on the private rented sector and the return to housing provision by local authorities. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lowe's distinctive 
  offer is in Chapters 6 and 8, where he argues for a clearer role for housing 
  in the analysis of welfare states. The Housing Debate neatly contrasts a historical 
  analysis with literature on comparative welfare to argue that different approaches 
  to housing have shaped very different welfare systems. In the UK, this means 
  asset-based welfare. This is, in part, due to home-ownership's significant initial 
  costs that lead to electorates in countries with high proportions of home-owners 
  favouring low taxes, low interest rates, and low spend social policies. And 
  so one trade off to be made is between home-ownership and pension provision. 
  Lowe identifies examples of explicitly asset-based welfare, including the Child 
  Trust Funds in the UK and the experiment with individual asset bonds for low 
  income families in the US. And as the author indicates in his conclusion, there 
  is much still left to consider in the welfare debate, once we acknowledge that 
  housing is part of a state model where citizens are expected to secure savings 
  and assets to contribute to welfare.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This book has been 
  written to persuade students of social and public policy to take housing seriously. 
  The debate should stretch further than this. It provides a very timely analysis 
  as policymakers turn again to reconsider housing policy in the face of slow 
  economic growth, accelerating private rents, and projections for the costs of 
  social care for an ageing population. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The number of degree 
  course modules on 'citizenship' is increasing, and this book is designed as 
  a core text; but it will be useful not just to teachers and students, but also 
  to social policy practitioners and politicians because the contested and complex 
  concept of citizenship now informs debate on all manner of social policy issues, 
  as this book amply shows.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is material 
  here on republicanism and liberalism, the development of social citizenship 
  in Britain, political ideologies since the 1950s, class, poverty, gender, disability, 
  race, ethnicity, social Europe, and global citizenship (with a question mark).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those interested 
  in the tax and benefits system will find relevant material in most chapters 
  - not surprisingly, given the importance of the term 'citizen' to much social 
  policy debate and the connections between the tax and benefits system and so 
  many social policy fields.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of particular interest 
  will be the material on the relationship between class, poverty, citizenship 
  and welfare to be found in chapter 5. Increasing conditionality in relation 
  to benefits policy was a feature of the last government, and we are waiting 
  to see whether the same will be true of the new one. The chapter contains an 
  informative table of new conditionalities in a variety of social policy fields.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citizenship suggests 
  universalism, but it also has to cope with difference ( - a theme running through 
  the book), and the final chapter outlines three approaches to the relationship 
  between universalism and difference: a Citizen's Income, group rights, and differentiated 
  universalism.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The erroneous argument 
  that a Citizen's Income would be 'too expensive' is, as usual, offered without 
  evidence. Similarly, the idea that 'for some a [Citizen's Income] is a step 
  too far as everybody, freeloaders included, would be able to claim their citizen's 
  income' (p.208) receives a response in terms of a participation income rather 
  than the challenge which it deserves. He does concede that 'freeloaders already 
  receive means-tested benefits and these benefits actively discourage them from 
  seeking employment: a Citizen's Income wouldn't do that', but it's encouraging 
  to see a Citizen's Income taken seriously as the feasible corollary to social 
  citizenship.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given the importance 
  of a Citizen's Income and citizenship to each other, a future edition of this 
  excellent book would benefit from an extended and better informed treatment 
  of both Child Benefit and Citizen's Income, which should be treated together 
  rather than separately as they are in this volume.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>This article

  We are grateful to permission to republish it.</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unemployment hit 
  a 17-year high in the three months prior to August. That's headline stuff. Short-term 
  employment is less noticed. In the same period, more people than ever before 
  (as number and proportion) reclaimed Job Seekers Allowance less than six months 
  after their last claim. Over half of men claimants are in that situation, and 
  about a third of women (as set out www.poverty.org.uk/57/index.shtml?2). Disabled 
  job-seekers are proportionally likelier to be in this situation. These are people 
  of an insecure world, the 'precariat'. (See Guy Standing's <i>The Precariat: 
  the new dangerous class</i>.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This trend towards 
  short-term 'flexible' working is economic and social folly, in the long term 
  if not the short. Having spent many years largely out of the labour market through 
  mental disorder, I know how destructive insecure work can be.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Generalisation 
  is perilous. In many small and larger firms, recession-driven redundancy apart, 
  employment remains relatively stable. The thrust, though, is towards flexibility. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is driven 
  by technology: digitisation makes continual modification affordable and hence 
  competitively necessary. Workers must adapt to technology, not the other way 
  round. They must be quick-learners, or readily disposable, or both.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It's also been 
  driven by rising shareholder power since the 1970s. Corporate investors typically 
  look to immediate profits. In 1965 US pension funds held stocks for an average 
  of 46 months; by 2000 the comparable figure was 3.8 months. (R. Sennett, <i>The 
  Culture of the New Capitalism</i>). Management must prioritise today's share 
  price or risk hostile buy-out. That depends on labour flexibility. Even voluntary-sector 
  agencies must hire and fire to fit funding requirements. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The flexible workforce 
  is integral to LibCon growth strategies. 'We will review employment and workplace 
  laws, for employers and employees, to ensure they maximise flexibility for both 
  parties while protecting fairness and providing the competitive environment 
  required for enterprise to thrive', said the Coalition Agreement. The Chancellor's 
  announcement that (save for discrimination claims) people must work twice as 
  long for their employer before being protected by Employment Tribunals came 
  straight out of the flexible employment manual. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What does this 
  mean for people returning to the workforce, particularly those with mental health 
  problems? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'The positive link 
  between employment and mental health is proven&#133; In contrast, there is evidence 
  that the longer individuals are absent or out of work, the more likely they 
  are to experience depression and anxiety. Satisfying work can therefore play 
  a vital role in improving everyone's well-being and mental health.' (DWP/DH, 
  Working our way to better mental health: a framework for action, December 2009). 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I agree, on conditions. 
  I only began to regain some sense of my stable 'self' after finding work with 
  Cambridge Citizens Advice Bureau. Income and its self-respect matters hugely; 
  employment can also represent structure, an outlet for energies, hope of a future, 
  colleagueship. You may no longer have to fudge answers to 'what do you do?' 
  or, devastatingly, 'what are you?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But there's work 
  and work. Insecure, low-paid work means none of these. Precarians are a world 
  apart from skilled, well-networked professionals who thrive on mobility. Job 
  Seekers Allowance requires you - after an initial few weeks - to accept any 
  'reasonable' offer. You must become whatever is demanded, unable to build a 
  personal skill-set, devoid of colleagueship. You've still no answer to 'what 
  do you do?', let alone &quot;what are you?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For any returnee, 
  this is tough: the endlessly repeated angst of facing the unknown, being tested, 
  knowing there's no time for learning by mistakes. A mistake too many and you 
  return to Go. For many, it's impossible. Minister of State Chris Grayling recently 
  talked on the Today programme about Universal Credit helping young people to 
  take that critical 'first step' into work. He's out of touch. There is no one 
  'first step' but a whole series of them. These may, for the securer person, 
  build confidence. For the less secure, being burnt doesn't callous the skin 
  but makes it raw.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anxiety and depression 
  were my bugbears, along with a few obsessive compulsions. Being unable to connect 
  with the world around is terrifying. This is not about something being difficult 
  or unpleasant, nor about feeling a bit down or fuzzy-headed. It's about impossibility. 
  About struggling to make that muscle called 'brain' move, but being paralysed. 
  Many of us know what it's like to be 'not here' ('derealisation' in the jargon); 
  to sort-of know that 'I' am 'walking along the road'. Many of us know the grip 
  of compulsions which must be obeyed before all else, and/or the addictions - 
  to alcohol, drugs, eating or not eating - whose claws are no less sharp. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neither paralysis 
  nor compulsion can be wished or disciplined away, nor will they vanish on exposure 
  to the thing that's feared. If only they would. Many of us keep hoping, trying 
  to force ourselves to master them. Many flog themselves (or cut themselves, 
  or drink) in bitter self-contempt. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Anxiety is part 
  of life. 'One in four has mental health problems' says the Time to Change campaign 
  (www.time-to-change.org.uk/). But difference in degree becomes difference in 
  kind. A physical illness like arthritis can be uncomfortable or disabling. So 
  can anxiety. There are ways to ease the effects of both. But unlike arthritis, 
  recovery from mental illness is often to a large degree possible - at the right 
  pace, with the right environment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The flexible workplace 
  is wrong in both. It sustains the fear. For obsessives, control by others is 
  a consuming terror. Fear of not coping can dominate for years. Familiarity can 
  ease the strain, reducing the unknowns, allowing coping mechanisms to evolve. 
  One can develop a work persona, invaluable to most of us as protection and tool. 
  Above all, time may allow the growth of trust and respect, in others and in 
  self. But time is what the flexible workplace denies. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I talked up my 
  skills to get a job, then faced the brain-numbing expectations of a fast-driving 
  employer. I wasn't asked back. Such 'first steps' can destroy. People on JSA 
  have to undergo them again and again. Being lucky in my support systems, I could 
  restart as a volunteer, then creep onwards via undemanding admin work. I didn't 
  dread abject dismissal when my mind would not work. I could return to volunteer 
  status without question or loss of respect, still with a possible way forward. 
  So I climbed - as securely as I could - out of the pit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Employment &amp; 
  Support Allowance is supposed to give such space, though in practice it's far 
  tighter. The minute you can do some kind of work, that's what you have to do. 
  That work is usually short-term, never secure. So now a record number of people 
  must &quot;take the plunge&quot; again and again, never knowing colleagueship, 
  never having hope of sustained progression, emotionally or professionally. Never 
  being granted the respect we all deserve until proven otherwise. Most unemployed 
  people I meet desperately want to work. They don't need sanctions and conditionality 
  to force them into it. They need the security and opportunity which our economic 
  model does not provide. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Flexible work is 
  a good formula for ensuring a captive supply of cheap, low-grade employees. 
  It supports the short-termism that has maimed many leading companies but pleased 
  the City. It promotes festering resentments against both the privileged rich 
  and the competing poor, especially immigrants. It condemns many to a lifetime 
  of fear, poverty and loss of hope. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No economic model 
  is inevitable. We set our priorities. Fiscal incentives and regulation can encourage 
  investment in employees. Unions can reshape themselves as long-term home-bases 
  for precarians. A tax-funded basic income can give people security for take-off. 
  Respect and trust can replace stigma and sanctions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nor is democratic 
  freedom inevitable. I am afraid of the inequalities growing in our society: 
  the resentments, fears and angers. I am afraid of where indifference to these 
  realities, in government and the comfortable classes, is leading us. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Post-war European 
  peace was built, however imperfectly, on a commitment to investment in all classes, 
  investing in them, respecting them and allowing them to insure against calamity. 
  In renewed time of upheaval, we need to make a similar commitment.</font></p>
