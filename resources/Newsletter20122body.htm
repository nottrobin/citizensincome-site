<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Child Benefit</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In September 2010 
  the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that he would withdraw 100% of Child 
  Benefit from any household in which someone was paying higher rate Income Tax 
  (currently anyone earning over &pound;42,475, that is, &pound;7,475 personal 
  allowance plus &pound;35,000 taxable income). During his budget statement on 
  the 21st March 2012 he announced 'that Child Benefit will be withdrawn through 
  an income tax charge, and that the charge will only apply to households where 
  someone has an income over &pound;50,000 a year. For households where someone 
  has an income between &pound;50,000 and &pound;60,000 the charge will apply 
  gradually, preventing a cliff edge effect. Only households where someone has 
  an income in excess of &pound;60,000 a year will no longer gain from Child Benefit.' 
  We are pleased to see that the Chancellor is capable of undertaking a U-turn, 
  presumably because it had dawned on him that actually withdrawing Child Benefit 
  from high-earning families would be an administrative nightmare, and because 
  the 'cliff-edge' was proving unpopular amongst the Conservative Party's core 
  voters. Child Benefit will no longer be withdrawn from anyone, so it is again 
  a universal benefit. Whether the Chancellor's plan for a tax on children will 
  meet with universal approval is an interesting question. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font size="3">Plan 
  B</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In response to 
  the Government's current policies for reducing the debt generated by the previous 
  Government's bail-out of the banks, the Compass thinktank has published <i>Plan 
  B: a good economy for a good society</i> (<a href="http://www.compassonline.org.uk/news/item.asp?n=13946">www.compassonline.org.uk/news/item.asp?n=13946</a>). 
  It's full of good ideas: investment in renewable energy and in energy conservation; 
  government support for new technology; the separation of retail and investment 
  banking; a financial transaction tax; and a social investment strategy. These 
  parts of the report are well argued.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But when the report 
  turns to the tax and benefits system we find a suggestion that means-tested 
  benefit rates should be raised so that people on lower incomes can receive higher 
  incomes which they can then spend in order to stimulate the economy (p.20). 
  The report shows no understanding of the fact that to increase the levels of 
  means-tested benefits will still carry the disincentive effects associated with 
  the withdrawal of means-tested benefits higher up the earnings range, thus extending 
  higher labour market disincentives to additional sections of the workforce. 
  </font></p>
<font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The present Secretary 
of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, does understand these disincentive 
effects. That is why he proposed a single means-tested benefit to replace nearly 
all other means-tested benefits, and a total withdrawal rate of 55%. In the end 
he had to agree to a 65% withdrawal rate, but this will still reduce the total 
withdrawal rates for numerous households who are at present suffering from 85% 
withdrawal rates and in some cases 95%. </font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is little 
  of the 'plan B' about means-tested benefits. A genuine plan B would understand 
  that universal benefits combined with a progressive tax system successfully 
  target money on the poor at the same time as increasing incentives and choice 
  in the labour market. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The report asks 
  that people should be more able to opt for shorter working hours, but the editors 
  don't seem to have noticed that means-tested benefits lock people into full-time 
  employment, whereas universal benefits make part-time employment more of an 
  option. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Plan B: a good 
  economy for a good society</i> offers a genuine plan B in many social policy 
  fields. A genuine plan B in the tax and benefits field would most welcome. We 
  would be happy to assist.<br>

  Citizen's Income Scheme and its Lessons</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by Hamid Tabatabai</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>A big idea &#133;</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In December 2010, 
  Iran became the first country in the world to establish a nationwide Citizen's 
  or Basic Income scheme. Interestingly, the scheme did not emerge by design but 
  by default: it was the by-product of an effort to reform an outdated system 
  of price subsidies that concerned primarily fuel products. A basic income proved 
  to be the most practical way of compensating the population for the loss of 
  subsidies that had been costing some US$100-120 billion a year. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the first 
  phase of the reform process became operational on 19 December 2010, nearly half 
  of the subsidies were slashed overnight. At the same time, every Iranian became 
  entitled to a monthly 'cash subsidy' of about US$40 payable to heads of households 
  (e.g. $200 for a household of five members). In the first year of the scheme 
  $40 billion were returned to households in compensation. Nearly the entire population 
  of 75 million is now covered although some 1-2 million people have decided not 
  to claim it. The second phase of the reform is expected to go into effect shortly, 
  entailing further cuts in price subsidies and a corresponding addition to the 
  transfer amount. Later phases will operate on the same principle until domestic 
  prices of subsidised goods and services are brought into line with international 
  or cost prices within the five year period of the reform effort. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The big idea has 
  therefore been to convert price subsidies into cash subsidies. The objective 
  is twofold: improving economic efficiency through rationalisation of subsidised 
  prices, and reducing income disparities through cash transfers. These were reflected 
  in the main provisions of the Subsidy Reform Law of January 2010 that is now 
  being implemented. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>&#133; yielding 
  results &#133;</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The reform process 
  was launched over a year ago and evidence is now beginning to appear on the 
  results. The Central Bank figures suggest that while the initial price shock 
  accelerated inflationary pressures, the impact has not been as dire as had been 
  predicted by some observers. The annual rate of urban inflation in the months 
  preceding the reform was 9-10 percent. With the launch of the reform on 19 December 
  2010, this rate started climbing by about 1 percentage point a month to reach 
  20.6 percent in December 2011. The acceleration appears to have been entirely 
  due to price reform. The relatively subdued impact on overall inflation - when 
  subsidised prices had been raised several-fold - was due in part to price controls 
  that were intensified when the reform was launched. Price controls have since 
  been relaxed but not entirely withdrawn. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Official data also 
  show substantial declines in the consumption of fuel across the board. Between 
  2010 and 2011, the years before and after the reform, the average daily consumption 
  of petrol fell by 5.6 percent, diesel fuel by 10 percent, liquid gas by 10.6 
  percent, furnace oil by 36.5 percent, and electricity by 8 percent. These savings 
  are all the more remarkable in view of past trends that witnessed growth of 
  the order of 10 percent a year in the consumption of fuel and electricity. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Income effects 
  too are likely to have been positive. The cuts in subsidies affect household 
  incomes adversely in direct proportion to their consumption of subsidised goods 
  and services. While some basic foods such as bread were among them, the cuts 
  overwhelmingly concerned energy products whose consumption correlates positively 
  with income. The compensatory transfers are however uniform for everyone and 
  hence the short term impact of the reform on income distribution can only have 
  been egalitarian, although the extent of it is not known since no hard data 
  are available as yet.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>&#133; and some 
  potential lessons</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This basic income 
  experience is in its infancy and it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions 
  and lessons from it. Nonetheless, it may suggest possibilities that could help 
  make basic income more of a realistic proposition in some contexts. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Advocacy for 
  basic income: </i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The adoption of 
  the subsidy reform and the birth of a de facto basic income in Iran owe much 
  to the fact that cash transfers are universally seen as compensation for the 
  loss of subsidies, not as a right or entitlement without a quid pro quo. That 
  is how the hurdle of reciprocity was overcome. The rights-based arguments would 
  have been a non-starter. Furthermore, a basic income was not a policy objective 
  in itself but the fortuitous outcome of a broader effort aimed at correcting 
  an inefficient and inequitable system of subsidies. It served to facilitate 
  subsidy reform by making it more palatable to politicians and the public at 
  large. In a sense, the country stumbled upon basic income while pursuing a different 
  objective. This unique experience highlights the instrumental potential of basic 
  income in smoothing the way towards better resource allocation and greater equality, 
  the two objectives of Iran's reform. The concept's very simplicity appears to 
  account for its emergence in the national search for an appealing alternative 
  to an irrational system of subsidies. It just seemed to make sense. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Financing a 
  basic income: </b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A major hurdle 
  facing a basic income scheme is often finding sufficient resources to fund it. 
  In Iran, the problem was turned on its head: substantial funds were going to 
  be available from price increases but a use for them had to be found. The basic 
  income emerged as a way of using up a large portion of those funds. This method 
  of financing a basic income is not discussed much in the literature but it has 
  its merits. One is that it puts no new claim on existing sources, for example 
  the national budget or oil export revenues. Another is pointed out by Philippe 
  Van Parijs who contrasts Iran's approach with that of Alaska, noting:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In many places, 
    this is a far more realistic option than an Alaska-type permanent fund program&#133;the 
    Alaska scheme is funded out of the interest collected from investments made 
    worldwide with revenues generated by the production of oil at some point in 
    the past, whereas the Iranian scheme should be understood to be funded out 
    of a tax on the current consumption of oil. The Alaska-type scheme is therefore 
    restricted to resource-rich (sub-) countries that manage at some point to 
    exercise sufficient political self-restraint to create and develop a substantial 
    fund. The Iranian-type scheme, by contrast, is available to any country that 
    wants to price the consumption of oil in an ecologically responsible way and 
    to buffer the effect on people's standard of living in a socially responsible 
    way. For this road to basic income to be a real option there is no need to 
    first accumulate a large fund, nor indeed to be an oil-producing or resource-rich 
    country. (Philippe Van Parijs, 'BIEN 2010 Congress: A Brief Personal Account,'<i> 
    BIEN NewsFlash</i> 62, 2010, pp. 2-4. <a href="http://www.basicincome.org/bien/pdf/Flash62.pdf">www.basicincome.org/bien/pdf/Flash62.pdf</a>)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the longer 
  term however, the Alaska model has the advantage of a permanent flow whereas 
  the Iran model does not. Since the subsidies are being cut permanently, one 
  might presume that the compensatory transfers too would continue indefinitely. 
  But this is by no means certain. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>Universal coverage 
  and the transfer amount: </i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the main 
  justifications for universality lies in the shortcomings of targeting, but universal 
  coverage has its cost too when the resources available are exogenously given 
  or &quot;fixed,&quot; as is the case in Iran since the funds available depend 
  on the extent of price hikes and the volume of goods and services sold, not 
  on the scheme's coverage or the transfer amount. The distribution of the funds 
  is thus subject to a trade-off between the number of beneficiaries and the amount 
  of the transfer to each. The universality thus comes at the expense of the lower 
  income people who could have received more had those with higher incomes been 
  excluded. At the time of writing (April 2012), there is increasing evidence 
  that the principle of universality in Iran's scheme may be sacrificed with some 
  better-off households being dropped from the programme. The current plan is 
  to urge higher income earners to opt out of the transfer scheme voluntarily. 
  Households with an income above a couple of thousand dollars a month (a fairly 
  large amount of money in Iran) are being invited to consider giving up their 
  cash subsidy in whole or in part (the options are the entire amount, half the 
  amount or any addition to the transfer amount in the second phase of the programme). 
  No one knows how they will respond. If enough of them agree to withdraw, the 
  matter will have been settled. If not, the government will have to decide how 
  to proceed. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Constituency 
  building: </b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The subsidy reform 
  in Iran was a government initiative that, far from enjoying public support, 
  aroused deep anxiety throughout the society. It was the most radical economic 
  transformation Iranians were going to experience in living memory. The cash 
  transfer component of it was designed in part to alleviate public concern and 
  build support for the reform on the strength of the argument that a large part 
  of the population would in fact receive more in cash subsidy than they would 
  lose from cuts in price subsidies. Universal coverage came about for lack of 
  a practical alternative. It had few advocates per se and may yet prove to be 
  short lived, even if retreating from it may be harder now that it is in place. 
  But even if some of the better-off households are excluded from the transfer 
  scheme, their number is unlikely to be large. The success of the reform depends 
  on the vast majority of the people feeling that they are not being cheated out 
  of their fair share of the oil wealth. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To sum up the potential 
  lessons: </font></p>
<ul>

    on rights may not always be the best political strategy for promoting basic

    nature of the transfers can help overcome objections rooted in the principle

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by Malcolm Torry</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the second issue 
  of the Citizen's Income Newsletter in 2010 we published a research note which 
  employed a Department for Work and Pensions spreadsheet to calculate the effects 
  of establishing a universal and nonwithdrawable benefit on three types of household 
  containing someone employed for at least sixteen hours a week. The universal 
  benefit was created by the simple mechanism of reducing the Tax Credit and Child 
  Tax Credit withdrawal rates to zero. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This article describes 
  further research on the same scheme using EUROMOD: software which employs Family 
  Resources Survey (previously Family Expenditure Survey) data to calculate individuals' 
  gains and losses for members of a full range of households.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The task in 
  2010</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2010 we wanted 
  to test whether it is possible to revise the tax and benefits system in such 
  a way as </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1) to increase 
  employment incentives and make nobody worse off for household gross earnings 
  up to &pound;750 per week for families with children and up to &pound;450 per 
  week for single adults without children;<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2) to reduce administrative 
  complexity considerably by turning Working Tax Credits and Child Tax Credits 
  into nonwithdrawable benefits;<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) and to do it 
  by making as few other changes as possible to the current system.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>The method</i>: 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We took three family 
  types:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">a) Single adult, 
  no children, local authority tenant (working 40 hours per week)<br>
  <br>
  b) Lone parent, two children under 11, local authority tenant (working 16 hours 
  per week)<br>
  <br>
  c) Couple, with two children under 11, private tenant (working 40 hours per 
  week)<br>
  <br>
  We used the spreadsheet employed by the Department for Work and Pensions to 
  construct their Tax Benefit Model tables to calculate net incomes after housing 
  costs for gross earnings between &pound;20 and &pound;1,200 per week for a variety 
  of schemes for each of the household types a) to c) and have compared those 
  net incomes with net incomes under the current system. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The scheme</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The scheme which 
  provided the closest fit with the criteria 1) to 3) above was as follows:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We replaced Working 
  Tax Credits and Child Tax Credits with unconditional and nonwithdrawable benefits 
  of &pound;60 pw for each adult and &pound;31.59 pw for each child (effectively 
  an increase in Child Benefit of &pound;31.59 p.w.). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Income tax was 
  collected on all earned income as follows:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From &pound;0 
    to &pound;20,000 pa, 20%</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From &pound;20,001 
    to &pound;40,000 pa, 35%</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Above &pound;40,000 
    pa, 40%</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We removed the 
  Lower Earnings Limit for National Insurance Contributions, and also the Upper 
  Earnings Limit. This meant that National Insurance Contributions as well as 
  Income Tax was charged on all earned income, not just on that above the Lower 
  Earnings Limit.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We reduced the 
  Housing Benefit taper from 65% to 40%</font></p>

  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The steeper curve 
  resulting from the revised scheme indicated higher employment incentives, particularly 
  for the couple with children. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>EUROMOD</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EUROMOD is a tax-benefit 
  model for the European Union, developed by the Institute for Social and Economic 
  Research at the University of Essex. The UK part of the model, which is similar 
  to the previously-used model POLIMOD, employs Family Resources Survey data to 
  calculate the actual difference in disposable income experienced by individuals 
  when a change is made to the tax and benefits system. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The data is constructed 
  from a survey of 57,276 individuals in the UK, i.e., approximately 0.1% of the 
  population. The most recent data available is from 2008, and the most recent 
  tax and benefit levels and regulations employed by EUROMOD are for 2009 - which 
  is fortunate, because those are the levels and regulations we employed when 
  we used the Department for Work and Pensions spreadsheet to evaluate our 2010 
  scheme. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EUROMOD's output 
  is of two kinds: Disposable incomes for every one of the 57,276 individuals 
  (which can be compared with disposable incomes under the current scheme), and 
  mean disposable incomes for earned income deciles. (In this case disposable 
  income is net income before housing costs. Because all we are evaluating is 
  gains and losses, it isn't too much of a problem that in 2010 we were calculating 
  net income after housing costs, and that now we are calculating net income before 
  housing costs, because absolute levels will be the same; but we need to be aware 
  that if we were able to factor in housing costs - which we aren't - then the 
  percentages mentioned below would be different. Each of our two projects stands 
  up on its own, so in research terms it is no problem that what we have called 
  disposable income in the second project is not the same as net income in the 
  first project.)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Findings</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">EUROMOD simulation 
  shows that the scheme we constructed in 2010 would result in large gains or 
  losses for thousands of individuals. This was not picked up by the 2010 project 
  because for that project we only tested the scheme on three particular household 
  types, whereas the Family Resources Survey covers every conceivable household 
  type and employment pattern. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Adjustments 
  to the scheme</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we have now 
  tested numerous adjustments to the scheme in order to achieve fewer and lower 
  losses. Clearly it was going to cost additional revenue to reduce those in the 
  lower earnings deciles experiencing major losses, and we were going to have 
  to abandon our previous aim of revenue neutrality: so we set a limit of &pound;3bn 
  of additional expenditure per annum. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The scheme which 
  fitted these criteria is as follows:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Working Tax Credits 
  and Child Tax Credits are still replaced with unconditional and nonwithdrawable 
  benefits of &pound;60 pw for each adult and &pound;31.59 pw for each child (effectively 
  an increase in Child Benefit of &pound;31.59 p.w.). (The couple element is also 
  set at &pound;60 per week, which ensures that in a couple each of the two individuals 
  receives an unconditional benefit. In this project we were also able to decide 
  to leave all other Tax Credit levels, for instance, for disability, as they 
  are, and to make them nonwithdrawable too.)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Income tax is collected 
  on all earned income above a Personal Tax Allowance of &pound;4,000 pa (rather 
  than on all earned income) as follows:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From &pound;4,001 
    to &pound;20,000 pa, 25% (rather than at 20%)</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From &pound;20,001 
    to &pound;40,000 pa, 35%</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Above &pound;40,000 
    pa, 45% (rather than 40%)</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We retain the Lower 
  Earnings Limit for National Insurance Contributions (rather than removing it), 
  and we remove the Upper Earnings Limit, as before.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We reduce the Housing 
  Benefit taper from 65% to 40%.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The results</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The mean of disposable 
  incomes for the new scheme is never more than 3% below the mean of disposable 
  incomes for the current scheme for any income decile. Mean disposable incomes 
  in the first three deciles are very close to previous levels. In the fourth 
  decile the mean is 3% above the previous level, and in the fifth 4%, and in 
  the sixth 7%. This pattern is a direct result of the non-withdrawal of Tax Credits, 
  and represents the kind of employment incentive we're looking for amongst mid-range 
  earners. (This result tells us nothing about individual households because on 
  a change in disposable incomes many households will be sorted into different 
  deciles, but it does give some guide as to how much redistribution is going 
  on). </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some gains and

  to discover the aggregate losses suffered by individual households.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The difference 
  between the sum of monthly gains and the sum of monthly losses is a positive 
  &pound;173,603, which means that for these 57,276 individuals an additional

  the additional cost of the adjusted scheme will be approximately &pound;2bnper 
  annum. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Discussion</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By making some 
  simple changes to our current tax and benefits scheme we have achieved an unconditional 
  and nonwithdrawable benefit for every individual in a household currently containing 
  someone receiving Tax Credits. The steeper gains in disposable income as earned 
  incomes rise will mean lower employment disincentives; and turning Tax Credits 
  into nonwithdrawable benefits will save considerable sums in administration, 
  which should pay for much of the additional &pound;2bn of expenditure per annum. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It will be a political 
  decision as to whether anything should be done to ameliorate the losses of those 
  very high earners who will lose over 15% on the implementation of the scheme. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A question remains 
  over the 8.7% of the population who will experience losses of between 10% and 
  15%. These are almost all in the earnings mid-range, and most will currently 
  be receiving withdrawable Tax Credits and suffering substantial marginal deduction 
  rates. Under the revised scheme they will experience lower marginal deduction 
  rates. The fact that marginal deduction rates will be lower than before will 
  mean that additional earnings will translate more easily into additional disposable 
  incomes. Many of these households will currently be suffering from the problem 
  that it is not worth the partner of someone in full-time employment seeking 
  part-time employment because they will achieve almost no additional disposable 
  income for the household. Under the revised scheme no such penalty will apply, 
  and all additional earned income will translate into additional disposable income 
  for the household. Now that we have applied a &pound;4,000 Personal Tax Allowance 
  in addition to the &pound;60 per week benefit, part-time earnings will be particularly 
  significant for household budgets. It should therefore be relatively easy for 
  the relevant households to repair the loss relating to the revised scheme, and 
  then to go on adding to their earned income and therefore to their disposable 
  income.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At the moment, 
  those in employment for too few hours for receipt of Tax Credits, or who are 
  receiving Income Support or Jobseekers' Allowance and earning small sums, might 
  be amongst those suffering losses under our revised scheme because they won't 
  be receiving Tax Credits and so won't receive their nonwithdrawable replacement, 
  but they will be experiencing a lower personal allowance and increased initial 
  Income Tax rate. This problem will disappear when Universal Credit is implemented 
  from 2013 onwards, because then out-of-work and in-work benefits will be combined 
  and we shall be able to run a similar project to calculate the simple changes 
  required to establish an unconditional and nonwithdrawable benefit for every 
  UK citizen. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In September the 
  <b>National Audit Office </b>published a report on Means testing: 'It is clear 
  that means testing will be used extensively for the foreseeable future as it 
  helps target state support at the people that need it most, but it can have 
  many other important consequences. For example, there can be disincentives for 
  recipients of means-tested benefits to return to work. Means testing also makes 
  the administration of benefits more complex and is associated with higher costs 
  as well as increased rates of fraud and error. In light of proposed and ongoing 
  reforms to benefits and related programmes, the National Audit Office notes 
  the importance of departments sharing good practice and learning from past experiences 
  in the design of means tests. For example, HM Revenue and Customs has struggled 
  in the past with unexpectedly large overpayments of tax credits (&pound;9 billion 
  between 2003-04 and 2009-10) because of the way that payments are determined 
  under the legislation. In spite of changes to the design of tax credits, overpayments 
  continue to be significant. Departments do not systematically consider or measure 
  all of the impacts of means testing: for example, the burden on claimants, such 
  as difficulty with completing forms and the cost of requesting advice. Issues 
  associated with means testing, such as incorrect declarations of earnings and 
  errors by officials in calculating entitlements, accounted for over half of 
  all fraud and error in benefits and tax credits. There is a lack of coordination 
  of, and overall accountability for, means testing across government. Departments 
  are responsible for their own means-tested benefits and their impacts, but because 
  means-tested benefits interact with each other it is important that there is 
  coordination. For example, no one body has responsibility for looking at how 
  the impact of university fees will be influenced by wider means testing. This 
  is important as some households could be financially worse off if they work 
  more and their child is no longer eligible for a bursary to help towards tuition 
  fees.' <a href="http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/1012/means_testing.aspx">www.nao.org.uk/publications/1012/means_testing.aspx</a>.

  Exclusion in the EU</i> . 'According to Europe 2020 targets risk of exclusion 
  should be measured by three indicators: at-risk-of-poverty, severe material 
  deprivation and living in households with very low work intensity. &#133; In 
  the first group, with Hungary, Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, countries tend 
  to be characterized by high rates of (severe) material deprivation and poverty 
  risk (12-21% and 12-26%, respectively). Hungary is somewhat distinct from the 
  other three countries (which are actually geographical neighbours), with a relatively 
  worse work intensity and material deprivation indicators and somewhat better 
  poverty risk measure than the others. The second &quot;resource-poor&quot; cluster, 
  with Bulgaria and Romania, suffers from an extremely high extent of (severe) 
  material deprivation (27-37%). The third cluster of &quot;better than average&quot; 
  countries includes a large number of heterogeneous countries, which perform 
  above the EU average in most indicators. The fourth group, with Germany, the 
  UK, Ireland and Belgium, is characterized by an above-average share of low work 
  intensity rates (12-24%), below average share of people suffering from severe 
  material deprivation (3-6%), and at-risk-of-poverty rates around the EU average 
  (see Table 1). The weakness of these countries is low work intensity: in order 
  words, a high share of people lives in jobless households or in households with 
  little labour market engagement. In contrast to this &quot;work-poor&quot; group, 
  there are two &quot;resource-poor&quot; country groups' (pp.1, 4). <a href="http://www.euro.centre.org/data/1327061559_78123.pdf">www.euro.centre.org/data/1327061559_78123.pdf</a></font></p>

  Brussels, 26-27 April 2012</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by Anne Miller</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More than fifty 
  delegates, of all ages and from sixteen countries, gathered at the European 
  Parliament in Brussels on the 26th and 27th April 2012 to discuss an exciting 
  new venture: a European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) entitled 'Unconditional Basic 
  Income' (UBI). This was the inspiration of Klaus Sambor from Austria. Together 
  with a group of people who met in Vienna in October 2011, he put together a 
  text in English which was circulated to interested parties for comment prior 
  to the Brussels meeting. This initiative has been possible because </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">on April 1, 2012 
  a new participatory tool was born: the European Citizens' Initiative. From now 
  on, we - the citizens of the European Union - have the same right as a majority 
  in the European Parliament and the Member States: to contribute to setting the 
  political agenda for the whole continent. (The European Citizens' Initiative 
  Pocket Guide, by Bruno Kaufmann, published by the Green European Foundation, 
  March 2012, <a href="http://www.gef.eu/">www.gef.eu</a>.) </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The purpose of 
  the meeting in Brussels was to agree the text of the 'Unconditional Basic Income' 
  paper for the introduction of an ECI into the Parliament, asking the EU to speed 
  up the introduction of a UBI. The paper comprised a short section that introduced 
  the topic of a UBI, setting out the objectives and defining what was meant by 
  a UBI. The major part was taken up by referring to Articles in various pieces 
  of legislation, including the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning 
  of the European Union, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European 
  Union, March 2010. The introduction of a UBI would help the Parliament to fulfil 
  its obligations under each of the specified Articles.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The meeting was 
  hosted in the European Parliament by Gerald H&auml;fner, MEP for the Green Party 
  in Germany, who welcomed the delegates on the Thursday afternoon. Then Werner 
  R&auml;tz, also from Germany, led an interesting debate on the social context 
  for the introduction of both an ECI and the UBI: changing employment patterns 
  and inadequate income maintenance systems, which had led to widespread poverty, 
  and to increasing inequality between rich and poor. Participants deplored the 
  punitive and controlling nature of the various social security systems within 
  the EU. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Klaus Sambor then 
  went over the first definitive part of the document, giving the purposes for, 
  and definition of, the UBI, indicating why certain wordings had been chosen. 
  'The emancipatory &quot;Unconditional Basic Income&quot; is defined by the following 
  four criteria: universal, individual, unconditional, and high enough to ensure 
  an existence in dignity and participation in society.' He said that the UBI 
  does not replace the welfare state, but completes it and transforms it from 
  a compensatory into an emancipatory one. He explained that only the four criteria 
  for the UBI would be specified, and not any particular means of funding it at 
  this stage. He felt that it was important to get the idea of the UBI accepted 
  first, and to fight the sources-of-funding battle later. It was recognised that 
  it would be up to each member state to work out its particular means of implementing 
  its own scheme, but that the EU would probably have to be involved directly 
  to some extent.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The initial explanation 
  was followed by the first of the two purposes of the conference, which was to 
  discuss the subject matter and objectives of the document. Part of the discussion 
  revolved around the question as to whether one should change the definition 
  of the UBI in order to increase the chance of its being adopted. However, it 
  was agreed that some things were inviolable, such as the unconditional nature 
  of the UBI. Even then, because its presence would alienate the Trade Unions, 
  some recommended the removal of the clause which referred to there being no 
  obligation to work (inserted to illustrate the unconditional nature of the UBI). 
  The discussion went on past its allotted time of six o'clock, after which the 
  delegates were invited to a drinks reception beside an exhibition comprising 
  photographs and other documents from Ojivero-Omitara in Namibia, showing the 
  tremendously beneficial lasting effects of the Basic Income experiment conducted 
  during 2008 and 2009. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the evening 
  some modest changes were made to the document. The following morning, the company 
  reassembled in order to approve the final draft of the ECI. Some further discussion 
  took place about the wording of the 'universality' criterion, with respect to 
  who should be eligible, whether the 'European citizen' (with its legal connotations), 
  or a 'member', 'inhabitant', 'legal resident' or just 'resident' of the European 
  Union. In the end, those present voted to refer to the UBI as a human right, 
  without specifying the population, again leaving that battle for a later date.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the end, the 
  clause about there being 'no obligation to work' as an example of the 'unconditionality' 
  criterion remained, even though members of the Italian basic income network, 
  Bin Italia, were very pessimistic, feeling that it would make it almost impossible 
  to achieve any success in Italy, because of the antipathy from the Trade Unions.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During these sometimes 
  fierce debates, I was reminded of the Basic Income Research Group / Citizen's 
  Income Trust early discussions. After the relief of meeting some other basic 
  income enthusiasts in 1983, I was surprised to discover how hotly we debated 
  the finer details of our favourite schemes. Back then, as in Brussels, it took 
  us some time to work out what our objectives were, and what was the instrument. 
  Did we want a BI for its own sake, or because it fulfilled certain objectives? 
  We noted that some good unintended consequences would follow, so should these 
  also be listed with the objectives? We had to learn how to prioritise objectives. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bin Italia had 
  provided an alternative version of the ECI document, the purpose of which was 
  to ensure that the group followed the procedures set out for the introduction 
  of an ECI closely. They were in favour of having less precise definitions of 
  a UBI, so that the EU would have less reason to reject the idea out of hand 
  as inadmissible, and also to appeal to a wider set of interest groups, thus 
  widening participation. Some of their ideas were adopted and were put into the 
  final draft, but Bin Italia felt strongly that there should have been a proposal 
  to vote for either their version or the previous one, but this did not happen.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the end, compromise 
  has to be reached because one cannot please everyone. I myself would have preferred 
  a slightly different definition of the UBI, which would have emphasised that 
  it was not means-tested, and that it was not just assessed on an individual 
  basis, but also delivered to each adult recipient on an individual basis too. 
  I would also have liked non-selectivity to be introduced as a concept, where 
  the amounts that are received are not based on different characteristics, such 
  as gender, age, marital status or household composition, to distinguish it from 
  the unconditionality concept, where the right to the UBI would not depend on 
  preconditions being met.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second main 
  purpose of the conference was to draw up the outline of a Campaign for the ECI. 
  This requires obtaining the signatures of one million (1,000,000) EU citizens, 
  out of its five hundred million inhabitants, either through a website, or by 
  the usual signed petition, within a period of one year. A Citizens Committee 
  was set up, comprising an organiser (together with at least two substitutes 
  in case the need should arise) from each country present, to help to organise 
  the campaign. The task is to specify some succinct wording on the petition, 
  and to obtain legal advice to make sure that the wording and process of the 
  ECI conforms to EU legislation: otherwise the Parliament could reject the ECI 
  out of hand. Gerald H&auml;fner was very helpful in giving some overall guidance 
  about how to present an ECI to the Parliament, and he suggested strategies. 
  Klaus Sambor and Ronald Blaschke (who had also been closely involved in the 
  development of the ECI document) were voted as Chair and Vice Chair of the committee 
  respectively. It was agreed that the first meeting of the committee will be 
  held on the 7th and 8th July in Paris. It is hoped that the preparatory arrangements 
  will be made in time for the Campaign to be launched on the afternoon of Sunday 
  the 16th September, the last day of the 14th BIEN Congress, to be held near 
  Munich, Germany.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am left feeling 
  excited about this new enterprise, but also feeling rather humble as, so often 
  on the continent, all those around could communicate in many languages, while 
  I could merely offer my one and only. I am also left with a warm glow of having 
  been with a group of friendly people, who all believe that 'human beings are 
  more important than the economy'.<br>

  Fitzpatrick, <i>Welfare Theory: An introduction to the theoretical debates in

  2nd edition, Palgrave Macmillan, 2011, xvi + 241 pp, pbk 0 230 27202 6, &pound;19.99</font></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The map with 
    which political philosophers and social theorists are concerned overlaps, 
    to a considerable extent, with the particular territory occupied by social 
    policy. This book starts from the premise that you cannot properly understand 
    the one unless you understand the other. (p.xiv)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This accessible 
  and thoroughly researched book is also a vindication of Fitzpatrick's conviction 
  that 'welfare theory' - the philosophy of social policy - is a discipline in 
  its own right. Welfare theory draws on both 'social theory (the philosophy of 
  sociology and social science) and political theory (the philosophy of politics 
  and government)' (p.xv), but it orders things in its own way and develops its 
  own emphases. It is not insignificant that the first chapter is entitled 'wellbeing', 
  now a focal concept for welfare theorists and social policy makers. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The book is structured 
  around a number of concepts: equality, liberty, citizenship, community, state, 
  power, poverty, society, and class. Fitzpatrick explores the histories of these 
  ideas, the different ways in which they have been understood, and 'recent developments'. 
  Throughout, there is reference to social policy. For instance: the National 
  Health Service's achievements are judged against a variety of definitions of 
  equality (p.39), the distribution and redistribution of income is the field 
  on which a discussion of the relationship between equality and liberty is constructed 
  (ch.3), new forms of 'deliberative democracy' are related to the idea of 'democracy' 
  (p.79), and the chapter on 'state, power and poverty' is largely driven by the 
  history and current state of the UK's welfare state, the detail of current social 
  policy, and measured outcomes (ch.5). The first three of these relationships 
  fit the three types of relationship which Fitzpatrick lists in his introduction: 
  'assessment' (of practice by theory), 'explanation' (of practice by theory), 
  and 'reform' (of practice by theory). But we can see that there is also a fourth 
  relationship: practical policy's influence on welfare and its concepts. To take 
  a particular example: Beveridge's 'contributory' and 'social assistance' welfare 
  state was largely driven by previous government-supported co-operative insurance 
  provision and by the Elizabethan Poor Law. The real-world relationship between 
  welfare theory and social policy is a circular one, with each affecting the 
  other. Fitzpatrick's book is a text-book for students ( - the first edition 
  was written for that purpose, and this second edition has benefited from the 
  first edition's use for that purpose), so we would expect it to concentrate 
  on the 'welfare theory forms social policy' side of the relationship; but in 
  his 'concluding remarks' Fitzpatrick suggests that </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">it is often necessary 
    to take social policy themes and issues into account when discussing social 
    and political theory. Social policy students do not simply debate how to translate 
    principles into practical reality. Instead, they ask distinctive questions 
    that enhance the method and assumptions of social philosophy. To explore social 
    and political thought without substantial reference to the battles fought 
    over social policies is to miss a key feature in the development of modern 
    societies. (p.211). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following the chapters 
  on particular concepts, chapter 7 is entitled 'ideologies'. Here Fitzpatrick 
  describes the Radical Right, Conservatism, Social Democracy, Marxism, and Feminism. 
  (Descriptions of the first two and of Marxism are followed by 'criticisms'; 
  descriptions of social democracy and of feminism are not.) </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chapter 8 is on 
  'identities': a recognition that social policy is often driven by the 'recognition' 
  of an 'identity' (for instance, disability). Chapter 9 is on 'globalization', 
  and shows how a global economy constrains national social policy; and this chapter 
  in particular shows how economic policy has influenced both the idea of globalization 
  and changes in social policy. The final chapter, on 'global justice and environmentalism', 
  is new to this edition, and contains a useful taxonomy of types of global justice. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, Fitzpatrick 
  suggests that the utopian and the pragmatist need each other. The truth of this 
  in relation to our tax and benefits system is obvious. Maybe it's time for a 
  second edition of his Freedom and Security, his book about a Citizen's Income: 
  a book which exemplifies the complex relationship between welfare theory and 
  social policy which the book under review is all about. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whilst in all of 
  the countries studied in this edited collection the welfare state can be regarded 
  as entering a new age of austerity, the picture that emerges is one of diversity: 
  of different kinds of financial crisis in different countries, of different 
  cultural contexts, and of different effects on welfare provision. For instance: 
  'Liberal market economies ... are least well equipped in both economic buffers 
  and social solidarity to deal with the impact of a crisis in welfare funding 
  because interests are not shared corporately or between social classes' (p.24).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first part 
  of the book tackles more general questions. Has the crisis resulted in a shift 
  in the economic paradigm? No: that would require positive action. Has a crisis 
  in financialised capitalism fostered a new economic and social strategy? No: 
  it has resulted in welfare state retrenchment and widening inequality. Are we 
  all in this together? No: there is one strategy for financial institutions, 
  and another for citizens. Is a global social floor a good idea? It's a better 
  idea than national safety nets. How will relatively young welfare states in 
  the developing world cope with the financial crisis? In Brazil and South Africa, 
  the crisis has led to the expansion of income transfer programmes, and in particular 
  to the inclusion of 16 and 17 year olds (p.104).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second half 
  of the book studies individual countries. South Korea's experience of the 1997 
  crisis suggests that extreme neoliberalism doesn't work. China's response to 
  the recent crisis has been to include previously excluded groups in welfare 
  systems. Germany's small financial sector, and adjustments already made during 
  unification, have meant that the crisis has had a 'muted' effect. Ireland's 
  weak welfare state is suffering retrenchment rather than reform. Iceland's crisis 
  has seen the neoliberal model questioned. In Scandinavia unemployment has risen, 
  but only slowly. Domestic policy concerns drove the United States' healthcare 
  reforms, and in neither the United States nor in Canada has the crisis resulted 
  in much welfare state reform. In the UK, the depth of austerity measures is 
  more ideological than necessary. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">'More of the same' 
  is the picture that emerges: that is, it is long term cultural and ideological 
  factors that determine welfare structures. Whilst the financial crisis might 
  have precipitated minor change, and in some cases it has exacerbated existing 
  trends (especially in the UK and Ireland, and over the extent of punitive measures 
  imposed on the unemployed), it has stimulated little genuine reform. The editors' 
  concluding chapter extracts a number of 'solutions' from the different chapters, 
  but they can't be said to constitute any kind of package; and their confident 
  conclusion that</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What the contributions 
    here demonstrate is not only that emergency events are crucial to both the 
    shaping of social policy, and to the understanding of that process, but also 
    that challenging times are as likely to widen the scope for progressive welfare 
    state-building as they are to diminish it, and that how states respond is 
    a matter of political struggle and political choice (p.278)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">isn't borne out 
  by the evidence. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The strengths of 
  the book are the amount of detailed evidence and the careful analysis in each 
  of the very different chapters; and a particular strength is that the chapter 
  authors don't draw clear conclusions where there are none to be drawn. A justifiable 
  clear conclusion is Farnsworth's: that Government policy is bound to increase 
  inequality in the UK. What he might also have said is that reduced withdrawal 
  rates under the new Universal Credit will reduce inequality and will incentivise 
  labour market activity. The lesson to draw is that reduced benefits withdrawal 
  rates and an increase in universal benefits would both reduce inequality and 
  incentivise labour market activity: both outcomes which would enhance the economic 
  outlook and the social fabric.</font></p>

  of minimum income protection in Europe</i></b></font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
  Policy Press, 2011, xi + 271 pp, hbk, 1 847 42725 0, &pound;70</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This thoroughly 
  researched survey of European means-tested minimum income protection (MIP) systems 
  - the safety-nets into which households and individuals fall if other earned 
  or benefits income is insufficient - will quickly become an essential research 
  tool for anyone interested in social policy generally and in income maintenance 
  in particular. The more precarious nature of both families and employment has 
  made means-tested safety nets more significant for increasing numbers of citizens, 
  which means that means-tested systems will become more politically important 
  (and this, in turn, is one of the factors that has led to Iain Duncan Smith's 
  success with Universal Credit). Greater political importance will mean more 
  social policy debate, more need for research, and more need for books such as 
  this one.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first part 
  of the book contains introductory material on defining MIP (as means-tested, 
  and as raising total income to a social minimum), measuring minimum income protection, 
  the datasets used, problems of comparability, and welfare state contexts (including 
  social insurance and other non-MIP benefits).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The central section 
  contains country analyses. For each of seventeen European countries, the welfare 
  state context is discussed, MIP systems are described, and current issues and 
  reforms get a mention. The section on the UK reveals the extent to which our 
  social policy is dominated by MIP, and also the reason: the inadequacy of social 
  insurance provision. The chapter describes the UK's MIP benefits in detail (including 
  Tax Credits), and suggests that 'MIP in the UK continues to play a strong and 
  exceptional role by international standards' (p.152).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The third section 
  of the book compares the MIP systems of the seventeen countries in terms of 
  benefit levels (for both individuals and households), and in terms of benefits 
  levels' ability to keep up with the cost of living - and here the author finds 
  no clear correlation between adequacy of benefits and the country groupings 
  developed in relation to other aspects of the analysis. Further sections compare 
  numbers of MIP recipients, how recipients are distributed across demographic 
  groups, ways in which different schemes serve different categories of recipient, 
  whether or not reliance of MIP is increasing, and expenditure levels. When the 
  authors cluster MIP systems on the basis of the material in this section, the 
  UK finds itself with Spain and Portugal: 'relatively low benefit levels but 
  generous treatment of families in comparison with the benefit rates for single 
  persons ... indicating that principles of need and desert have priority over 
  equality' (pp.221, 228).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The authors conclude: 
  'In most countries, the last safety net fails to lift persons out of poverty. 
  Europe, which is proud of its social model, containing strong social cohesion 
  and comprehensive social protection, has so far failed to institute a viable 
  and effective last safety net for all of its citizens' (p.233). A final section 
  studies the effect of the recent financial crisis on Europe's MIP systems, and, 
  in relation to the UK, the authors note a large increase in the number of MIP 
  recipients, 'confirming the high structural importance of needs-based benefits 
  ... and the low availability of other (better) forms of social protection' (p.236). 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That 'better' is 
  a welcome but rare value judgement. Introductory material on different kinds 
  of benefits system locates MIP within different countries' social insurance 
  and other benefits systems, but what the book lacks is a structured evaluation 
  of the advantages and disadvantages of means-tested safety nets and of other 
  benefit types. Universal benefits are not discussed as a category, and the UK's 
  Child Benefit doesn't get a mention.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some recent developments 
  clearly came too late for inclusion. The Government's recent consultation on 
  a more adequate single tier state pension answers to some extent the book's 
  criticism that in the UK 'basic pensions are too low to secure a decent livelihood 
  in old age' (p.49); and Universal Credit will be a considerable improvement 
  on the present patchwork of means-tested benefits. Unfortunately, the book's 
  analysis wouldn't have picked this up because it doesn't compare the benefits 
  withdrawal rates of different countries' systems. This is an important omission. 
  An MIP system with a withdrawal rate of 95% of additional earned income is a 
  very different animal from one with a withdrawal rate of 50%. Also lacking is 
  any discussion of the labour market disincentives that means-tested systems 
  create and of the surveillance systems that inevitably accompany household-based 
  benefits systems.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We really ought 
  to have a second volume from these authors, containing a comparison of MIP systems 
  in relation to such characteristics as withdrawal rates and earnings disregards, 
  and a comparison of different benefits types in terms of their social and economic 
  effects. Such a volume would be a major contribution to debate on welfare state 
  reform. These authors are clearly capable of it, and I look forward to reading 
  it. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As Bent Greve writes 
  in his introduction to this highly topical edition of <i>Social Policy and Administration</i>, 
  the financial crisis which began in 2008 has given rise to 'a new era of welfare 
  states &#133; where targeting and emphasis on work are more substantial than 
  earlier' (p.333). Cuts in welfare budgets mean lower and more restricted benefits 
  and higher retirement ages. The aim is now to save money rather than to improve 
  services.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two articles show 
  that the financial crisis has generated policy changes consistent with long-term 
  policy tendencies; another that initial Keynesian responses are giving way to 
  retrenchment; and another that governments have in fact <i>not</i> taken advantage 
  of the crisis to bring about otherwise unachievable policy changes. Two articles 
  show that it is political rather than economic factors which have generated 
  welfare state reforms. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The overall impression 
  is one of intensification of existing welfare state styles but with additional 
  tendencies towards retrenchment and 'targeting' - the latter unfortunately understood 
  as means-testing rather than as increasing the coverage and levels of universal 
  benefits in the context of progressive tax systems.</font></p>

  A. Searle, <i>Well-being: In search of a good life</i></b></font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
  Policy Press, 2008, ix + 198 pp, hbk 1 86134 887 6, &pound;65</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this thorough 
  and very readable book Beverley Searle employs extensive panel survey data to 
  study people's subjective well-being and the economic and material contexts 
  of their lives. A complex picture emerges. As we would expect, someone's health 
  influences their subjective well-being; interestingly, people over 55 tend to 
  report higher subjective well-being than those under 55; and having and changing 
  social relationships can affect subjective well-being in a variety of ways. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An important finding 
  is that objective wealth and income measurements do not correlate simply with 
  subjective well-being. An improvement in one's financial situation might result 
  in a brief increase in subjective well-being, but the effect will soon wear 
  off. (If our incomes rise then we habituate ourselves to new life circumstances 
  and these might or might not improve our subjective well-being.) What <i>does</i> 
  seem to be significant is<i> subjective</i> wealth, i.e., how we see our wealth 
  in relation to the wealth of those around us. The high subjective well-being 
  experienced by men in social class III (manual) is a surprising and interesting 
  finding. A possible reason is that men in this social class are more accepting 
  of their social and economic circumstances than are men in so-called higher 
  social classes, and that there is something inherently satisfying about the 
  social and economic circumstances of skilled manual workers who work within 
  a set of rules without exercising significant authority within the organisations 
  for which they work. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The situation is 
  of course complicated by the facts that employment status and type of employment 
  influence subjective well-being and that they have a complex relationship with 
  income and wealth. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The author quite 
  rightly calls for more research on inequality and its effects, particularly 
  because 'feelings of exclusion and subjective deprivation operate at all levels 
  of affluence' (p.112). This means that 'a social thesis of well-being' (p.113) 
  might be the way forward: a theory in which 'the &quot;subjective&quot; element 
  of well-being is determined as much by social and political systems and how 
  they interact as by individual effort and striving' (p.113).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the light of 
  this suggestion, Searle addresses housing, education, and employment. In relation 
  to employment she identifies secure employment as fostering subjective well-being, 
  and the UK's long hours culture as being detrimental to it; and she recommends 
  a Citizen's Income as a means of rebalancing employment with the rest of life 
  and as a way of recognising the value of voluntary activity (p.124).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a most 
  useful book. It contains thorough treatments of methodology, innovative and 
  clear representations of results, and intelligent discussion. (It's a pity that 
  the index is somewhat skimpy.)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The final paragraph 
  sums up the message:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hierarchical 
    structure embedded in an economic idea of well-being is unable to embrace 
    the rediscovery of the social welfare approach that is being adopted in some 
    sectors of society &#133; Subjective well-being is not an individual but a 
    collective experience - as such, while everyone should have the right to experience 
    high levels of well-being there should also be a shared, collective responsibility 
    for the well-being of others. &#133; The quest, then, may not be to raise 
    happiness levels but to seek a more sustainable emotion - that of contentment,

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This well-organised 
  book is what it says it is: an 'introduction' to the 'design, management, operation 
  and delivery of benefits' (p.ix). Its careful structure enables Spicker to bring 
  a sense of order to a system which he recognises to be 'baffling' (p.x), though 
  he himself admits that 'there is a limit to how clear it is possible to make 
  things clear - the structure of benefits does not make sense' (p.x). A further 
  problem identified is the constant and rapid change from which the system suffers, 
  and this reviewer can empathise with Spicker's statement that his 'head is cluttered 
  with old rules and regulations dating back through the last thirty-five years' 
  (p.xi).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first part 
  of the book asks 'What is social security?' and suggests that 'there is much 
  more to social security than the relief of poverty' (p.10). The second part 
  details the development of the system from the Poor Law to the present day, 
  and asks whether the new Universal Credit will in practice be a unified benefit. 
  The third part discusses different categories of benefits (National Insurance, 
  means-tested, non-contributory, discretionary, and universal), how claims are 
  processed, and take-up levels. Part IV debates life's contingencies (retirement, 
  illness, disability, children, parenthood, lone parenthood, unemployment, and 
  poverty); and the fifth covers such issues as cost, targeting, fraud, the meaning 
  and measurement of poverty, and redistribution. A final chapter compares Britain's 
  system with those of other countries. A particularly interesting chapter is 
  that on complexity in which Spicker concludes that complexity matters when it 
  leads to the system 'failing to respond to the changing conditions of people 
  in complex circumstances &#133; We cannot ask claimants to live simpler, more 
  orderly lives'. Part of the answer is to address the issues of 'conditionality, 
  administrative rules and administrative procedures' (p.145).</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chapter 12 on 'Universal 
  benefits' starts with an argument as simple as the benefits themselves:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The general arguments 
    for universality &#133; include basic rights, simplicity and effectiveness. 
    The central criticism of universal benefits is that they spread resources 
    too widely: if benefits are going to everyone, then either they will be very 
    costly, or they will have to be set at very low levels. This dilemma can be 
    avoided. One option is that universal benefits can be reclaimed through the 
    tax system - a process referred to as 'clawback'. This has an effect similar 
    to means testing, with two important differences: first, that everyone receives 
    the benefit, and second, that the examination of means is also done for everyone.

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then follow a history 
  and discussion of Child Benefit, a description of New Zealand's universal pension, 
  and a discussion of the Coalition Government's current consideration of a citizen's 
  pension for the UK. The chapter concludes with an intelligent and nuanced debate 
  of a Citizen's Income and with another encomium to Child Benefit:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What Child Benefit 
    offers is a modest but secure element of a family's general income, something 
    that is fairly predictable and secure. It is the only element of income that 
    seems to continue to function reliably in situations where people are moving 
    in and out of work or where their income is unstable and unpredictable. That 
    seems to me something which is valuable and important, and the principle could 
    be more generally extended. (p.124).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In his concluding 
  'Postscript: Social Security: a programme for reform', Spicker's first recommendation 
  is: 'extending the scope and value of less conditional benefits, like Child 
  Benefit, which also helps to stabilise the income during transitions' (p.274); 
  and the first suggestion in a list of ideas for 'reducing complexity, error 
  and administrative confusion' is 'replacing some claims with automatic payments' 
  (p.274). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Spicker doesn't 
  put it like this, but it would be perfectly fair to describe his book as a sustained 
  argument for a partial Citizen's Income.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a name="Room"></a><b>Graham 
  Room, Complexity, <i>Institutions and Public Policy: Agile decision-making in 
  a turbulent world</i></b></font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
  Edward Elgar, 2011, vii + 383pp, hbk, 0 85793 263 1, &pound;95</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is one of 
  those rare books which studies the deeper foundations of theory and practice: 
  not just a particular social policy field, and not even the way in which social 
  policy is either made or studied, but rather the nature of the world in which 
  social policy is made - its institutional, social, and personal realities, and 
  the dynamic relationships between them - and the ways in which social policy-making 
  should therefore be carried out. As Room puts the questions which he asks himself: 
  </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How can we best 
    conceptualise [the] dynamic processes of socio-economic change? &#133; how 
    can we model these dynamics empirically, as processes that are endogenous 
    rather than merely the response to exogenous shocks? &#133; what analytical 
    tools &#133; can be made available to policy-makers for the purpose of monitoring 
    and steering these processes of transformation? (pp.4-5).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In answer to these 
  questions the book discusses the policy process as a non-linear one which </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">involves feedback 
    loops which bring into play a variety of actors who set about reshaping the 
    policy intervention in light of their own strategic objectives &#133; This 
    is policy-making played out on a bouncy castle &#133; Any policy is an intervention 
    in a tangled web of institutions that have developed incrementally over extended 
    periods of time and that give each policy context its own specificity. &#133; 
    Policy terrains and policy effects are path dependent. (p.7)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So policy processes 
  can be both non-linear (containing feed-back loops) and path-dependent ( - their 
  history determines to some extent where they go next), and it is in this complex 
  context, which is also a highly turbulent one, that evidence-based policy decisions 
  have to be made.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first part 
  of the book is theoretical, and Room draws on numerous disciplines to build 
  a conceptual structure. He employs biological and mathematical sciences to understand 
  the economy as a complex adaptive system which is nowhere near to equilibrium; 
  and sociology and political science to understand institutions as diverse and 
  dynamic moral communities subject to change by institutional entrepreneurs when 
  public dissatisfaction opens up new political possibilities. A final theoretical 
  chapter employs biological science to understand the agile agents who operate 
  in far from equilibrium complex systems. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second part 
  of the book relates the first part's conceptual structures to the empirical 
  social scientific methods familiar to students of social policy. Room applies 
  the mathematics of complexity, chaos, and emergent order, to combinations of 
  complex social systems and networks, and then to social mobility and inequality. 
  He finds that </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">egalitarian efforts 
    by the state do not reverse inequalities so much as mute their harshness &#133; 
    As structural change alters the landscape of positional competition, it is 
    &#133; in general those who are already advantaged who are best placed to 
    take advantage of the new opportunities and to avoid the new insecurities 
    (pp.209-210). </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Part 3 employs 
  the understanding of the policy context outlined in part 1, and the methods 
  discussed in part 2, to understand the policy-maker as a 'tuner', an energiser, 
  and a steward, and to discuss particular policy areas. Of particular interest 
  to readers of this Newsletter might be the chapter on poverty and social exclusion, 
  which employs mathematical modelling to understand social polarisation, understands 
  households as agile institutional entrepreneurs negotiating their way around 
  the social policy landscape (of education, benefits, employment, etc.), and 
  recognises that in the employment market 'agile creativity accrues disproportionately 
  to the advantaged' (p.265). </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After chapters 
  on the knowledge economy and the current financial crisis, the final chapter 
  offers a policy tool-kit for agile policy-makers, and examples of how the tools 
  might be used. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is a most 
  fascinating book. Just as Aristotle wrote his <i>Metaphysics</i> ('after-physics') 
  after his<i> Physics</i>, so Room has written a 'metasocialpolicy' which will 
  act as a groundwork for future study of social policy and for policy-making. 
  But perhaps we also need another layer of analysis. The book is about the evolution 
  of complex adaptive systems, but the first chapter mentions a different kind 
  of change: the earthquake - a sudden shifting of the tectonic plates. Scientific 
  progress is mainly evolutionary in character, but occasionally there is a paradigm 
  shift: the emergence of a new way of seeing, a shift in the conceptual tectonic 
  plates. Our welfare state, in most of its aspects, is still fashioned for modernity: 
  for a stable industrial nuclear-family society; but our world is less and less 
  like that. Social reality is now 'liquid' (Zygmunt Bauman), but we are still 
  waiting for the social policy earthquake which will deliver the necessary social 
  infrastructure. It is the science of paradigm change that we require, and a 
  new vision of social policy which will both serve and generate further liquid 
  social reality. Strange though it might seem, the dynamic complexity of today's 
  social reality requires the opposite kind of social policy, because any complexity 
  in practical policy will create social, fiscal and other boundaries which will 
  prevent social and individual change. Just one obvious example is children's 
  transfers from primary to secondary school, and another the transfer from Job 
  Seeker's Allowance to (so-called) 'tax credits' on an often small change in 
  the number of hours of employment. Liquid post-modernity requires simplicity 
  in social policy so that no boundaries get in the way of social or individual 
  change. Child Benefit and the NHS are obvious examples.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In complexity 
    science as in politics, prediction is perilous; agile humanity is forever 
    able to devise new challenges to the prevailing order; nothing is incontestable; 
    human beings can in some degree choose their futures. (p.305)<br>
