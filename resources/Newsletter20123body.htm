<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b><font size="4"><a name="Editorial"></a>Editorial</font></b> 
</font> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Government 
  is planning to localise Council Tax Benefit. Local authorities, which currently 
  administer a national scheme, will be asked to invent their own schemes. At 
  the same time, the amount of money available will be reduced, and local authorities' 
  ability to decide how to distribute the benefit between different demographic 
  groups will be constrained.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is certainly 
  the case that some functions belong with local government and some with central 
  government, and that a variety of factors will be involved in deciding in each 
  case whether regulations should be local, national, or a mixture of the two. 
  For instance, defence of the realm has to be a central government function, 
  and it is surely sensible for litter collection to be undertaken by local authorities. 
  In the middle ground will be such functions as health and education which for 
  good reasons are managed by a partnership between local and central government. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The question to 
  ask in relation to the Council Tax Benefit plan is this: Does the proposed localisation 
  make it easier or more difficult for the Government to manage its remaining 
  central government functions? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have already 
  expressed our view that Universal Credit is a step in the right direction because 
  it rationalises means-tested benefits to some extent, and it reduces the total 
  marginal deduction rate experienced by people in employment or entering employment, 
  thus providing slightly greater employment incentives than under the current 
  system. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A localised Council 
  Tax Benefit will make the administration of Universal Credit far more difficult 
  than it would have been otherwise, because claims in each local authority area 
  will need to be calculated differently. Universal Credit administration already 
  faces one major new challenge: synchronisation of computer systems at Her Majesty's 
  Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions. To add another 
  major challenge might cause administrative gridlock. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, each 
  local authority will determine its own withdrawal rates for Council Tax Benefits, 
  and will withdraw Council Tax Benefit at that rate at the same time as Universal 
  Credit is withdrawn by the DWP. This will destroy Iain Duncan Smith's plan for 
  a maximum national withdrawal rate in order to increase incentives to seek employment 
  and to increase earned income once in employment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a recent report 
  from the Institute for Fiscal Studies puts it: 'Achieving coherence between 
  council tax rebates and Universal Credit is complex. The need to make the new 
  rebates fit with Universal Credit makes local authorities' task of designing 
  schemes, already a difficult challenge given the tight timescale, into a truly 
  formidable one.' (1) This is a report that every Minister and MP should read. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is rare for 
  us to suggest that the Government should think again. In this case we have no 
  hesitancy in doing so; and no hesitancy in suggesting that if it does not do 
  so then Parliament should ensure that it does.</font></p>

  note: A Citizen's Income scheme's winners and losers </font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In our last edition 
  we published a research note which employed EUROMOD (1) to calculate the gains 
  and losses which a full range of individuals would experience if Working Tax 
  Credits and Child Tax Credits were to be replaced with nonwithdrawable benefits. 
  Tax Credits are only paid to people in employment, so the nonwithdrawable benefits 
  would only have been paid to people in employment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Here we use EUROMOD 
  to simulate the outcomes for a genuine Citizen's Income scheme: an unconditional 
  and nonwithdrawable benefit for every citizen. The aim of the exercise was to 
  test a variety of schemes for feasibility defined as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The net cost of 
  the scheme (that is, the cost of the Citizen's Incomes, less additional Income 
  Tax and National Insurance Contribution revenue and the money saved through 
  the abolition of existing benefits), should be affordable. We assume that a 
  net cost above &pound;3bn per annum would be unaffordable in the current circumstances. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No more than 5% 
  of individuals should suffer a loss of disposable income of more than 15%, and 
  no more than 10% of individuals should suffer a loss of disposable income of 
  more than 10%. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following scheme 
  was found to fit this definition of feasibility:</font></p>

</table>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the purpose 
  of this exercise, no attempt has been made to abolish or change current means-tested 
  benefits except for Working Tax Credits and Child Tax Credits. Because Citizen's 
  Incomes and Citizen's Pensions will be in payment, an additional number of individuals 
  should find their non-means-tested incomes to be sufficiently high to take them 
  above the means-tested benefits levels. The number of claimants should therefore 
  be reduced, and the amounts of means-tested benefits in payment should also 
  be reduced.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The EUROMOD simulation, 
  running with 2008 Family Resources Survey data and 2009 benefits regulations, 
  shows that 11.95m adults would have been in receipt of means-tested benefits, 
  whereas for the same data and our Citizen's Income scheme there would only have 
  been 7.65m in receipt. In 2009, the total means-tested benefits claimed (including 
  Working Tax Credits, Child Tax Credits, Housing Benefit, and Council Tax Benefit) 
  would have been &pound;57.7bn, whereas for the Citizen's Income scheme the total 
  means-tested benefits claimed would have been only &pound;26.9bn (much of which 
  would have been Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit). We can therefore see 
  that such a Citizen's Income scheme would have reduced by more than four million 
  the number of people suffering the disincentive effects imposed by means-tested 
  benefits. Somewhat less calculable, but perhaps more significant, would be the 
  number of people still in receipt of means-tested benefits who would seek additional 
  sources of earned income in order to lift their net incomes above the level 
  at which they would need to claim means-tested benefits. Anyone raising their 
  earned income in the context of Working Tax Credits knows that their Working 
  Tax Credits will be reduced and they will receive little benefit from their 
  additional effort or additional skills. In the context of a Citizen's Income 
  there is no such reduction, making it rather more likely that amongst those 
  still in receipt of means-tested benefits numerous individuals and households 
  will do all they can to lift their incomes high enough to escape the traps that 
  accompany means-testing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Gini coefficient 
  is a measure of inequality. The Gini coefficient for disposable income in relation 
  to the 2009 benefits regulations would have been 0.3403, whereas that for the 
  Citizen's Income scheme would have been 0.3304. Whilst this is not a major change, 
  it shows that a feasible Citizen's Income scheme might somewhat reduce inequality 
  in disposable incomes. The considerably reduced marginal deduction rates that 
  would be experienced automatically by four million people, and in practice by 
  others who would choose to remove themselves from means-tested benefits, would 
  promote increased disposable incomes in the lower earnings deciles and would 
  thus reduce income inequality even further. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The additional 
  cost of the Citizen's Income scheme would have been &pound;2.85bn, which is 
  within the &pound;3bn that we allowed ourselves.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is clearly 
  not the end of the discussion. At 4.18% the number of individuals facing a loss 
  in disposable income of more than 15% is too high; and at 8.2% the number facing 
  a loss of more than 10% is also too high. Some of these losses will be amongst 
  higher earners, and some will be because a couple will now be receiving twice 
  as much as a single person, meaning losses for single people and gains for couples. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are three 
  possible responses to this: 1. In the longer term, the lower marginal deduction 
  rates that all workers will experience will mean that it will be easier than 
  before to fill any gap in disposable income by increasing earned income. In 
  the shorter term: 2. It should be possible to reduce these figures by adjusting 
  Income Tax rates and the levels at which the different Citizen's Incomes are 
  paid. This would be at the cost of reducing the numbers of individuals seeing 
  immediate gains in their disposable incomes. This would not be a problem. The 
  aim of this Citizen's Income scheme is not to increase the immediate gains experienced 
  by a large proportion of the population. The aim is to reduce the marginal deduction 
  rates suffered by individuals and households, and to do it in an affordable 
  manner. 3. As Philippe Van Parijs suggests, such losses 'do not mean that a 
  [Citizen's Income] is unaffordable, but that a gradual approach is required 
  if sudden sharp falls in the disposable incomes of some households are to be 
  avoided'. (6)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The results of 
  this exercise suggest that by making a small number of changes to the present 
  system it is perfectly possible to establish a genuine Citizen's Income scheme. 
  What is now required is a more substantial research effort to seek a Citizen's 
  Income scheme similar to the one outlined above but with fewer people losing 
  more than 15% of their disposable incomes; and, just as importantly, to seek 
  the simple transitional steps that would be required in order to get there.

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1 EUROMOD was developed

  at the University of Essex. It employs Family Resources Survey data to calculate 
  the actual difference in disposable income experienced by individuals when a 
  change is made to the tax and benefits system. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2 Because EUROMOD 
  employs 2008 Family Resources Survey data in relation to 2009 tax and benefits 
  regulations and levels, the state retirement age employed for this exercise 
  is the state retirement age as it was in 2009. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3 For individuals 
  and households claiming means-tested benefits, Citizen's Incomes are counted 
  as income received for the purpose of calculating the level of benefit. So, 
  for instance, instead of Housing Benefit being withdrawn at 65% of the value 
  of Working Tax Credits, in this scheme Housing Benefit is withdrawn at 65% of 
  the value of Citizen's Incomes received by the household. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4 Most of those

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The <b>Institute 
  for Fiscal Studies</b> has published a report, <i>Reforming Council Tax Benefit</i>, 
  which reviews the Government's plan to localise Council Tax Benefit: 'Universal 
  Credit is intended to simplify the benefit system by reducing the number of 
  different benefits that claimants and administrators must contend with. Keeping 
  council tax support (the means-tested benefit with the largest number of recipients) 
  separate - and indeed allowing it to vary across the country - severely undermines 
  this simplification. Universal Credit is also intended to rationalise work incentives 
  by replacing a jumble of overlapping means tests with a single one, ensuring 
  that overall effective tax rates cannot rise too high. Again, separate means 
  tests for council tax support could undermine this, with the potential to reintroduce 
  some of the extremely weak work incentives that Universal Credit was supposed 
  to eliminate. It is difficult to think of reasons why the government's original 
  plan to integrate CTB into Universal Credit was inferior to what is now being 
  proposed' (pp.8-9). 'Achieving coherence between council tax rebates and Universal 
  Credit is complex. The need to make the new rebates fit with Universal Credit 
  makes local authorities' task of designing schemes, already a difficult challenge 
  given the tight timescale, into a truly formidable one. There is nothing in 
  the Universal Credit system that will make it straightforward to identify those 
  who should be passported onto a full council tax rebate. That could make running 
  a council tax rebate scheme based closely on the current system extremely challenging 
  for local authorities &#133; the advantages of localisation seem to be strongly 
  outweighed by the disadvantages, particularly in the context of the welcome 
  introductionof Universal Credit'. (p.107) <a href="http://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/6183" target="_blank">www.ifs.org.uk/publications/6183</a></font></p>

  scale, which uses research into minimum living costs to show greater economies 
  of living in a couple than the official equivalence scales, suggests that separation 
  penalties are larger and couple penalties smaller than those scales would suggest. 
  Indeed, it shows no case of significant couple penalty other than in the scenario 
  where the absent parent is able to live cheaply in social housing. Moreover, 
  even the official scale used by the Government (the OECD scale) does not show 
  a clear-cut economic advantage for families on low earnings to split up. In 
  the single earner cases shown here, it shows a couple penalty in one scenario, 
  a separation penalty in three scenarios and no difference in the other three. 
  On the other hand, for a couple with two earners, it shows a substantial couple 
  penalty in all but one of the five scenarios looked at here. So an in-work couple 
  penalty can be identified for a particular group of couples on a particular 
  set of assumptions.' (p.29). <a href="http://www.jrf.org.uk/publications/tax-and-benefit-couple-penalty" target="_blank">www.jrf.org.uk/publications/tax-and-benefit-couple-penalty</a></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dear Editor</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is always interesting 
  to read detailed arguments for a Citizen's Income, but might I invite your readers 
  to consider a broader reform programme which would entail a long-term foundation 
  for the Citizen's Income we all want to see? A reform programme which would 
  reconcile socialism and capitalism? Of course a claim such as this cannot be 
  fully argued in the space of a letter, but the principles can be simply stated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The most important 
  element in a new framework for the economy would be the evaluation of the social 
  costs and benefits of each kind of enterprise and, through a system of levies 
  and grants, their introduction into market prices. Other demands on industry 
  and commerce, most notably taxation of profits, would cease. Taxation would 
  be confined to individual participants in the economy, but in their capacity 
  as citizens or residents paying for the benefits society brings them. The Citizen's 
  Income should not be paid for out of a levy on economic enterprise.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Society, for its 
  part, should recognise its capital value as an instrument which makes enterprise 
  possible. And it should translate this value into a practical tool by the creation 
  of a sovereign wealth fund which would invest in stocks and shares at home and 
  abroad in parallel with other funds. Income from the fund would be dedicated 
  to the citizens, thus providing a funding base for a true citizen's income, 
  though the fund could also be used for collective initiatives. The model would 
  be Alaska's Permanent Fund. I leave on one side the priority support needed 
  by those who cannot be expected to support themselves in the economy, that is: 
  children, who are too young to work; the very elderly, who are past working; 
  and people who suffer chronic sickness or disability.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The size of the 
  fund ultimately required to make it worthwhile should not be underestimated. 
  As to practicalities, nations such as China already have sovereign wealth funds. 
  The way forward will become clearer once the principles and implications are 
  widely understood. Even if one doesn't want to go the whole way in redesigning 
  the framework of the economy, the creation of a sovereign wealth fund surely 
  provides a way forward by translating the value of society into a practical 
  reality for the benefit of all its members without imposing a levy on the economy. 
  At the same time, the fund would help to reduce the serious inequality in the 
  ownership of our capital.</font></p>

  Citizen's Income from Money Creation:<font size="2"> </font></font></b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">The 
  message of James Robertson's Future Money </font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By Conall Boyle</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 'sensible' 
  view of Citizen's Income (CI) is that it would pool income tax allowances and 
  welfare benefits, as far as possible, into a single uniform payment, varying 
  only with age, paid to every citizen, without conditions, funded in the main 
  by income tax. This model has been studied extensively, and can be discussed 
  with policy makers and advisors who understand the mechanisms and procedures 
  involved. But politically this is a complete non-starter: In his latest book 
  <i>Future Money</i>, (1) James Robertson comments 'The conventional assumption 
  has been that there is no way of funding a Citizen's Income except by taxing 
  people's other incomes highly, and it might have to be at a rate as high as 
  70%. For many years that has been seen as ruling out a Citizen's Income. Like 
  many objections to otherwise desirable proposals, the assumption is due to inability 
  or unwillingness to think outside a narrow box.&quot; (p135). But over the years 
  I have encountered another radically different view about the funding of Basic/Citizen's 
  Income. There is, it is claimed, a huge pool of money which has been hi-jacked 
  by the banks: they have used their power to create nearly all the money in circulation 
  and have thereby greatly enriched themselves. Most people are under the delusion 
  that it is governments not banks that create new money, but in fact only 3% 
  of all the money (M4) in circulation is official Bank of England notes or coins. 
  The remaining 97% has been created within the banking system and it is the banks 
  that reap the benefit. The 'mavericks' at BIRG (Basic Income Research Group) 
  and Citizen's Income Trust meetings who have pointed this out have always argued 
  that the benefit from creating new money rightfully belongs to the people, and 
  that it could/should be used to provide a Basic Income. In addition, Robertson 
  reminds us that there is also a vast amount of 'economic rent' which flows from 
  the ownership of natural assets like land and airspace. This should be charged 
  for, and, together with the proceeds from the creation of money, would provide 
  more than enough to pay for an adequate Citizen's Income.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 'free lunch' 
  basis for CI might in the past have been dismissed as either Mad or Bad. It 
  did not help that advocates of money reform who spoke at meetings of BIRG did 
  not always put forward their ideas with much tact either! I say that the idea 
  that BI/CI could be funded from money creation might be seen as madness, because 
  no mainstream, conventional economist could be found who would subscribe to 
  it. This remains the case, even today, after the Banking Crash of 2008.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But an even more 
  telling criticism is that the holders of this alternative view are Bad people. 
  In a vitriolic attack, Derek Wall, who was once the co-leader of the UK Green 
  Party, lays into 'Social Credit' (2). It was Major Douglas who inspired the 
  Social Credit movement in the 1930s, which could be described as an earlier 
  manifestation of Basic Income funded from money creation. In the hands of others, 
  Wall claims, this degenerated into an evil anti-Jewish-banking sentiment. Even 
  today's advocates, he claims, are similarly tainted. It is noticeable that the 
  Green Party does not support money-reform, and the New Economics Foundation 
  are somewhat ambivalent about it as well, perhaps as a reaction to this whiff 
  of 'dangerous madness'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Is it any wonder 
  then that Basic Income funded by the common-wealth of money creation and resource-charges 
  is seen as too hot to handle, too dangerous to be involved with, the deranged 
  delusions from a lunatic fringe or worse? It comes as a shock therefore to find 
  that James Robertson, the utterly reasonable and tireless campaigner for fresh 
  thinking about society and the environment, is entirely in favour of monetary 
  reform and land- and resource-based taxation. Using the proceeds of these two 
  revenue streams would, he tells us, be more than sufficient to fund Citizen's 
  Income and more besides.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this, Robertson's 
  latest book, he follows up on earlier inspiring works such as <i>The Sane Alternative</i> 
  (1983), <i>Future Work</i> (1985), <i>Future Wealth</i> (1990). Robertson ran 
  Turning Point conferences (which was where in the early 1980's I first encountered 
  Basic Income). He was a founder of TOES, the 'anti'-G8 economic summit forum, 
  and of course he is a leading light at NEF (New Economics Foundation). Later 
  his output has explored the transformation of tax away from penalising earned 
  incomes towards resource-based taxes, especially land-value taxes. <i>Sharing 
  Our Common Heritage: Resource Taxes and Green Dividends</i> (1998) explains 
  how it could be done. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then, hesitantly 
  at first (as I read it) but later as in this book currently under review, Robertson 
  has experienced an epiphany. It was indeed true that the money-system had been 
  hi-jacked by the banks, and that huge wealth was being diverted to the top 1% 
  thereby; that the control over the issue of new money should be returned to 
  a public authority and used for the public good. Together with Joseph Huber, 
  Robertson became converted to the idea that our money system should be prised 
  away from the clutches of the bankers in <i>Creating New Money: A Monetary Reform 
  for the Information Age</i>. This appeared in 2000, long before the 2008 financial 
  crash. Since then Robertson has continued with the monetary reform theme, something 
  which became much more pressing following the banking crash when vast sums were 
  created to rescue the financial system (so-called quantitative easing). So <i>Future 
  Money</i> is a synthesis which knits together his earlier ideas, with the all-important 
  reclamation of the money system. The aim, as always with Robertson's books is 
  to show how a credible &quot;sane&quot; alternative could give everyone a better 
  life, while at the same time creating an ecologically sustainable world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Robertson has a 
  wealth of experience in the ways of government and governing, including spells 
  at the UK Treasury and commercial banks, but his background is in Arts, not 
  economics. 'In retrospect, I am glad not to have had a formal education in economics 
  and money and to have learned about them in practice later within a wider context 
  of ideas.' (p13)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since Robertson 
  has long been a supporter of the idea of CI, it comes as no surprise when he 
  says that these revenues should be used to fund a 'Citizen's Income payable 
  to all citizens as a right. [..] It will recognise that responsible citizens 
  in a democratic society have a right to share a significant part of the public 
  revenue from the value of common resources. It will enable people to become 
  less dependent for welfare and work on big government, big business, big finance 
  and foreign trade. Because all of those incur environmentally wasteful overhead 
  costs, it will also have a conserving effect.' (p130)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are a small 
  number of 'heterodox' economists who would agree with Robertson that the proceeds 
  of money creation exist and that they have been captured by the private banking 
  system, but that they could be re-directed for the benefit of the citizenry. 
  Perhaps the most high-profile (although not referred to by Robertson) is Steve 
  Keen. His book <i>Debunking Economics</i> (2011, 2nd ed, Zed Books) is about 
  the whole range of failures of the dominant neo-classical economics paradigm, 
  especially its inability to recognise and incorporate money into its models. 
  Few establishment figures will engage with Keen, and even open-minded economists 
  like Paul Krugman still do not agree that money is 'endogenous' . However, compelling 
  evidence that the banking system benefits from a huge public subsidy can be 
  found in a recent Bank of England paper where the 'free lunch' for the banking 
  system is estimated to be of the order of &pound;120 bn. p.a., enough to fund 
  a &pound;40 per week Citizen's Income for every man, woman and child in the 
  U.K.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I would encourage 
  readers of the <i>Citizen's Income Newsletter</i> to study this book closely. 
  There is much more detail about the environmental and humanitarian reasons for 
  reforming the way currency is produced and how resources should be taxed. You 
  will have to decide for yourself if you think the Government reclaiming control 
  over the benefit from money creation of money is a realistic method of funding 
  CI, or is crazy dangerous nonsense. The safe alternative is to continue studying 
  the present job-system and see how an added-on CI funded by punitive rates of 
  income tax might work, however futile and politically infeasible that might 
  be. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Social solidarity 
  is 'a contested, fluid, multilevel and multifaceted concept within the European 
  polity, civil society and the public realm.' This volume treats this solidarity 
  as 'a lived experience, a shared learning experience and a normative construct,' 
  (p.11) at the heart of which is a conflict between the EU's Stability and Growth 
  Pact, with predictable inequalities resulting from competitive labour markets, 
  and a European Social Model predicated on human rights and social protections 
  from the inequalities generated by both a globalizing economy and such policies 
  as the Stability and Growth Pact. In the context of today's austerity measures, 
  the book seeks both an understanding of social solidarity in Europe and new 
  means to create an enhanced social solidarity, nationally, within Europe, and 
  globally. So is globalization a problem to solidarity? No. There has been no 
  'race to the bottom' amongst European welfare states, and people still find 
  their solidarities in their families and communities. And yes, in the sense 
  that national institutional solidarities now need to be supplemented by transnational 
  ones, such as those generated by the EU. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Different chapters 
  study what solidarity might mean in terms of social policy related to children, 
  social movements (such as trade unionism), energy policy, immigration integration 
  policy, and a European politics in which policy instruments might reduce rather 
  than enhance social solidarity simply because the political process will always 
  prioritise certain interests over others. The chapter which describes this last 
  process is appropriately followed by one which shows that in post-communist 
  European states the establishment of market economies has caused governments 
  to discard such solidarities as predictable local labour markets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A particularly 
  interesting set of empirical results is represented by a table on p.219 which 
  shows how people in different European countries differ in their attitude to 
  government intervention to redistribute resources ( - the UK is midrange), but 
  also that those differences are small compared to average EU acceptance of government 
  intervention. The author of this chapter, B&eacute;la Janky, concludes that 
  'Eurosceptic claims about the lack of any common ground for a Europe-wide social 
  policy framework are unfounded' (p.223).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The editor concludes 
  that, whilst there are pressures towards increasing individualization and fragmentation, 
  there are policy areas in which European social solidarity is more of a reality 
  than it was (for instance, in energy policy), and it doesn't seem unrealistic 
  when he calls for a reinvention of social solidarity on a variety of levels. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whilst books such 
  as this can sometimes suffer from a sense of fragmentation born of the fact 
  that each contributor has written about the subjects in which they personally 
  are interested, the overall impression of this volume is that there is something 
  called social solidarity and that in terms of its future there is everything 
  to play for. Social solidarity at every level faces challenges, but there are 
  also signs of increasing solidarity in particular policy areas, and that a broader 
  social solidarity is perfectly possible.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This data-packed 
  book is one of a series of publications to emerge from the EU-funded Programme 
  on Reconciling Work and Welfare in Europe (RECWOWE). The programme's context 
  is the tensions between work and welfare - </font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the tension between 
    employer demands for more labour market flexibility and citizens' need for 
    economic security; the tensions between the increased participation in paid 
    work and the importance of family life, the greater fluidity in family relationships, 
    and the greater flexibility in the labour markets; the friction between quantity 
    and quality of the jobs to be created, between job creation and maintaining 
    or improving the quality of employment and finally the conflicts raised by 
    the need to adapt (industrial) social protection systems to new labour market 
    structures (p.xviii)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and the programme's 
  task is to understand the relationship between work and welfare in the many 
  different national contexts across Europe. This book's task is to understand 
  in-work poverty, and in particular the institutional and policy factors which 
  affect it. The editors identify as particular worries the growing segmentation 
  and casualisation of employment and the downward pressures on the wages of low-skilled 
  workers (p.3). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first part 
  of the book offers comparative statistical analysis of the situation across 
  Europe. Amongst the conclusions are that in the UK in-work poverty is caused 
  both by partners' low labour market participation and by low wages (p.32) and 
  that in an era of high unemployment active labour market policies cannot on 
  their own prevent poverty. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second part 
  contains chapters on various countries. The chapter on the UK concludes that 
  working poverty is rising, that it is due mainly to low work intensity (p.91), 
  and that means-tested in-work benefits have kept in-work poverty down to average 
  European levels, which our earnings inequalities would otherwise have taken 
  us above. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The third part 
  of the book tackles cross-cutting themes and finds high mobility (in-work poverty 
  is often transitory and recurrent) (p.199). Studied as individuals, women more 
  often suffer in-work poverty than men (a fact not often noticed because so many 
  women are in households with men) (p.229), that standard of living inequalities 
  correlate closely to individual wage inequalities (p.246), and that in-work 
  poverty is higher amongst non-EU migrant workers than amongst migrant workers 
  from within the EU (p.271). A chapter on the effect of tax and benefits policies 
  on in-work poverty finds, unsurprisingly, that means-tested benefits mean that 
  higher earnings often don't translate into higher disposable incomes (p.281). 
  It also suggests that there is a trade-off between redistribution and employment 
  incentives, and finds that in-work benefits can cause a particularly acute disincentive 
  problem for a household's second earner, resulting in adverse effects on the 
  incentive structure for couple households (p.302). The authors find that incentives 
  are not an important determinant of employment rates amongst the low-skilled. 
  In countries where work pays the least, in-work poverty is lower because general 
  anti-poverty policies reduce in-work poverty as well as out-of-work poverty, 
  and that in-work benefits most effectively increase employment and reduce inequality 
  where wage inequalities are high. The authors 'question the political pertinence 
  of an instrument whose effectiveness is greatly reduced when approaching its 
  apparent objective'. It is stating the obvious to suggest that in an economic 
  downturn the priority should be generous universal unemployment benefits (p.302).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In their overall 
  conclusions, the editors find labour market activation policies to be expensive 
  and relatively ineffective, and the UK's in-work means-tested benefits expensive 
  and a source of disincentives, particularly for a household's second earner: 
  'Research ... does not indicate a strong effect overall on employment levels 
  in spite of claims to 'make work pay'. This is likely to be affected by other 
  aspects of the institutional context, notably benefits for those not working 
  and the conditions attached to them.' (p.314)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This comprehensive 
  and thoroughly-researched book quite rightly offers no simple political programme 
  for the reduction of in-work poverty. What it does offer is a sense of the complexity 
  of this policy field, and a source of information and properly tentative conclusions 
  which anyone attempting to develop policy in the field really ought to read.

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Time was when a 
  lifetime of full-time employment would be followed by retirement on a contributory 
  state pension supplemented, for the fortunate, by an occupational pension, and, 
  for the less fortunate, by a means-tested state supplementary pension. Both 
  employment and retirement income were relatively secure. Employment is now less 
  secure, and increasing numbers of people experience part-time employment, short-term 
  contracts, and periods of unemployment, making 'flexicurity' an important social 
  policy aim: flexible labour markets accompanied by secure incomes and public 
  services.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The chapters in 
  this book are the result of a European Commission funded research project on 
  the prospects for income security in old age in a Europe increasingly characterised 
  by insecure employment and therefore flexible employment patterns. The problem 
  that policy-makers and the book's authors face is that many state and occupational 
  pension schemes are posited on the now outdated notion of the 'standard employment 
  relationship' - lifelong, stable full-time employment. Such schemes, whether 
  state, occupational, or private, are funded by employee and employer contributions. 
  Less stable employment patterns mean fewer and lower contributions and thus 
  less income security in old age. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Each of the book's 
  chapters studies the current pension structure, labour market position, and 
  recent reforms, in a particular country. There are chapters on Germany, Italy, 
  Poland, Switzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the UK. The editors conclude 
  that these countries fall into three groups and that each group exhibits a particular 
  pattern of recent reforms. Countries that previously relied for retirement income 
  on state contributory pensions have raised contribution rates and/or subsidized 
  the insurance fund out of general taxation, and have now introduced private 
  and occupational pension schemes. In countries with already more than one of 
  the three 'pillars' of pension provision - state, occupational, and private 
  - the emphasis has tilted towards private and occupational schemes, and now 
  towards compulsory enrolment in funded portable defined contribution schemes 
  which blur the boundary between private and occupational pensions. Eastern European 
  countries are seeing both the development of contributory public schemes and 
  a transition into privately funded pensions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the basis of 
  the research results presented in the individual chapters the editors conclude 
  that in segmented labour markets (for instance, in Germany, where 'insiders' 
  still experience considerable employment security, and 'outsiders' highly insecure 
  employment) pension provision 'dis-integrates': that is, it is worse at poverty 
  prevention and income maintenance for those experiencing more fragmented labour 
  market participation than for those in more secure employment; that in countries 
  with more homogenous labour markets (as in the UK, where employment insecurity 
  is more equally shared across the labour market) there are integrating elements 
  in the pension system; and that where the labour market is highly homogenous, 
  as in Denmark, the pension system is highly integrated. Central to the integrating 
  characteristics of Denmark's and the Netherlands' systems are their 'generous 
  basic pensions based on residence ... These schemes are crucial in preventing 
  poverty in old age, especially for workers with interrupted carers or on an 
  atypical contract, as well as women, who mainly work part-time' (p.244). What 
  isn't entirely clear is what's causing what: Does a more or less homogenous 
  labour market result in a particular pattern of reforms, or is there some third 
  factor causing both the labour market type and the reform pattern?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the UK we might 
  soon be moving in a more universalist direction. If we want to prevent poverty 
  in old age then the evidence of this book suggests that it is in this direction 
  that we should move, because it is in this direction that flexicurity can be 
  achieved. The more general lesson to be drawn from the book is that poverty 
  prevention and income maintenance in old age will be best served across Europe 
  by universal state pensions accompanied by compulsory enrolment in portable 
  funded defined contribution schemes to which both employer and employee contribute.

  in the New Europe: Social protection and the challenges of integration</i><font size="2">, 
  Policy Press, 2011, xiv + 261 pp, hbk, 1 847 42644 4, &pound;70</font></font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The introductory 
  chapter of this timely edited collection outlines the issues to be discussed 
  throughout: policy combinations, institutions and political structures, and 
  the resulting integration and inclusion of migrants. This is followed by a discussion 
  of the role of emotions, beliefs, preferences and opportunities in policy-making.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first part 
  of the book contains chapters on the differences between different national 
  migrant integration regimes (always the result of different political economics 
  of labour and welfare); on the European Union's attempt at a coherent migration 
  policy which links utility, security and integration policies; on the contradiction 
  between the right to emigrate and a destination country's ability to deny entry 
  (meaning that we need a new European migration morality); and on the causes 
  of migration and of different degrees of labour market integration. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second part 
  contains studies of migration and social protection policies in different EU 
  countries. In Italy, the relative importance of social protection provided to 
  employees in large companies disadvantages migrants, who tend to work in smaller 
  companies. Migrants are also disadvantaged by their weaker position in relation 
  to welfare rights and their security of residence. Germany practises differential 
  inclusion, with guest workers the least included, second-generation German-born 
  people somewhat more included, and ethnic German repatriates the most included. 
  The social security regime, being based largely on contribution records, disadvantages 
  migrants. In Hungary, EU accession has added new elements to an already complex 
  migration pattern.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The chapter on 
  Finland contains the most detailed study of a social security system and its 
  relationship to migration. In Finland's case residency is a more important criterion 
  than employment status or length of labour market participation. Because immigrants 
  often don't achieve rights to residency, their access to the main social security 
  provisions remains employment-based and thus precarious, leaving them reliant 
  on a low-level means-tested safety net.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The chapter on 
  the UK, accurately entitled 'wilful negligence &#133; the absence of social 
  protection in the UK,' details UK immigrants' lack of access to the labour market 
  and to social security benefits, and also a detention regime which includes 
  the incarceration of children. The UK has a long history of both permanent and 
  temporary immigration, which has resulted in complex and differentiated labour 
  market patterns. It's a pity that a detailed case study doesn't include a section 
  on immigrants' social security experiences. What does emerge is a picture of 
  insecure recent immigrants and of exploited migrant workers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final section 
  of the book integrates into an understanding of migrant experience of a number 
  of disparate cultural and political factors, and here the UK's multicultural 
  policies fare rather better than our treatment of illegal immigrants and asylum-seekers 
  awaiting determinations of their status. The first chapter in this section asks 
  that welfare right should be viewed in the context of each cultural situation; 
  the second studies the influence of urban, sub-national policy actors; and the 
  third compares Israel's positive attempts to integrate (certain groups of) immigrants 
  with Europe's more patchy experience.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The concluding 
  chapter finds social security regulations to be discriminating, and it puts 
  to us the challenge of creating 'inclusion, integration and social protection' 
  (p.253) for migrants across Europe. Advocates of a Citizen's Income approach 
  to benefits reform will recognise this as a challenge which a Citizen's Income 
  would meet, but only if a Citizen's Income is to be paid to every current resident, 
  including new arrivals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beatrice Webb's 
  contribution to a Royal Commission on the Poor Law just over a hundred years 
  ago was a Minority Report which set out five main principles:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Poverty has 
    structural causes</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prevention is

    be integrated</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The state, not 
    philanthropy, is responsible. (p.11)</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Government 
  of the time took no notice, but Beveridge had worked as a research assistant 
  on the Minority Report and its findings clearly informed his own 1942 report 
  on National Insurance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The world is now 
  different, but poverty persists, and the contributors to this collection of 
  essays ask themselves: What would Beatrice Webb have said today? Their suggestions 
  include minimum income standards, supporting poor children in working families 
  (which does <i>not</i> mean enforced low-paying employment), restoring the Child 
  Trust Fund, small-scale lending, raising the tax threshold, retaining universal 
  Child Benefit, reducing labour-market disincentives (rather than regenerating 
  poor neighbourhoods), affirmative action to address discrimination and exclusion, 
  and the active pursuit of gender equality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his final chapter, 
  the editor lists four definitions of poverty: 'absolute low income &#133; relative 
  low income &#133; material deprivation &#133; index of multiple deprivation 
  &#133;' (p.119): but these are all static concepts. A dynamic definition of 
  poverty would be this: 'A structural inability to create one's own path out 
  of poverty'. This definition reveals high marginal deduction rates and complex 
  administrative and income uncertainty and continuity problems on changing one's 
  employment status to be the serious problems which they are. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of particular interest 
  is the number of suggestions which would reduce marginal deduction rates. Peter 
  Kenway suggests 'raising the level of the personal allowance to remove low earners 
  from income tax altogether; raising the level of the income thresholds above 
  which benefits and tax credits start to be tapered and/or council tax begins 
  to become payable; reducing the rate at which tax credits and benefits are tapered 
  away as earnings rise; &#133; reintroducing a (lower) starting rate of income 
  tax' (p.56); and Jonathan Bradshaw calls for Child Benefit to remain universal 
  and shows how effective it is at reducing poverty. Of equal interest is Steve 
  Osborn's finding that 'the uncertainties created by the current benefits system 
  and its implications for moving poor people into employment' (p.80) is a serious 
  problem.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If increasing inequality 
  is a major problem, if income uncertainty across changes in someone's labour 
  market status are a problem, and if high marginal deduction rates are a major 
  cause of poverty (and in the context of a dynamic understanding of poverty they 
  are), then surely what Beatrice Webb would be saying today is what she said 
  in 1909: that universal services are what's required; and she would also be 
  saying today that a universal unconditional income for every age-group would 
  prevent poverty, would tackle some of poverty's structural causes, would reduce 
  dependency, and would integrate tax and benefits, and that it is the state's 
  responsibility to see that it happens.</font></p>

  <font size="2">Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, xv + 271 pp, hbk, 0 230 28542 2, &pound;57.50</font></font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This book is a 
  most useful survey of international experience of Basic or Citizen's Income, 
  of benefits sufficiently similar to enable them to be regarded as on the way 
  to a Citizen's Income, and of significant legislative attempts at Citizen's 
  Incomes. The book complements Basic Income Guarantee and Politics, edited by 
  Richard Caputo and recently published by the same publisher, with which it overlaps 
  to some extent, but not too much. Both books are essential reading for anyone 
  interested in how experience of Citizen's Income, and debate about it, are developing 
  worldwide.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of the material 
  in the first part of the book will be familiar to readers of this Newsletter, 
  but some will not be. The Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend will be well known, 
  but less well known will be some highly positive results from United States 
  and Canadian Negative Income Tax experiments. This Newsletter has already reported 
  stunning results from the Namibian Citizen's Income pilot project, but less 
  well known are the complexities of Brazil's and Canada's political economies 
  and their effects on benefit reform.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second part 
  of the book describes Basic Income proposals for East Timor, Catalonia, South 
  Africa, Ireland, Germany, New Zealand, and Australia. The overall impression 
  is of a widespread global debate, different in different countries, but with 
  lots of connections between the different national debates. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Murray's concluding 
  chapter is understandably effusive about the results of the Namibian pilot project, 
  and about the brake on inequality provided by the Alaskan Permanent Fund Dividend. 
  Conditional schemes, on the other hand, are found to lead to new inequalities 
  (p.253), and tax credit and negative income tax schemes to have similar problems 
  (p.255). Murray recognises the different effects of different political contexts, 
  and this reviewer was particularly struck by ways in which more federal political 
  arrangements, such as those in the USA and Brazil, can make the debate more 
  possible locally but quite complex nationally.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One issue over 
  which the editors seem to be somewhat confused is that of terminolog. In this 
  book, 'Basic Income' usually means an unconditional and nonwithdrawable income 
  for every citizen, but sometimes it means a class of benefit types of which 
  an unconditional benefit is one member (e.g., p.251), which leaves the unconditional 
  and universal benefit without a name. A similar problem arises in the introductory 
  chapter, which lists some important questions: What form should the payment 
  take? How much should it be? Should it be unconditional? Should it be universal? 
  Can it be afforded? How should it be funded? Some of these questions are 'controversial 
  questions' surrounding 'Basic Income' (p.2) if 'Basic Income' is understood 
  as an unconditional, nonwithdrawable and universal income: but some are not. 
  The question 'Should the payment be universal?' is a question about whether 
  we should have a Basic Income. It is not a question about a Basic Income. Similarly, 
  'Should the income be paid unconditionally?' is a question about whether or 
  not we should have a Basic Income. By the end of the introduction we are entirely 
  unsure about what the term 'Basic Income' means. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I know that this 
  has been said in these pages before, but it clearly needs saying again: clarity 
  of definition is essential to rational debate. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our position is 
  this: A 'Citizen's Income' or a 'Basic Income' is an unconditional, nonwithdrawable 
  income for every individual as a right of citizenship. The terms should not 
  be used for anything else. Other terms, such as 'social dividend' and 'universal 
  grant' are equivalent, but only if they mean the same thing. (We do not use 
  'Basic Income Guarantee' because a guaranteed income can mean an income achieved 
  by means-tested benefits.) Widespread agreement on the meaning of terminology 
  would considerably help the clarity of debate, both individual national debates 
  and the global debate, and it would have helped the editors and authors of the 
  book under review to express themselves more clearly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But having said 
  all that: Murray and Pateman have provided us with a most useful collection 
  of essays on some highly significant Citizen's Income experiences and debates, 
  and anyone interested in that debate should read this book. </font></p>

  pp, pbk, 0 7456 5178 1, &pound;12.99</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hartley Dean's 
  passion for social policy is rooted in twelve years spent working for an advice 
  centre in Brixton. This reviewer's passion for the subject stems from just two 
  years working in Brixton's Supplementary Benefit Office around the same time, 
  but the question that has stayed with both of us is the same: How can we most 
  effectively make provision for diverse human need? This second edition of Dean's 
  'short introduction' on social policy is even more focussed on this question 
  than the first edition, and although it retains the structure and much of the 
  content of the first edition, it fully recognises the social and social policy 
  change that has occurred during the last six years: for instance, the increasing 
  expectations of the voluntary sector in relation to service provision. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rather than being 
  structured around such topic areas as education, health, and poverty, as some 
  introductory texts in social policy are, this book is structured around a series 
  of questions: What is social policy? Where did it come from? Why on earth does 
  it matter? What does human wellbeing entail? Who gets what? Who's in control? 
  What's the trouble with human society? Can social policy solve social problems? 
  How are the times a-changing? Where is social policy going? A topic approach 
  offers the student an understanding of discrete social policy fields, but will 
  not necessarily enable them to grasp what social policy is or why it matters, 
  whereas reading Dean's book, and grappling with the questions that it asks and 
  attempts to answer, will hammer home for the student that social policy is about 
  the systematic meeting of human need. (The new edition has benefited from Dean's 
  recent work on human need, published in 2010 in his book <i>Understanding Human 
  Need</i>.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If there were to 
  be a third edition then I would ask for two additions:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As an advice worker, 
  Dean would have grappled with the administrative complexity of the means-tested 
  benefits administered by the office for which I once worked. The code of regulations 
  filled a bookshelf, and knowing one's way around those regulations was a major 
  task in itself. But whilst means-tested benefits are discussed in the book, 
  there is no mention of the administrative complexity which they impose on individuals 
  and households. 'Administration' is not in the index. A general long-term shift 
  in academic interest is in evidence here. If Dean had been a professor at the 
  LSE during its earlier years, then he would have worked in the Department of 
  Social Policy and Administration, rather than in the Social Policy Department. 
  To include material on the administrative complexity of means-tested benefits 
  in the next edition of his book would help tor reinterest social policy departments 
  in such important administrative matters. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Dean helpfully 
  distinguishes between Social Policy (capitalised: the academic subject) and 
  social policies and social policy (lower case: policies enacted, and the category 
  to which they belong). What would be helpful in the next edition of the book 
  would be more discussion of the policy <i>process</i>: that is, how do social 
  problems come to be recognised as such, how are political considerations <i>in 
  practice</i> involved in the process, and how do policy ideas become legislation 
  and regulations? Perhaps in the next edition we shall find 'civil service' and 
  'think tank' in the index.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But having said 
  all that, this is a most useful book, and it is good to have an updated edition. 
  Social policies matter, and therefore Social Policy matters. The book will give 
  to undergraduate social policy students a good grounding in the questions at 
  the heart of their discipline, and will remind them why they are studying the 
  subject. What would be even more interesting would be for an examinations board 
  to establish an A level in social policy ( - a social policy module already 
  exists within a sociology A level) and for a new edition of Dean's book to be 
  written in a format appropriate for sixth formers. This would do wonders both 
  for Social Policy and for social policy.</font></p>

  is the Wrong Answer to Debt: A Call for a New Paradigm</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">by Geoff Crocker</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>The delinkage 
  of productivity and real wages is the underlying cause of the economic crisis. 
  As a result of this delinking, consumer income has lagged output GDP, and the 
  gap has been funded by consumer credit and increased debt-financed welfare payments. 
  This proved unsustainable, and so led to the coalition's current austerity policy 
  and GDP cuts. An alternative paradigm is needed in which the financial sector 
  is re-engineered and financial instruments redefined to serve the real economy.</i></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The debt crisis 
  persists. In the US, the Eurozone, and the UK, politicians are implementing 
  dire austerity packages in order to reduce government deficits. Greece and Italy 
  may be in the worst position, but the phenomenon deeply affects the majority 
  of developed economies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Faulty thinking</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How has this come 
  about? The popular answer trotted out as the daily news mantra that governments 
  have been reckless, bankers have been greedy, and consumers have been overspending, 
  is too simplistic. The problem has deeper roots and causes, and will continue 
  unabated unless these are better understood and addressed by policy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current talk is 
  entirely monetarist. Economics is reduced to some sort of meta-accountancy. 
  Keynes is derided by people who have never read him. Leading economics media 
  commentators often have no formal economics training or degrees. Economics degrees 
  themselves have often been restyled as 'economics, finance and business' degrees. 
  The British Chancellor of the Exchequer tells the nation that it 'cannot afford' 
  economic activity, which has to be cut because we simply 'don't have the money'. 
  But the real economy is about real resources of people, skills, infrastructure, 
  technology, land. All of these are available.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Standing back for 
  a moment, isn't it curious that human societies allow the money that they themselves 
  create as an artefact to serve the real economy, then allow it to dictate their 
  real economic behaviour? The tail really is wagging the dog. In the present 
  structure, governments must raise money from the bond markets, who insist on 
  repayment at interest rates which these markets determine according to their 
  own level of confidence. Thus society and its governments are entirely subject 
  to the prescriptions of bond dealers and credit rating agency speculators, who 
  have no remit or capability in social leadership and management. Curious again, 
  that UK political comment which is so troubled about 'handing sovereignty to 
  Brussels', and to non-elected technocrats, is entirely supine in handing far 
  greater sovereignty to bond dealers and credit rating agencies. Standard and 
  Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch are entirely unelected and lack any democratic accountability, 
  and yet are allowed to sit in easy judgment on our total economies, and to determine 
  their prospects and scope for action. We can thank Michel Barnier, the EC Internal 
  Market Commissioner, for seeking to constrain them. He deserves our support.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Rethinking money</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We need a new paradigm 
  in which we understand money and financial agencies as servants rather than 
  as masters of the real economy. Money is virtual, not real. It does not obey 
  the laws of thermodynamics : it can be created or destroyed. Commercial banks 
  do this regularly. They operate lending ratios whereby they lend a multiple 
  of the deposits lodged with them. Market economies 'print money' all the time 
  in this way as a regular practice. A sustained total run on the banks would 
  always cause them to collapse. The system is supported only by confidence. The 
  only rule is that the amount of money in circulation has to be matched by real 
  output, if its value is to be maintained. To allow monetary factors to determine 
  policy for the real economy is like trying to drive a car by bending its speedometer 
  needle. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>An alternative 
  diagnostic</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So what alternative 
  diagnostic of the ongoing debt crisis is available? A thought experiment might 
  help. In an imaginary totally automated economy with no workers, there would 
  be no wages, and therefore no effective monetised demand. Goods and services 
  would therefore have to be allocated by government to consumers by some voucher 
  or shareholder mechanism. As Bob Crow, the RMT union leader put it in his 'Lunch 
  with the Financial Times' interview in March last year, 'if you have robots 
  build cars, how are robots going to buy them?'. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A more erudite 
  version of the same concept comes from Professor Robert Solow, a distinguished 
  emeritus professor at MIT and Nobel Economics Laureate, who points out that 
  with burgeoning production from advanced technologies 'the wage will absorb 
  only a small fraction of all that output. The rest will be imputed to capital...the 
  extreme case of this is the common scare about universal robots : labour is 
  no longer needed at all. How will we then live? ....The ownership of capital 
  will have to be democratised...(needing) some form of universal dividend...Not 
  much thought has been given to this problem' (in 'Revisiting Keynes' by Pecchi 
  and Piga, MIT Press 2010, p92).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this scenario, 
  the total voucher spend by the government would represent an unavoidable debt 
  which would never be paid off. We are not there, but we have strong elements 
  of this scenario in our modern technological economies. The delinking of productivity 
  and real wages makes debt inevitable. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A general diagnostic 
  for technologically advanced economies then emerges that whenever productivity 
  exceeds real wages, and if the difference is not fed through to consumer demand 
  via increased shareholder dividends or social transfer payments, then consumer 
  demand will be insufficient to purchase output GDP. In this situation, which 
  can and does occur, the shortfall in consumer demand can be made up by extended 
  consumer credit and welfare payments, or output GDP can be cut in a recession. 
  The diagnostic bears some resemblance to Marx's and Keynes's thinking on the 
  implications for technology, automation and productivity on the economy, but 
  should not be dismissed for this honourable association.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> <b>A recent history 
  of the problem</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2007 was the root

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. increased productivity 
  reduces the wage and household income element of GDP and this demand drop leads 
  to a GDP recession</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">or 2. the demand 
  gap is filled by increased consumer credit and government debt to fund welfare 
  payments, which becomes un-repayable in the next period. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neither is sustainable 
  and leads to banks reducing consumer credit, and government cutting the real 
  economy in the mistaken belief that this will eliminate its deficit. This is 
  where we are now, and without a radical rethink, we will be chasing our tails 
  for ever in the doomed attempt to write off deficits from an ever shrinking 
  GDP. Those who call for increased government expenditure under a Plan B to raise 
  GDP (which would have the effect of raising the tax take and reducing welfare 
  payments and hence reducing the deficit) are derided by their critics who ask 
  how it can be possible to incur debt to reduce debt. But the coalition's Plan 
  A insistence on cutting the economy to reduce the deficit has to explain how 
  GDP can be increased by cutting GDP.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>New thinking</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An alternative 
  paradigm is needed to frame an alternative policy. There is nothing wrong with 
  the real economy. Its factories, transport and communications infrastructure, 
  skilled labour, restaurants etc. are all fully operational and highly efficient. 
  There is also plenty of real demand for goods and services, especially globally 
  from developing country consumers. It is purely the financial system which is 
  disabling the real economy, and it is the financial sector which therefore urgently 
  needs re-engineering.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is commonly 
  said that banks lent too much credit in 2007, firstly in the US sub-prime mortgage 
  market, and then widely in the UK economy. But the above analysis shows that 
  &pound;55bn of bank lending was exactly the right amount needed to purchase 
  GDP output, a claim which is substantiated by the lack of inflation in goods 
  and services markets both then and throughout the NICE decade. It is true that 
  asset prices inflated, but this resulted from any credit beyond that &pound;55bn. 
  The &pound;55bn consumer credit matched against GDP output was non-inflationary. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Distributive 
  considerations</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Productivity growth 
  in excess of real wage growth, and the gap between consumer income and GDP output 
  that this produces, has distributive consequences. Between social groups, it 
  tends to disfavour the poor, who rely more on the wage element of income, who 
  suffer the loss of low-skilled employment when automation displaces labour, 
  and whose access to credit as a replacement for wages is weak. Welfare payments 
  are their only recourse. Surprisingly, the Institute of Fiscal Studies report 
  'Poverty and Inequality in the UK: 2011' shows that increased welfare payments 
  did overcome income disadvantage. According to the IFS study, child poverty 
  at 20% is now the lowest since 1985, and pensioner poverty is currently lower 
  than at any point in the last 50 years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The sectoral distribution 
  of GDP is also affected by automation. Manufacturing employment and real wages 
  per unit of output will fall, and much of this employment is transferred to 
  low wage service sectors of the economy, only some of which, like banking, are 
  subject to automation and productivity improvement. From anecdotal evidence, 
  increased low productivity, low-wage service sector employment has absorbed 
  employment reduction in more automated manufacturing sectors, and masked the 
  effect of productivity in reducing aggregate real wages. Population growth is 
  another factor masking the demand deficiency resulting from the delinkage of 
  productivity and real wages.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We could of course 
  take the view that reduced consumption is exactly what we want as part of a 
  new ascetic paradigm to conserve world resources. Competition for natural resources 
  from China and India may well force this choice on us anyway. But if we do pursue 
  this option, income redistribution to those newly unemployed through productivity 
  gains unmatched by new demand will be an essential part of the paradigm. Some 
  form of welfare payment which does not add to government debt would be needed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A Citizen's 
  Income - the only route to stop debt being inevitable as productivity grows</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If it is accepted 
  that the delinkage of productivity and real wages will make an element of debt 
  financing inevitable, then a possible way forwards is a non-repayable financial 
  instrument, a universal credit. This would have to be non-repayable at both 
  consumer and government level. Proposals for a citizen's income are longstanding. 
  Such an income would not be repayable by the consumer and could be financed 
  without incurring government debt. This could be done by creating a public sector 
  bank with a government deposit, and a lending ratio set to exactly meet the 
  shortfall between output GDP made possible by increased productivity, and flat 
  or declining real wages. If the &pound;55bn incurred as consumer credit in 2007 
  had instead been funded in this way then the economy would not face the crisis 
  that it faces today. We have to think outside the box. Calls for a plan B are 
  stuck within the present paradigm. This new paradigm would re-engineer the financial 
  sector and the management of inevitable debt. It would release the real economy 
  from artificial financial constraint, and deliver sound finances built on productivity 
  advances. It would also greatly enhance social cohesion.</font></p>
