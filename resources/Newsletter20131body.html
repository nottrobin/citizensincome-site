</font> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an article in 
  The Guardian on the 10th September Frank Field MP raised serious concerns about 
  both the principle and the viability of 'Universal Credit' ( - we use quotation 
  marks because it is far from universal and it is a benefit and not a credit). 
  His criticisms relate to monthly rather than weekly or fortnightly payments, 
  and to a marginal deduction rate still at 65%. A major concern, expressed both 
  by Field and by the computer industry, is that for 'Universal Credit' payments 
  to be accurate, the computer systems of employers, Her Majesty's Revenue and 
  Customs, and the Department for Work and Pensions, will all need to communicate 
  with each other in an accurate and timely way, at least once a month, over every 
  single 'Universal Credit' claimant. This would be a tall order for a simple 
  benefits and tax system, but for our complex tax and benefits system the plan 
  could be called heroic. Just to mention one major complexity: We are taxed as 
  individuals, but 'Universal Credit' claims are assessed on the household. If 
  all of the necessary computer systems work together accurately, all of the time, 
  then this IT project will be a most spectacular technological achievement. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What Field did 
  not mention was that at the same time as 'Universal Credit' is being implemented, 
  Council Tax Benefit is being localised. Different Local Authorities will be 
  able to apply different taper rates, thus making it impossible for the Government 
  to keep the overall taper rate to 65%, impossible for national policy on taper 
  rates to be either formulated or implemented, and impossible for individuals 
  and households to predict how much of every extra &pound;1 earned they will 
  be able to keep. And which is it to be? Will income post-'Universal Credit' 
  be used to calculate Council Tax Benefit, or will income post-Council Tax Benefit 
  be used to calculate 'Universal Credit'? If the former, because 'Universal Credit' 
  will now be calculated and paid separately and potentially at different amounts 
  every single month using real-time earnings data, Local Authorities will be 
  puzzling over how to calculate a household's Council Tax Benefit; and if the 
  latter, then every Local Authority's computer system will need to relate accurately 
  to the Department for Work and Pensions' system at the same time as HMRC's system 
  is trying to do so. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is just possible 
  that 'Universal Credit' could have worked, and we rather hoped that it would. 
  It would have provided a little more coherence in a chaotic means-tested system, 
  and it would have been a useful step along the way to a Citizen's Income. With 
  Council Tax Benefit being localised at the same time, we are as sure as anyone 
  can be that the Government faces a perfect storm of tax and benefits chaos. 
  David Cameron and George Osborne, having agreed to Council Tax Benefit localisation 
  for political reasons, and to 'Universal Credit' for practical reasons, are 
  now wondering how to extract themselves and their Government from the impending 
  disaster. Moving Iain Duncan Smith from the Department for Work and Pensions 
  so that they could drop 'Universal Credit' was all they could think of. This 
  failed. Their only option now is to abandon Council Tax Benefit localisation. 
  Otherwise they will be rabbits looking into a car's headlamps. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Government 
  has decided that there is no Plan B in relation to reducing the annual public 
  spending deficit. If they do not abandon Council Tax Benefit localisation then 
  they will need to start thinking quite quickly about a plan B to implement when 
  the tax and benefits system collapses. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A template for 
  Plan B would be Child Benefit. No other elements of the tax and benefits system 
  affect how much of it is paid; it never rises or falls with decreased or increased 
  earnings; in proportional terms it benefits non-earners and low earners more 
  than it benefits higher earners; it never contributes to marginal deduction 
  rates and so is never a disincentive to employment; and its administration and 
  computerisation have never been a problem. To extend the principle of Child 
  Benefit to every UK citizen would provide the Government with precisely the 
  policy mix for which it is looking. And an added bonus: to replace 'Universal 
  Credit' with a genuinely universal Citizen's Income would even enable Council 
  Tax Benefit to be localised without too many problems. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We would be happy 
  to advise.</font><br>

  rule-of-thumb basic income model for the UK, with and without an earnings/income 
  disregard: Design and cost your own Basic Income scheme</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">by Anne G. Miller</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>ABSTRACT</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The defining characteristics 
  of a Basic Income (BI), (universal, individual, unconditional, high enough), 
  do not provide the full specification for a working scheme. The methods of monitoring, 
  compliance and delivery, the source of funding, and the actual level(s) of the 
  benefit must be specified. A BI scheme is a set of instruments, rather than 
  a program of policy objectives. Depending on the other instruments with which 
  it is coupled, it could fulfil a variety of welfare objectives. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The novel contributions 
  of this paper are that: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a) it demonstrates 
  how a BI scheme can be designed to fulfil a set of stated objectives according 
  to given priorities, in this case: </font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To redistribute 
    income from rich to poor (and thus from men to women, and geographically).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That the BIs 
    should reflect the prosperity of the economy. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To prevent poverty 
    for financially-vulnerable adults and households with children. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To reduce the 
    incidence of financial poverty of all other working-age adults.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To provide a 
    method of calculating an approximate figure for the standard rate of income 
    tax required to finance a particular scheme.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To provide a 
    benchmark, using Minimum Income Standards for the UK. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To provide a 
    Rule-of-Thumb for the BI levels, to enable quick calculations, and to use 
    as an illustrative example. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To restore incentives 
    for those on Partial BIs (working age adults, who are not financially-vulnerable) 
    to seek paid work.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ensure that 
    the BI system does not lead to a downward spiral of the economy, and that 
    economic cycles are stabilised.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">b) it provides 
  a simple, illustrative Rule-of-Thumb model, with Partial and Full BIs set at 
  proportions 0.25 and 0.50 respectively of mean income per head of man, woman 
  and child (Y-BAR). This simplifies the required calculations. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">c) Table 1 provides 
  a method of costing a BI scheme financed out of a new, restructured, hypothecated 
  income tax system, which for the Rule-of-Thumb model would have a standard rate 
  of 40%. <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">d) Current higher 
  rate tax-payers would lose very little, (5% at the most, and decreasing with 
  gross income), on the introduction of this BI scheme with a standard rate of 
  income tax of 40%.<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">e) It also shows 
  how to construct, develop and cost a progressive element to the income tax schedule 
  (justified on both equity and efficiency grounds), by introducing an initial 
  tax-free tranche of gross income for those who receive Partial BIs, until their 
  net income schedule meets and merges with the Full BI schedule. This variation 
  requires a higher standard rate of income tax. <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">f) It finds that 
  there is a variety of potential levels for the Partial BIs, and the associated 
  income tax rates on the initial tranche of income before the Partial and Full 
  BI schedules meet and merge, without increasing the standard rate of income 
  tax. This offers a remarkable degree of flexibility. <br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">g)Keeping the BIs 
  as fixed proportions of Y-BAR for the term of a government administration provides 
  a self-stabilising mechanism for the economy, and the lagged effects in the 
  system provide fiscal drag and reduce the amplitude of the economic cycles.<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">h) It demonstrates 
  that even fairly generous BI schemes are economically feasible in the UK.<br>
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Disclaimer</b>: 
  This scheme is not necessarily the policy of the Citizen's Income Trust.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Note</b>: The 
  terms 'Basic Income' (BI) and 'Citizen's Income' (CI) will be used interchangeably.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SPECIFICATION 
  OF BENEFIT AND INCOME TAX SYSTEMS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">More than 40 delegates 
  from 14 European countries have been contacting each other, and meeting together, 
  on a regular basis since the autumn of 2011 to prepare, discuss and vote for 
  the final draft of a 'European Citizens' Initiative' (ECI) entitled 'Unconditional 
  Basic Income' (UBI). It asks the European Parliament to do all in its power 
  to speed up the introduction of a UBI in the European Union. The paper lists 
  the defining characteristics of a BI as: 1. universal, 2. individual, 3. unconditional, 
  and 4. high enough to meet one's material needs, in order both to survive and 
  to ensure a life of dignity, together with full participation in society. These 
  represent the key characteristics that are necessary to define an income maintenance 
  system as a Basic Income (BI) scheme, but by themselves do not describe a complete 
  system. For instance, the methods of delivery of the BI, and of monitoring and 
  compliance, and of course, the source for financing the scheme, must be specified. 
  Further, the level(s) or amount(s) of the BI must also be stated. It is in the 
  process of designing the greater system, that these basically simple concepts 
  become part of a potentially complex and technical structure with ramifying 
  consequences, both intended and unintended. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Different sources 
  for funding a BI scheme have been suggested. These include Value Added Tax, 
  the Tobin financial transactions tax, Land Value Tax, Resource Taxes (such as 
  the Dividend from Alaska's Permanent Fund), a carbon tax and other 'green' taxes. 
  However, it is unlikely that any one of these alone could finance a generous 
  enough BI scheme to replace even the current level of benefits in the UK. In 
  the UK, the Citizen's Income Trust has mainly concentrated on exploring funding 
  via an income tax system. The benefit and income tax systems are reverse sides 
  of the same coin, and it is appropriate to consider them together, and that 
  the one should finance the other, providing a 'velvet revolution or circulation 
  of income'. The main features that must be addressed in order to define a benefit 
  and income tax scheme are given below, indicating the particular features that 
  are assumed for a Basic Income scheme.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A. <b>Eligibility</b> 
  states who is entitled and on what basis. The current UK social security system 
  comprises a Social Insurance scheme, where entitlement is according to a set 
  of conditions being fulfilled (maternity, invalidity, sickness, unemployment 
  or retirement) and a contribution record, and a means-tested Social Assistance 
  scheme, which is meant to be a safety net for those in need, who are either 
  deemed to be unable to work, or deemed able to work and are actively seeking 
  work. A Citizen's Income is inclusive of a whole population. Early debates centred 
  on whether the levels of CI would be needs-based (which would lead to much monitoring 
  and selectivity, losing its simplicity, and introducing an element of arbitrariness), 
  or in the form of the same level of Social Dividend from the economy for everyone, 
  on which it may, or may not, be enough to live. A compromise could provide a 
  social dividend that is sufficiently generous to ensure that the needs of the 
  majority of the population were met. The corollary is that some people would 
  receive more than they actually need to survive. A CI would be <b>universal</b> 
  to everyone who is legally resident in the UK, and would not be withdrawable. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">B. Both the benefit 
  and tax units for assessment, and for the receipt of the benefit and/or payment 
  of taxes, will be the <b>individual</b>, and not a couple or household.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">C. <b>Contingency</b> 
  refers to whether pre-conditions must be fulfilled before the recipient becomes 
  entitled to a particular benefit. The Basic Income will be <b>unconditional</b>. 
  The right to the BI will not depend on any preconditions, such as an obligation 
  to work, being involved in community service, or behaving according to traditional 
  gender roles. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">D. <b>Selectivity</b> 
  refers to whether recipients receive different amounts of a benefit based on 
  their personal circumstances. The Basic Income will be <b>non-selective</b>, 
  (except that it could be age-related), and certainly would not vary by race, 
  creed, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, cohabitation, household composition 
  or past work record. Neither would the entitlement be means-tested on the recipient's 
  own income or wealth, nor on that of another member of the household or family.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">E. The<b> amounts 
  of any benefits paid</b> should be compared to an acceptable benchmark. The 
  amount of the BI to be paid to every man and woman could be a <b>Full BI</b>, 
  that would be enough for a single person to live on modestly, allowing participation 
  in society, or a <b>Partial BI</b>, which would have to be topped up by other 
  income, usually earnings, or a <b>Child BI</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">F. A benefit could 
  be delivered in a variety of ways. The BI will be <b>delivered automatically</b> 
  to those who qualify. It could be in the form of a regular gross payment to 
  the account of a named single holder (as opposed to a joint account), including 
  the responsible parent of a dependent child - as now. This is in contrast to 
  a Negative Income Tax (NIT), (a transfer payment net of any lesser income tax 
  due on gross income), or a Tax Credit (TC), (a tax payment payable on gross 
  income net of any lesser benefit due). Some advocates favour a TC system because 
  it is thought that it might make for an easier transition from the current system. 
  The BI payment should be simpler, (and therefore cheaper to administer), than 
  a NIT, TC or the current system, and should ensure that everyone can rely on 
  receiving a regular, predictable income. It involves large gross-transfers of 
  income within society, but the net amount transferred (the total amount of payments 
  paid net by the tax payers, or the total income received by the net recipients) 
  will be much less, and will depend on both the degree of inequality of gross 
  incomes in society at the time and the degree of inequality of net incomes aimed 
  at.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">G. <b>Monitoring 
  and compliance</b>. This includes maintaining a database on the population of 
  citizens, as now. Since the CI system is much simpler, the number of data on 
  each recipient would be much smaller, and thus the total database would be much 
  smaller and cheaper to maintain. However, some monitoring would be necessary, 
  to ensure that each citizen receives only one CI, that s/he is legally resident 
  in the UK, and actually resides where s/he claims.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">H. The <b>income 
  tax system</b> must specify the sources of income to be taxed, and the structure 
  of rates and thresholds, including personal allowances, tax reliefs and exemptions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Appendix A</b> 
  provides a table of some recent basic figures about UK (population, GDP, mean 
  income per head, sample BI levels, current means-tested benefit rates, and income 
  tax thresholds and tax rates) used throughout this exercise, for calendar years 
  2007-2010, and fiscal years 2009-10 to 2012-13, together with their sources.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>POTENTIAL OBJECTIVES</b>:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The defining characteristics 
  of a BI/CI scheme (universal, individual, unconditional, non-selective (except 
  that it could be age-related) and high enough) can help to achieve several related 
  objectives for welfare reform, depending on the level(s) of the BI(s), including 
  the following:</font></p>

    on past National Insurance contribution records;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to remove the 
    stigma and low take-up of means-tested benefits (MTBs), helping to create 
    a more united and inclusive society. </font></li>

    to financial security;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to reduce the 
    current time-consuming personal effort required to apply for benefits.<br>
    </font></li>
</ol>

  Market objectives</b>:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">to restore incentives 
    to work-for-pay and labour market efficiency, by reducing the current high 
    marginal deductions from potential earnings facing unemployed and low-paid 
    workers who claim means-tested benefits, (by removing the aggregated benefit 
    withdrawals that are currently added to income tax liabilities and National 
    Insurance contributions);</font></li>

</ol>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>However, a Citizen's 
  / Basic Income by itself will not redistribute income</b>, reducing income inequalities 
  between rich and poor, men and women, and geographically. For this objective 
  to be achieved, the BI scheme for the UK would have to be financed by a restructured 
  income tax system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Depending on with 
  what other instruments it is coupled, a BI scheme can give rise to a wide variety 
  of welfare systems. When planning a particular scheme, it is safer to start 
  by defining the type of society that one is aiming to create, then specifying 
  which objectives would help to bring about such a society, and finally designing 
  a system that will achieve these objectives. There is no single optimum BI scheme. 
  Each scheme put forward will represent a particular set of priorities for the 
  objectives, and the proposed levels for the BIs, and the proposed method of 
  financing them, will reflect this.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A BI SCHEME 
  DESIGNED TO MEET SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this paper, 
  a modified BI system is explored, since initially it assumes only<b> a universal 
  Partial BI</b>, (although some people will be entitled to be topped up to a 
  Full BI). These <b>tax-exempt BIs </b>will replace most of the current National 
  Insurance (NI) benefits and Means-Tested Benefits (MTBs). The system is then 
  extended in order to address the following particular objectives:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To redistribute 
    income from rich to poor (and thus from men to women, and geographically). 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The BIs should 
    reflect the prosperity of the economy. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To prevent the 
    poverty of financially-vulnerable adults and households with children. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To reduce the 
    incidence of financial poverty of all other working-age adults.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To provide a 
    method of calculating an approximate figure for the standard rate of income 
    tax required to finance a particular scheme (and thus summarising the cost 
    of a particular scheme in terms of a single figure).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To provide a 
    benchmark using Minimum Income Standards for the UK. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To provide a 
    Rule-of-Thumb for the BIs to enable quick calculations, and to use as an illustrative 
    example. </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To restore incentives 
    to work-for-pay for working age adults on Partial BIs.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ensure that 
    the BI system does not lead to a downward spiral of the economy, and that 
    economic cycles are stabilised. </font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. In order to<b> 
  redistribute income from rich to poor</b>, the BI scheme will be financed by 
  a new, restructured, hypothecated, <b>proportional (flat-rate) or progressive 
  income tax system</b>, still based on the individual, (replacing both the current 
  UK income tax and employees' National Insurance contributions systems), with 
  the following properties: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a. There will be 
  no personal allowances, tax reliefs or exemptions, (tax loopholes which enable 
  legal tax avoidance to occur, and which subsidise the wealthier sections of 
  the nation); </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">b. The same rate 
  of tax will be levied on all sources of income: wages and salaries from full-time 
  and part-time employment, earnings from self-employment, share schemes and options, 
  company perquisites (perks), pensions, interest and dividends, capital gains, 
  rental income and gifts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fact that the 
  income tax system is hypothecated and is used to finance only the transfer payments 
  and associated expenditure, implies that it will be simple, introducing transparency, 
  and therefore accountability. It also implies that there will be a standard 
  rate of income tax that will be required to finance the BI scheme, together 
  with a margin for administration, a safety net, costs of disabilities, and other 
  associated costs. It also implies that all government expenditure, (as opposed 
  to transfer payments), will be funded out of the revenue from other income and 
  expenditure taxes. This is feasible in the UK. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Redistribution 
  from rich to poor will also bring about redistribution from men to women within 
  a household, and from areas of the country that are thriving to those that are 
  deprived. This latter could help to regenerate economically deprived areas and, 
  in time, build up the national economy so that the UK is less dependent on imports 
  and exports.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The amount of 
  the BIs <b>should reflect the prosperity of the economy</b>. In spite of the 
  inadequacies of GDP as a measure of economic activity, expressing the Full, 
  Partial and Child BIs for each country as <b>proportions of GDP <i>per capita</i></b>, 
  based on the most recent figures available, would enable international comparisons 
  to be made as to the generosity of a particular scheme. However, in order to 
  calculate the cost of the scheme in terms of a flat-rate income tax, the BIs 
  would have to be expressed as<b> proportions of average (mean) income per capita, 
  Y-BAR</b>, of man, woman and child, based on the most recent figures available. 
  In the UK, this would be for the calendar year ending fifteen months before 
  the intended benefit period or fiscal year. (A Y with a bar across the top is 
  a common symbol for mean income). Mean income per head amounted to between 74 
  and 77% of GDP per head in the years 2007 - 10 and was declining. The sources 
  of the difference between GDP at market prices (series <font size="1">YBHA</font>) 
  and 'Total Resources of Households and Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households' 
  (series <font size="1">QWMF</font>) can be examined by a comparison of Table 
  1.2 (income component method) and Table 6.1.3 of the UK National Accounts, (The 
  Blue Book). The major item is 'Taxes on production and imports (series <font size="1">NZGX</font>), 
  less subsidies ( - series <font size="1">AAXS</font>)'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. To<b> prevent 
  poverty in financially-vulnerable adults and households with children</b>: the 
  financially vulnerable adults are groups that in a compassionate society would 
  not be compelled to top up a Partial BI with earnings, and so will receive an 
  extra amount of BI to make up their Partial BI to a <b>Full BI</b>, which the 
  recipients could increase further with earnings, if they wished. Financially-vulnerable 
  adults will comprise people above pension-entitlement age, those with disabilities, 
  unpaid designated carers-of-last-resort, and the responsible parent of a dependent 
  child (aged 0-15 inclusive, in the UK). These are not necessarily mutually exclusive 
  groups. The financially-vulnerable groups would not receive their top-ups on 
  account of desert or worth, ie because they are more deserving, but merely on 
  the practical basis that it is usually more difficult for these groups to gain 
  access to the labour market on equal terms with the other working-age adults. 
  People with disabilities will receive <b>tax-exempt payments to cover the costs 
  of their disabilities</b> (for care, mobility, special equipment, special diets, 
  extra fuel, extra laundry, etc.), in addition to their Full BIs. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. <b>To help to 
  reduce the incidence of financial poverty of all other adults of working-age</b>: 
  they will receive their <b>Partial BI</b>, and would be expected to top it up 
  with earnings, but a safety net (probably of an individualised, means-tested, 
  unified Housing-and-Council-Tax-Benefit) would have to be retained for those 
  who were in economically depressed areas, where there was a shortage of paid 
  work, and for those in other areas who were unable to find suitable paid employment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. <b>To provide 
  a method of calculating an approximate figure </b>for the standard rate of income 
  tax to finance a particular BI scheme (and thus summarising the cost of a particular 
  scheme in terms of a single figure).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Table 1 below illustrates 
  the method that can be used to estimate an approximate figure for the rate of 
  income tax that would have been required to finance a given Basic Income scheme. 
  It is based on the 2010 figures for population and income (Total Resources of 
  Households and Non-Profit Institutions Serving Households). Column 2 gives the 
  figures (or estimates from other sources) for the different sections of the 
  population, which are expressed as proportions of the total population for the 
  UK in column 3. Let the Partial and Full BIs be expressed as given proportions 
  of Y-BAR, and let the Y-BAR figure from 2010 (&pound;17,288 pa) be used to calculate 
  the Partial and Full BIs to be distributed in the fiscal year 2012-13. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Table 1 below illustrates 
  a simple version where Partial BI = Child BI = 0.25 of Y-BAR, and Full BI = 
  0.50 of Y-BAR from 2010. The proposed proportions of Y-BAR for the BIs are noted 
  in column 4. Columns 5 and 6 contain the amounts that the FBI, PBI and CBI represent 
  in annual and weekly figures, (which would then be implemented in the fiscal 
  year 2012-13). The product of columns 3 and 4 is noted in column 7. The fifth 
  row of column 7 gives the cost for the whole population, man, woman and child 
  to receive a Partial BI of 0.25 of Y-BAR, and this gives a base figure for the 
  income tax rate of 25%. On each of the subsequent rows, the extra amount that 
  each of the groups who receive a Full BI contributes to the required total income 
  tax rate, (or the amount that could be deducted by giving less to children, 
  as is often proposed in CI schemes), can be easily calculated and is noted in 
  column 7. This also makes it easy to calculate the cost of increasing or decreasing 
  a BI for a particular group. The table could have been laid out differently, 
  giving each group a separate row. The figures in column 7 are added to give 
  the TOTAL.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A figure has been 
  added to estimate the payments required to cover the cost of disabilities, and 
  <b>a margin</b> has been added to cover <b>administration costs</b> and a<b> 
  safety-net</b>: for those in poverty, in spite of the BI scheme; to cover a 
  residual National Insurance scheme for those not eligible for a BI in UK (ie. 
  those living abroad); to provide a social fund for emergency payments. The flat-rate 
  tax required to finance this scheme would be 40%.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. To <b>provide 
  a benchmark, using Minimum Income Standards</b>. An early official benchmark 
  was based on <b>0.6 of average earnings</b>. However, earnings are difficult 
  to define: whose earnings are used to define the population, does it include 
  that of part-time workers and over-time workers, those who are currently out 
  of work, or those who have never worked? This was then replaced by <b>0.5 of 
  average income</b>. However, the current official poverty benchmark for the 
  European Union is given as <b>0.6 of the national median net household equivalent 
  income</b>, which was found to be almost co-incidental with 0.5 of average income. 
  This is a very confusing benchmark. The first point is that the 'net household 
  equivalent' implies that it has already been decided what the equivalent amounts 
  for members of the household should be, and that those household members had 
  access to the incomes with which they are imputed. It can be very difficult 
  to find out exactly how this benchmark has been calculated, and different teams 
  seem to use different methods. It is not at all transparent. As a benchmark 
  for a BI scheme, based on the individual, the only relevant figure to use would 
  be <b>0.6 of median gross income</b>, where median income had been calculated 
  from the distribution of the gross (pre-tax-and-benefit) non-equivalised incomes 
  of all the individuals in the country, at the point where there are as many 
  individuals receiving more than the median income, as those below it, including 
  those with zero gross incomes. </font></p>

</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using 
  this new benchmark, a simple BI scheme for the benefit year 2009-10 was designed 
  (Miller, 2009), which would provide a Full BI for financially-vulnerable adults, 
  a Partial BI for other adults of working age, and a Child BI, which enabled 
  all financially vulnerable adults and all households with children, (whether 
  headed by a single parent or by two parents) to attain their LCA income. Each 
  parent would receive a BI that is independent of whether they are living with 
  or without another adult. (The present benefit system, based on joint applications, 
  penalises parents who live together). The amount for each BI was then expressed 
  as a proportion of mean income per head of man, woman and child (Y-BAR) for 
  the calendar year 2007, (Office of National Statistics, <i>Blue Book</i>, 2008 
  edition). The proportions for the FBI, PBI and CBI came to 0.56, 026 and 0.26 
  of Y-BAR respectively. Unexpectedly, the PBI and CBI came to the same amounts. 
  Comparing column 5 with columns 1 and 6 of Table 2 reveals how successful the 
  scheme is at meeting the objectives of protecting financially-vulnerable adults 
  and households with children.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. To provide a 
  <b>rule-of-thumb to enable quick calculations, and to use as an illustrative 
  exampl</b>e. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <b>first rule 
  of thumb p</b>rovides that the <b>Partial BI</b> <b>and Child BI are equal</b>, 
  (and this gives the basis for a Partial BI for everyone), and that the <b>Full 
  BI is twice the Partial BI</b>. But, what should be the amounts for the BIs, 
  and at what rate of income tax?</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using the method 
  in Table 1, the required income tax rates were calculated for a range of BI 
  schemes, where the Full BI lay between 0.30 and 0.60 of Y-BAR. (Table 3 gives 
  part of these results, which also includes the original MIS-based scheme. The 
  Full BI = 0.55 and Partial BI = 0.275 Y-BAR matched up with it very well). The 
  added margin diminished as the scheme became more generous, on the assumption 
  that the need for the safety net would become less as the scheme became more 
  generous. The corresponding required tax rates lay between 0.28 and 0.46. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On examining the 
  amounts of the BIs and the corresponding tax rates, it was found that the range 
  for the FBI of 0.45 &lt; FBI &lt; 0.55, with 0.225 &lt; PBI &lt; 0.275, gave 
  feasible values for the BIs. In other words, the amounts of the BIs should be 
  within this range. The corresponding income tax rate, t, would be 0.37 &lt; 
  t &lt; 0.43. Table 3 also shows which households would receive more than their 
  Minimum Income Standard, and which ones would receive less, for the different 
  levels of Basic Income. It was noted that the scheme where FBI = 0.43, PBI = 
  0.215 Y-BAR and t = 0.35 matches up with the amounts for the means-tested Pension 
  Credit and the Jobseeker's Allowance chosen by the Department of Work and Pensions 
  for the 2012-13 fiscal year in the UK. The approach taken here is for the Full 
  BI for the financially-vulnerable groups to be sufficiently high so that the 
  majority of them can meet their needs, but the corollary of this is that others 
  may receive more than they strictly need. Those receiving only a PBI would only 
  be able to live on it by topping it up via earnings, or by living within a family, 
  or by receiving a Housing-and-Council Tax Benefit.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>A second rule 
  of thumb </b>proposes that the <b>Full, Partial and Child CIs are 0.50, 0.25 
  and 0.25 of average income per head (Y-BAR) respectively</b>, and that these 
  amounts can be used for illustrative purposes and has the extra advantage of 
  providing easy calculations. The calculated tax rate was 40%. The graph of net 
  income plotted against gross income gives two parallel lines with an inclination 
  of 0.60. (See Figure 1) A recipient of the higher Full BI in 2012-13 would not 
  become a net tax-payer until a gross annual income of &pound;21,610 is reached, 
  and s/he will have a greater net income than under the single person's current 
  income tax schedule for 2012-13, over the whole range of gross income. A recipient 
  of the lower Partial BI becomes a net tax-payer at a gross income of &pound;10,805 
  and becomes worse off compared with the 2012-13 income tax system, at a gross 
  income of &pound;21,613. These BIs are slightly less than those devised from 
  the benchmarks provided by the <i>Minimum Income Standards</i> for those with 
  no source of income other than their BI. The downside of proposing this rule 
  of thumb is that, if one relaxes the benchmark of the MIS, then there is a temptation 
  for others to reduce the levels even more.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While an income 
  tax rate of 40% might sound quite high, it is economically feasible. Those above 
  the higher rate tax threshold have already been paying a slightly higher Marginal 
  Deduction Rate (effective income tax rate) than this in 2011-12 and in 2012-13, 
  (40% income tax plus 2% employees' National Insurance contributions on gross 
  incomes of &pound;42,475 or more). On the other hand, many people on means-tested-benefits, 
  who are trying to earn their way out of poverty, not only have to pay income 
  tax of 20% and National Insurance of 12%, but often face multiple benefit-withdrawal 
  rates leading to a Marginal Deduction Rate of nearly 96%. The proposed introduction 
  of a new Universal Credit system in 2013 aims to reduce these levels to 76 and 
  65%, depending on whether one's income is above or below the personal allowance 
  (income tax threshold) respectively. The greater reduction in Marginal Deduction 
  Rates for people on low incomes from 96% to only 40% in this BI scheme is a 
  major achievement, and most of those people will be materially better off with 
  this BI scheme than under the present system, especially with the retention 
  of a residual Housing Benefit scheme. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A non-financially-vulnerable, 
  working-age person would have lost only &pound;1,669.60 in net income at the 
  current higher income tax threshold (&pound;42,475 in tax year 2012-13), if 
  this BI had been introduced, (retaining &pound;31,476.60 under the current 2012-13 
  income tax schedule, and &pound;29,807 with the Partial BI). This represents 
  a loss of 0.053 of his/her net income. As his/her gross income, Y, increases, 
  the loss = &pound;31,476.60 + 0.58(Y - &pound;42,475) - (&pound;29,807 + 0.60(Y 
  - &pound;42.475)) = &pound;1,669.60 + (0.58 - 0.60) (Y - &pound;42,475), and 
  decreases as gross income Y increases, until gross income Y = &pound;83,480 
  + &pound;42,475 = &pound;125,955, when one becomes better off under the Partial 
  BI scheme than the current tax system. Higher rate tax-payers would lose very 
  little on the introduction of this BI scheme with a standard rate of income 
  tax of 40%. In fact, at this rate of income tax it is quite difficult to ensure 
  that they do not benefit unduly from the introduction of a universal BI that 
  is paid to the wealthy. This counter-intuitive outcome can most probably be 
  best described as equivalent to the current tax expenditures, that occurred 
  on account of the tax loopholes, being 'reclaimed' by the tax authorities and 
  distributed more equally among the wealthier section of the population in the 
  form of a BI. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even a proportional 
  tax linked with a BI scheme can be very redistributive. For instance, it can 
  be shown that for a skewed distribution of gross income with a given Gini coefficient 
  (a measure of inequality of a distribution that can take values between 0 (equally 
  distributed) and 1 (the most unequal that it can be)), a proportional income 
  tax rate of t = &szlig;, where 0 &lt; &szlig; &lt; 1, coupled with a BI = &szlig;.Y-BAR, 
  yields a net income distribution with the Gini coefficient reduced by &szlig;. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This costing method 
  has the advantage of providing a single figure to summarise the gross cost. 
  A progressive tax schedule will redistribute income to an even greater extent, 
  but it is much more difficult to calculate its gross cost, because it usually 
  requires information about the distribution of the gross income. Costing a proposed 
  BI scheme based on a proportional tax would not preclude a government of the 
  day from implementing a progressive income tax system when the time came. However, 
  a flat-rate tax might reduce the opposition to a BI scheme from current and 
  aspiring higher-rate taxpayers.</font></p>

  incentives to work-for-pay, via an earnings/income disregard, for adults of 
  working age who are not financially-vulnerable and who are receiving Partial 
  BIs</b>. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the strange 
  effects of any BI scheme which includes both a FBI and a PBI, and where every 
  one pays the same rate of tax on all other sources of income, is that the graph 
  of net income plotted against gross income reveals the two schedules to be parallel 
  lines over the whole range of gross income. (See figure 1.) This implies that, 
  at any given gross income, a financially-vulnerable adult will always require 
  the same amount extra of net income than any other working-age adult receiving 
  a PBI. Yet, on both equity and efficiency grounds, it would be preferable for 
  there to be an <b>earnings/income disregard (EDR) (zero tax-rate)</b> for each 
  person receiving the Partial BI, until his/her net income schedule meets and 
  merges with the Full BI schedule. This introduces an element of progressivity 
  into the Partial BI tax schedule. Since this second, more progressive, Partial 
  BI schedule foregoes all of the income tax revenue from the first tranche of 
  income, it is more expensive to finance. In fact, it can be almost as expensive 
  as granting a Full BI to all adults.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let us assume that 
  there is a BI scheme, comprising a Full BI = &szlig;F.Y-BAR for all N adults, 
  requiring a standard rate of income tax of tF. Then the scheme is modified, 
  and C adults, C &lt; N, receive a Partial BI = &szlig;P.Y-BAR, where &szlig;P 
  &lt; &szlig;F. An income tax rate, tP, where 0 &lt; tP &lt; tF, is levied on 
  the first tranche of their gross income, until the Partial BI income tax schedule 
  meets and merges with the Full BI schedule, where gross income is Yo. </font></p>

  Y-BAR x C.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(3) The <b>actual 
  </b>income tax revenue foregone, by the introduction of the Partial BI and lower 
  tax rate on the first tranche of income, is the difference between the sums 
  of the tax revenue foregone on incomes, YiF, at income tax rate, tF, and that 
  gained from the incomes, YiP, taxed at the new rate tP, summed over the Partial 
  BI population, i = 1, 2, &#133; C. Both the lower BI, and the lower tax rate, 
  tP, should provide incentives for people to increase their hours of work-for-pay, 
  that is: 0 ? YiF ? YiP ? Yo and total output could increase as a result.</font></p>

  Y-BAR x C.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Equations (1), 
  (2) and (3a) imply that, the amount saved by granting a lower BI to some people 
  will equal the<b> maximum</b> possible tax revenue foregone on the first tranche, 
  Yo, of their Partial BI income tax schedule, where the Partial and Full BI schedules 
  meet and merge, and this is true for any combination of &szlig;F &gt; &szlig;P 
  , and is not dependent on the difference in the two tax rates. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The fact that the 
  actual tax revenue foregone is less than or equal to maximum revenue foregone, 
  implies that the actual required standard income tax rate to fund the scheme 
  will not be more than the initial required tax rate, tF, and could even be less, 
  depending on the distribution of the incomes 0 ? YiF ? YiP ? Yo,, over the first 
  tranche.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These two statements 
  are quite powerful in practical terms. One of the potential weaknesses of the 
  rule-of-thumb BI scheme put forward here is that the Partial BI = 0.25 Y-BAR 
  could leave some working-age adults in poverty. The conclusion above means that 
  a higher level of Partial BI could be granted, with either a zero or a positive 
  tax rate, (tP &lt; tF), and according to equations (1), (2) and (3a), it will 
  cost the same in terms of the maximum gross transfer bill, or less in terms 
  of the actual gross transfer bill. See Table 4 below for some examples. However, 
  The effects on households of increasing the Partial BIs should be examined by 
  comparing them with the Minimum Income Standards presented in Table 2.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note, even a proportional 
  tax linked with a BI scheme can be very redistributive. However, a progressive 
  tax schedule will redistribute income to an even greater extent. Having a zero 
  tax rate on the initial tranche of gross income introduces a simple method of 
  making the income tax schedule progressive for at least some people. </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
  the Rule-of-Thumb example, the product of the proportion (approximately 0.4) 
  of the total population who receive a PBI, multiplied by an increase in the 
  PBI to a FBI (0.25 Y-BAR) is 0.10 Y-BAR, which added to the previous income 
  tax rate of 0.40 Y-BAR, implies that this BI scheme could be financed adequately 
  by an<b> income tax rate of 50%</b>, (tF = 0.50), which is probably the maximum 
  that the UK could stomach as the standard rate of tax. (See Table 3 above) </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Equation 1) above 
  gives </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yo = (&szlig;F 
  - &szlig;P)Y-BAR / (tF - tP)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Substituting for 
  &szlig;F = 0.50, &szlig;P = 0.25, tF=0.5 and tP=0 </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Yo = (0.50 - 0.25) 
  Y-BAR / (0.5 - 0) = 0.5 Y-BAR</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The key features 
  of this illustrative Rule of Thumb BI scheme are very easy to work out. The 
  Full and Partial BI schedules will meet when gross income, Yo, reaches 0.5 of 
  Y-BAR, at which point, net income will be 0.75 of Y-BAR. A working-age adult 
  receiving a Partial BI will only<b> start to pay income tax </b>when his/her 
  annual gross income exceeds 0.5 of Y-BAR. Further, no adult will become a <b>net 
  income tax payer</b> until his/her income is greater than Y-BAR. (See Figure 
  2. Figure 3 combines figures 1 and 2.) Almost all of those with a gross income 
  less than &pound;33,613, (which is almost twice Y-BAR from 2010), would be <b>better 
  off with the BI scheme</b> than under the current 2012-13 income tax schedule.</font><br>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Might this be a 
  simple but useful way to define the richer and poorer sections of the nation: 
  a 'poorer' person is one who receives a net benefit, while a 'richer' person 
  is one who pays net income tax, ie. defined by whether their gross income is 
  less or greater than Y-BAR? This is distinct from the super 1% richest of the 
  population, or even the top 10%. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If this BI scheme 
  had been introduced, then at the higher income tax threshold (&pound;42,475 
  in 2012-13), the loss experienced by a tax-payer would be: loss = &pound;8,105 
  + 0.68 (&pound;42.475 - &pound;8,105) - (&pound;8,644 + 0.50 (&pound;42,475)) 
  = &pound;1,595.10. This represents 5% of his/her net income. As gross income, 
  Y, increases, the loss = &pound;31.476.60 + 0.58 (Y - &pound;42,475) - (&pound;29,881.50 
  + 0.5 (Y - &pound;42,475)) = &pound;1595.10 + 0.08 (Y - &pound;42.475) and it 
  increases as gross income increases. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At a gross income 
  of &pound;100,000, the loss is &pound;6,197.10, or 9.6% of net income. At a 
  gross income of &pound;100,000, the personal allowance (&pound;8.105) is withdrawn 
  at a rate of 50%. An additional tax amounting to 50% is levied at the threshold 
  of &pound;150,000. However, this is merely a short-term situation, since the 
  UK government plans to cut the additional tax to 45% in the tax year 2013-14. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Again, an income 
  tax rate of 50% to finance the BI scheme may seem high, but it is still much 
  lower than the current marginal deduction rates (MDRs) facing those who try 
  to return to work while receiving means-tested benefits. A reduction of the 
  MDR from nearly 96% to 0% on the first tranche of income (of 0.5 of Y-BAR) for 
  those receiving a PBI is a major achievement. Those who are currently expected 
  to pay &quot;the additional income tax rate&quot; of 50% (plus 2% National Insurance 
  on earnings), could hardly demur at paying 50%, if all citizens, except the 
  poorest working-age adults, paid the same rate. A universal, non-stigmatising 
  BI scheme based on citizenship (rather than need), and a common tax rate will 
  help to create a very inclusive society. Income tax at 50% is the price for 
  creating and maintaining a compassionate, inclusive and harmonious society. 
  It is analogous to &quot;One hand for the ship and one hand for oneself&quot;. 
  Again, this rate might sound very high, but if the idea is repeated often enough, 
  it becomes more familiar, acceptable and realistic.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is often claimed 
  that most people would not be prepared to pay a high marginal income tax rate 
  (of 50%) by choice. But, might they do so, if they could be convinced that they 
  will be better off? In the <b>2010-11 fiscal year</b>, (the latest year for 
  which income tax figures are available), some 300,000 people paid the additional 
  income tax rate of 50%, and about 4 million paid the higher rate tax. Just to 
  give an approximate figure, roughly another 28 million people were standard 
  rate tax-payers, with gross incomes of between &pound;6,475 and &pound;43,875. 
  About 4/5 of the way along this range is the point where people would have become 
  worse off under the BI scheme at a gross income of &pound;36,620 in 2010-11, 
  so perhaps another 6 million standard rate tax payers would be worse off, (but 
  for some, other members of their families could be better off, leaving themselves 
  with more in their own pockets). It is possible that, given the extremely skewed 
  nature of the gross income distribution in the UK, only about 10 million people 
  out of 50 million potential voters would have been worse off in 2010-11, with 
  the rule-of-thumb BI model described above, and some, possibly many, might be 
  prepared to accept a higher income tax rate, if they thought that it would help 
  to create a fairer, more inclusive society in which they themselves and their 
  loved ones, especially financially insecure younger members of their families, 
  could benefit.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of course, the 
  question also arises as to whether children receiving their Partial or Child 
  BI should also be entitled to the earnings / income disregard, thus allowing 
  them to earn from paper rounds or Saturday jobs without having to submit tax 
  returns. There are two differences between children and adults being entitled 
  to a tax-free tranche: (i) the income of children in aggregate is negligible, 
  and so, therefore, is the income tax revenue foregone; and (ii) wealthy parents 
  might be tempted to allocate some of their income to their children to extend 
  their own tax-free earnings / income disregard. How much would be the extra 
  income tax revenue foregone? What constraints, if any, should be placed on this 
  tendency? </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9. <b>Ensure that 
  the BI system does not lead to a downward spiral of the economy</b>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is sometimes 
  feared that when people first receive a BI, it will provide a large disincentive 
  against their taking, or increasing, paid employment, and the economy will become 
  less productive. However, the incentive to take paid employment comprises two 
  parts: the income effect (the unearned income, which will have increased, will 
  be a disincentive), and the substitution effect (the Marginal Deduction Rate 
  or effective tax rate - decreased for many). However, the changes that take 
  place will be as much an effect of the system that is being replaced as of the 
  new one. Many will experience incentives to seek paid employment, or increase 
  their hours of work, whereas others may prefer to reduce their hours. Not only 
  will there be a redistribution of income, but it is likely that there will be 
  a redistribution of hours of work-for-pay, and, indeed, of unpaid work. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is also feared 
  that a significant number from the wealthier section of society will emigrate, 
  taking their job-creation schemes with them, - or at least threatening to do 
  so. The UK, being politically stable and with a temperate climate, is a very 
  attractive place in which many wealthy foreigners wish to reside, even without 
  tax loopholes and other government incentives to persuade them. It is the government's 
  job to protect all of its people, but especially the poorest, who are unable 
  to protect themselves, and it should not submit to blackmail from people who 
  are not committed to contributing to an inclusive society. It should not be 
  a matter of regret if some wealthy people decide to leave. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let the Full and 
  Partial BIs be fixed proportions of Y-BAR. If the labour supply schedule shifted 
  leftwards (ie reduced labour supply), on the introduction of a BI scheme, as 
  a result of the disincentive effect outweighing the incentive effect, and Y-BAR 
  decreased, then the BI in the next time period would decrease also, the labour 
  supply schedule would shift to the right, thus acting as a self-stabilising 
  mechanism, preventing any tendency towards a downward spiral of the economy. 
  If the BIs are sufficiently generous in the first place, then small reductions 
  in the amount could be tolerated. Similarly, if there were a leftward shift 
  in the labour demand schedule (ie reduced demand for labour) due to external 
  factors, again leading to a reduction in Y-BAR, there would be decreased BIs 
  in the next time period, increasing the incentives to work-for-pay, and shifting 
  the labour supply schedule to the right. It is important that <b>the BIs remain 
  as fixed proportions of Y-BAR</b>, for at least the term of a government's administration, 
  (and should be announced in each party's manifesto beforehand), or this important 
  stabilising effect will be lost.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another important 
  outcome of pegging the proportions for a fixed period is that it will create 
  fiscal drag. The lag resulting from the BIs being distributed in the current 
  fiscal period, but being based on Y-BAR from the calendar year ending at least 
  15 months earlier, will provide a slight fiscal drag, which will provide a stabilising 
  influence on the country's economic cycles by reducing their amplitude. This 
  lag will reduce demand when Y-BAR is increasing, and increase demand when Y-BAR 
  is diminishing, in much the same way that the present benefit and income tax 
  systems interact. A prudent government would keep enough reserves to cover the 
  cost of the BIs, in case the economy declines, as did GDP in the UK by 3.76% 
  in monetary terms between 2008 and 2009.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While an analysis 
  of the intended redistributive, and labour market, effects has not yet been 
  carried out, the Basic Income scheme put forward here is designed to redistribute 
  income from rich to poor, to restore incentives to work for the poorest members 
  of society, and to provide a level playing field (all paying the same maximum 
  rate of tax) for everyone else.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This exercise has 
  demonstrated several things. Each person has his/her own ideas about the specific 
  BI system that s/he would like to see implemented, because, in addition to the 
  inclusion of the defining criteria for the BI with their associated advantages, 
  each person has a different set of priorities with respect to other aspects 
  of society and the economy. There is no single, optimum BI system. It has been 
  demonstrated here that one can design and cost one's own ideal scheme, and experiment 
  with variations.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In order to fulfil 
  my list of stated objectives, I have designed a universal, individual-based, 
  unconditional, tax-exempt Partial BI scheme,</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. that is financed 
  out of a hypothecated new income tax system, replacing the current income tax 
  and employees' National Insurance contribution systems;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. where all BIs 
  are stated as proportions of average (mean) income per head, Y-BAR;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. where financially-vulnerable 
  adults are topped up to a tax-exempt Full BI; a tax-exempt payment to cover 
  the cost of disabilities is paid in addition;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. where all those 
  receiving a Partial BI would have recourse to a safety net, if necessary;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. where a method 
  is provided for calculating an approximate figure for the rate of income tax 
  required to finance the scheme. This can be calculated for any BI scheme, whether 
  or not the government is likely to introduce such an income tax system;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. where Minimum 
  Income Standards provide a benchmark;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. with a Rule-of-Thumb, 
  where Partial BI = 0.25, and Full BI = 0.50 of Y-BAR respectively, and the required 
  rate of income tax is 40%;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">8. where adult 
  recipients of the Partial BI have an earnings/income disregard (zero tax rate) 
  until the Partial BI income tax schedule meets and merges with the Full BI schedule, 
  when gross income, Yo is 0.50 of Y-BAR, and net income is 0.75 of Y-BAR. The 
  required standard rate of income tax is 50%. This provides an illustrative example 
  with easy calculations. However, it was demonstrated that a variety of levels 
  of the Partial BI, and associated income tax concessions on the first tranche 
  of gross income, Yo, could be operated without increasing the standard income 
  tax rate. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9. where the proportions 
  of Y-BAR for the BIs are fixed for the term of administration of a government, 
  to provide a self-stabilising adjustment mechanism, and to reduce the amplitude 
  of economic cycles.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have also demonstrated 
  that a reasonably generous BI scheme is economically feasible in the UK. Any 
  new scheme would need to be monitored, to confirm that it meets the stated objectives. 
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have not dealt 
  with the problem of the provision of social-care, or of day-care for the responsible 
  parent of a dependent child, who wishes to engage in paid employment, nor with 
  any unintended consequences, such as changes in illegal immigration, the birth-rate, 
  environmental effects, or possible inflation. Nor have I calculated the potential 
  savings that could be obtained from the additional beneficial effects of a BI 
  scheme, leading to reductions in the costs of different social programs, including 
  a healthier, more trustworthy/trusting society. As with all things, not only 
  is prevention cheaper than cure, but the prevention of poverty represents a 
  real investment in society and the economy. Of course, the specification of 
  a 'better society' is not complete, and needs to include other instruments, 
  such as the provision of education, health services, social housing and public 
  transport. Countries that do not provide universal health and education services 
  as we do in the UK, may wish to provide more generous BI levels than the Rule 
  of Thumb ones proposed here.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is worth reflecting 
  that income inequality in the UK has increased from a Gini coefficient of 0.25 
  in 1979 to 0.34 in 1990, with further increases over the next 20 years to 0.36 
  (Cribb et al, 2012, p.36). The effect of a high degree of inequality on a society 
  can be illustrated by a simple baby-sitting bean group. If one or two households 
  have a low propensity for going out, but carry out lots of baby-sitting, they 
  will accumulate a large stock of beans, and eventually refuse to carry out more 
  baby-sitting. Meanwhile, the rest of the group, in hoc to the bean hoarders, 
  with a reduced aggregate set of beans between them, will be scrabbling about, 
  trying to earn beans by baby-sitting, in order to be able to go out themselves. 
  When the group gets to this stage, if there is not a redistribution of beans, 
  then the group often breaks up. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Basic Income 
  scheme is not a panacea to cure all ills, but it is a necessary, although not 
  sufficient, condition for a 'better society'.</font></p>

  Commons Gathering at Notre Dame University in the United States last October 
  <b>James Quilligan</b>, who has recently spoken at a series of seminars in London, 
  proposed a Great Lakes Commons Trust and Community Bank. 'Bioregional trusts 
  are an emerging horizon in environmental sustainability and financial stability 
  for the people of a common resource area. &#133; The purpose of a bioregional 
  trust is to safeguard a resource for future generations. Just as some communities 
  across the world have become adept at preserving, creating and replenishing 
  their local commons, bioregional trusts can also apply the principles of subsidiarity, 
  polycentricity and inclusive decision-making to the protection and production 
  of resources that are shared on a broader scale. Integrative commons management 
  contributes not only to a clean and healthy biological environment, but also 
  to people's social well-being. In addition, a bioregional trust may generate 
  funds which could be used for ecological restoration as well as a basic income 
  for the people of a region. </font></p>

  the BIEN Congress 2012, Munich, 14th to 16th September</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">by Malcolm Torry</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BIEN now stands 
  for 'Basic Income Earth Network'. Once every two years BIEN holds a congress, 
  and this year's showed just how appropriate the name now is and how inappropriate 
  it would be to still call it the 'Basic Income European Network'. There were 
  participants from South Africa, Namibia, India, Japan, South Korea, the United 
  States, Canada, Latin America, and numerous European countries. Over three hundred 
  in all gathered for forty-eight hours of plenary sessions, workshops and panels: 
  often six different workshops and panels at one time, with three or four speakers 
  each, to enable all of the papers to be delivered and discussed. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The congress was 
  titled 'Pathways to a Basic Income'. There was a sort of pattern to the timetable. 
  Friday's sessions were largely on the current state of the debate, Saturday 
  on routes towards implementation of a Citizen's Income, and Sunday on a Citizen's 
  Income's relationships with such vital themes as ecology, rights, justice, and 
  democracy: but nothing is that tidy, and each day contained a wide diversity 
  of presentations and discussions touching on all of those areas. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The high point 
  was a set of presentations by Guy Standing and representatives of India's Self 
  Employed Workers Association on the Indian Universal Cash Transfers pilot project 
  and on some of the interim results. Of all of the sessions that I attended this 
  one got by far the longest applause. The other high point, though a rather lower 
  key presentation, was the significant story of Iran's Citizen's Income told 
  by Hamid Tabatabai during one of the panel sessions. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Congress was 
  a quite inspiring mixture of the visionary and the realistic, of the broad-brush 
  and the detailed, of the theoretical and the practical, and Germany's Netzwerk 
  Grundeinkommen (Basic Income Network) is to be congratulated on organising such 
  a highly successful event.</font><br>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr Marc de Basquiat 
  has employed microsimulation software and a household budget survey (named MAUF-MS) 
  of 823,815 individuals aged 18 and above grouped in 458,584 households to calculate

  Birnbaum, <i>Basic income Reconsidered: Social justice, liberalism, and the 
  demands of equality</i>, </font></b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Palgrave 
  Macmillan, 2012, xii + 246 pp, hbk, 0 230 11406 7, &pound;62.50<br>
  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">'Radical 
  liberalism ... holds a substantial universal and unconditional tier of social 
  rights to be one of the ideal requirements of liberal-egalitarian justice.' 
  (p.8) Equality and freedom can and should be pursued at the same time, a universalist 
  welfare state is the means to this combination, and an important element of 
  such a welfare state is a Citizen's Income. This is the agenda that Birnbaum 
  has pursued through the research project of which this book is the outcome: 
  an agenda with which he constantly contrasts more conditional forms of welfare 
  state based on ideas of 'reciprocity'.<br>
  </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">In 
  his introductory chapter, Birnbaum locates his treatment between the quite general 
  theorizing of John Rawls and an empirical approach more concerned with feasibility: 
  'between' in the sense that his 'feasibility' takes the long view and does not 
  allow short term political realities to determine feasibility in the longer 
  term, and in the sense that his method is one of 'reflective equilibrium': a 
  moving backwards and forwards between different propositions in an attempt to 
  resolve contradictions.<br>
  </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">In 
  Rawlsian fashion, the first part of the book argues for a Citizen's Income on 
  the basis that it maximises the economic prospects of the least advantaged member 
  of society more effectively than would more conditional benefits systems. The 
  second part answers the objection that a Citizen's Income requires taxation 
  and therefore exploits workers. Birbaum follows Philippe Van Parijs in showing 
  that much of the income earned through employment is the result of resources 
  that belong to all of us, and that taxing earned income is therefore a redistribution 
  of gifts. The argument is then extended to jobs: if <i>they</i> are gifts, then 
  everyone has a claim on their value. <br>
  </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">The 
  third part of the book tackles feasibility. Birnbaum argues that a Citizen's 
  Income 'would be particularly well-suited to foster economic initiatives, meaningful 
  work and a rich associational life' (p.169), making formal reciprocity requirements 
  unnecessary; and he finds that 'basic income proposals that seek to build on 
  and develop the social insurance and in-kind benefits of existing welfare state 
  institutions are far better suited to serve objectives [of political legitimacy, 
  sustainability, and gender equity] than radical replacement strategies' (p.204).<br>
  The book is full of enlightening argument, and particularly compelling is a 
  method which sets out from a situation in which a Basic Income has been implemented 
  and then studies a situation in which it has been abolished. This method is 
  well employed on p.59 to demolish the ethical argument for 'welfare to work' 
  policies. <br>
  </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">The 
  book is also full of quite dense argument which assumes some acquaintance with 
  the terminologies and literatures of moral philosophy and political economy: 
  but readers without such an acquaintance will still find the book invigorating 
  because the argument is both thorough and coherent, and because it contains 
  a persuasive riposte to arguments for a welfare state based on enforced reciprocity. 
  (It is no surprise that Stuart White has the longest author entry in the index 
  after John Rawls and Philippe Van Parijs.) In social policy terms, the book 
  is a persuasive argument for a Citizen's Income and against both today's 'welfare 
  to work' benefits structure and a Participation Income. <br>
  Anyone coming to this book will need to work hard at it, but the work will be 
  worth it.<br>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">The 
  thesis of this book is that there is a 'good life' which can be defined independently 
  of our subjective desires, and that it is possible to determine the elements 
  of that good life and some of the means for attaining it. <br>
  </font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">The 
  first chapter sets out from Keynes' prediction that increasing automation would 
  enable us to experience a good life at the same time as working shorter hours: 
  but Keynes 'did not understand that capitalism would set up a new dynamic of 
  want creation which would overwhelm traditional restraints of custom and good 
  sense' (p.42) - and, as the Skidelskys correctly note in chapter 2, capitalism 
  'has given us wealth beyond measure, but has taken away the chief benefit of 
  wealth: the consciousness of having enough' (p.69).<br>
  </font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">Chapter 
  3 surveys pre-modern economic thought, and particularly Aristotle's, for whom 
  money is the servant of the good life rather than being an end in itself. The 
  Skidelskys then divert us down two cul-de-sacs in order to back us out again. 
  They explore the modern 'happiness economics', find it methodologically and 
  ethically suspect, and decide that the pursuit of happiness is no more likely 
  to lead to the good life than is the pursuit of money:<br>
  </font></font></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">Our 
    proper goal, as individuals and as citizens, is not just to be happy but to 
    have reason to be happy. To have the good things of life - health, respect, 
    friendship, leisure - is to have reason to be happy. (p.123)<br>
    Similarly, the authors urge us not to argue from the dangers of climate change 
    to a necessity to reduce economic growth. They prefer a 'good life environmentalism': 
    the pursuit of an objectively good life which requires us to treat nature 
    kindly because 'harmony with nature is part of the good life' (p.140).</font></font></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">Chapter 
  6 is the heart of the book because it describes the good life in terms of a 
  set of 'basic goods', defined as goods which are 'universal, meaning that they 
  belong to the good life as such ... final, meaning that they are good in themselves, 
  and not just as a means to some other good ... sui generis, meaning that they 
  are not part of some other good ... indispensable, meaning that anyone who lacks 
  them may be deemed to have suffered a serious loss or harm' (pp.150-52). On 
  the basis of this definition the authors list seven basic goods: health, security, 
  respect, personality ('the ability to frame and execute a plan of life reflective 
  of one's tastes, temperament and conception of the good' (p.160)), harmony with 
  nature, friendship, and leisure.<br>
  </font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">The 
  authors study indicators related to the elements of the good life and find that 
  in many ways life in the UK is less good than it was forty years ago. They recommend 
  a 'non-coercive paternalism' (p.193), and at the heart of their prescription 
  is an argument for a Citizen's Income on the basis of their definition of the 
  good life. For instance: leisure and self-directed activity are necessary constituents 
  of the good life, so to enable more people to be employed part-time, which a 
  Citizen's Income would do, would enable more people to experience the good life. 
  <br>
  </font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">It 
  is unfortunate that the book advocates the pursuit of the good life purely in 
  terms of our generation of homo sapiens, and explicitly does so in the chapter 
  on 'limits to growth'. A good life for the planet, and a good life for future 
  generations, are surely just as important as the good life for us. The reader 
  will need to decide whether the Skidelskys have made an adequate case for downplaying 
  that importance. It is also a pity that the book contains no separate bibliography.<br>
  </font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="2">But 
  having said that, it is a pleasure to see a book which in general so cogently 
  combines a clearly formulated principle, diagnosis of our current plight, a 
  clear route towards a desired end, and detailed policy prescription designed 
  to take us along that route.<br>
  We are of course most encouraged that the Skidelskys have concluded that the 
  attainment of the good life requires a Citizen's Income. <br>
