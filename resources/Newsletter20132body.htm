<p><font size="3"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 2013 
  budget</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his budget George 
  Osborne announced that the individual tax allowance will rise to &pound;10,000 
  in 2014. This means that &pound;10,000 of an individual's earned income will 
  be tax free. The basic rate of income tax is 20%, so if instead of receiving 
  a tax allowance of &pound;10,000 each individual was given a Citizen's Income 
  of &pound;2,000 per annum (i.e., about &pound;40 per week) and they paid tax 
  on all of their earned income, then their net income - the money they had to 
  spend - would be exactly the same. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The higher the 
  tax allowance, the higher the Citizen's Income that could replace it. We look 
  forward to the tax allowance going even higher.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The important difference 
  between a tax allowance and a Citizen's Income, of course, is that everyone 
  would get the Citizen's Income but not everyone gets a tax allowance. If you're 
  earning, then you receive the benefit of a tax allowance, and it's not taken 
  away from you, however much you earn. But if you're on means-tested benefits 
  (which includes so-called Tax Credits, of course) then as your earnings rise 
  your benefits are taken away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There are few social 
  policies that could do as much both for work incentives and for a cohesive society 
  as a Citizen's Income would do.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Plan B+1</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to 
  the Government's policies for reducing the debt generated by the previous Government's 
  bail-out of the banks, in 2011 the thinktank <i>Compass</i> published <i><a href="http://www.compassonline.org.uk/publications/item.asp?d=6284">Plan 
  B: a good economy for a good society</a></i>. It was full of good ideas: investment 
  in renewable energy and in energy conservation; government support for new technology; 
  the separation of retail and investment banking; a financial transaction tax; 
  and a social investment strategy. The report also contained a suggestion that 
  means-tested benefit rates should be raised so that people on lower incomes 
  could receive higher incomes which they could then spend in order to stimulate 
  the economy (<i>Plan B</i>, p.20). The report showed no understanding of the 
  fact that to increase the levels of means-tested benefits would carry the disincentive 
  effects associated with the withdrawal of means-tested benefits higher up the 
  earnings range, thus extending higher labour market disincentives to additional 
  sections of the workforce. As we pointed out in our editorial in the <i>Citizen's 
  Income Newsletter</i> (issue 2 for 2012), there was nothing 'plan B' about means-tested 
  benefits, that Compass needed to think again, and that it needed to see that 
  universal benefits combined with a progressive tax system would successfully 
  target money on the poor at the same time as increasing incentives and choice 
  in the labour market. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Compass</i> 
  has now thought again. Its new report, <i><a href="http://www.compassonline.org.uk/news/item.asp?n=16700">Plan 
  B+1: Rebuilding Britain and a Good Society</a></i>, is in many ways a second 
  instalment of its previous report. It outlines the economic and human costs 
  of austerity; shows why current government policies (in this case quantitative 
  easing, the Business Investment Bank, and deregulation) are unlikely to work; 
  and suggests Green capital investment, a social investment state, a living wage, 
  industrial democracy, and reform of the financial sector. But in one respect 
  <i>Compass</i> has performed a U-turn. Gone is the plan for higher means-tested 
  benefits, and in its place we find a proposal for 'a universal family basic 
  income' and a 'comprehensive direct tax which would replace the current income 
  tax and National Insurance Contributions systems' (<i>Plan B+1</i>, p.16). It 
  is worth repeating in full the report's arguments for this proposal:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The system of 
    tax and transfer payments needs to be reconfigured to ensure that:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. All families 
    reach a basic minimum standard of living in or out of work.<br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. The tax system 
    is progressive, with people on high incomes paying a higher proportion of 
    their incomes in direct tax than at present;<br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Marginal withdrawal 
    rates on earned income for people on low wages (including second earners in 
    couples) are low enough to make work worthwhile. (p.16)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The plan for a 
  universal family basic income and an appropriate comprehensive direct tax would 
  achieve these aims, and therefore has something to recommend it. The universal, 
  and presumably nonwithdrawable, basic income would take marginal withdrawal 
  rates as low as it is possible to take them. It would also therefore make employment 
  as financially beneficial as it is possible for the benefits system to make 
  it, and at the same time would provide an automatic standard of living in or 
  out of work.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The one criticism 
  of the plan that we would offer relates to the word 'family'. If this means 
  that two adults living together will be granted a lower joint basic income than 
  twice the rate for an individual living on his or her own, then <i>Plan B+1</i> 
  will deliver colossal administrative problems and might end up being highly 
  unpopular, and for good reasons. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Current means-tested 
  benefits, both in and out of work, pay less to a couple than twice the rate 
  for an individual. This means that the Department for Work and Pensions and 
  Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs need to know who is living with whom, resulting 
  in intrusive bureaucratic investigations into people's private lives and the 
  stigma inevitably attached to such intrusion; that when relationships change 
  government departments need to be informed; and that when someone moves in with 
  someone else their benefits might be withdrawn. At the moment these problematic 
  aspects of our benefits system apply only to those on no pay or low pay. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In his 2010 Conservative 
  Party Conference speech, the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed that households 
  containing higher rate taxpayers should be deprived of their Child Benefit. 
  This too would have required him to know who was living with whom: and for the 
  first time the higher paid would have been brought into this bureaucratic and 
  stigmatising net. He performed a sensible U-turn, and Child Benefit remains 
  universal; but because he still wished to extract all or some of the value of 
  their Child Benefit from households containing higher-rate taxpayers, self-declaration 
  by a higher-rate taxpayer of being in a household containing someone in receipt 
  of Child Benefit has left us with the first ever tax on children. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We would counsel 
  against a 'family basic income'. It would suffer from the same problems suffered 
  by every benefit based on households rather than on individuals: it would interfere 
  with decisions about relationships, would complicate household formation, and 
  would require the Government to investigate people's intimate relationships; 
  and it would require a major and expensive government agency to administer it 
  (which presumably means that we might see departmental approval for the idea). 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A Citizen's Income 
  - an unconditional, nonwithdrawable income paid to each<i> individual</i> - 
  would avoid all of these problems. It would be simple and cheap to administer, 
  it would not interfere with personal relationships or household formation, and 
  it would make it entirely unnecessary for the Government to know who was living 
  with whom. A particular advantage of a Citizen's Income paid to individuals 
  is that any economies of scale relating to people moving in with each other 
  would accrue to the people concerned, thus making household formation more likely. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It may be that 
  the authors of <i>Plan B+1</i> are concerned about the affordability of a genuine 
  Citizen's Income. This is an understandable concern. However, if, as they suggest, 
  a radical overhaul of the entire benefits and tax systems is what is required, 
  then there will be numerous gainers and losers as changes occur - as there have 
  been in relation to recent changes to the benefits and tax systems, and as there 
  will be when Universal Credit is implemented. Transitional arrangements will 
  in any case be required, and transferring from a household-based to an individual-based 
  system will not overly complicate the temporary arrangements required. The additional 
  factor related to any change that delivers lower employment disincentives is 
  that any net income gap resulting from a drop in benefit levels is more easily 
  repaired through additional earnings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is essential 
  is to get the structure right. A Citizen's Income would deliver all three of 
  the criteria for an appropriate tax and benefits system listed above, and without 
  imposing new stigmatizing complexities. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We look forward 
  to a <i>Plan B+1a</i> and to a recommendation of a genuine Citizen's Income.<br>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font size="3">Can 
  Basic Income Cash Transfers Transform India?</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>by Guy Standing</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the 1990s, 
  on average the Indian economy has been growing at over 6% a year. Yet hundreds 
  of millions remain mired in poverty, and inequality has grown steadily. For 
  decades, although there are 1,200 centrally-funded social policies on the statute 
  books and hundreds more at state level, successive governments have relied largely 
  on the Public Distribution System (PDS) to redress poverty. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The PDS subsidises 
  consumers via subsidised grain, rice, sugar and kerosene if they have a Below 
  Poverty Line (BPL) card or something similar. Producers of many goods receive 
  huge subsidies as well. Altogether, subsidies eat up 7% of GDP.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They do not work. 
  The system is wasteful, inefficient, market-distorting, regressive and deeply 
  corrupt. Rajiv Gandhi famously said that 85% of subsidised food did not reach 
  the poor. The Deputy Chair of the Planning Commission said in 2009 that only 
  16% of it reached them. Others have estimated that for every Rupee spent 72% 
  is lost in transit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While continuing 
  with the PDS, in 2005 the Congress Party, long regarded as the bastion of Indian 
  democracy, launched a grandiose National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), 
  supposedly guaranteeing every rural household 100 days of labour a year at the 
  minimum wage. Huge numbers have supposedly benefited, vast sums spent, many 
  eulogies uttered. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In reality, ghosts 
  have been resurrected, recorded as having done labour. Most rural people have 
  had few if any days of labour under the scheme (renamed to give it the status 
  of having Gandhi's name preface it). Much of the money has gone into local bureaucrats' 
  pockets. One study estimated that only 8% of recipients had been employed for 
  100 days in one year. Another suggested that only a minority of projects had 
  been completed, another that it has not reduced rural poverty at all. Corruption 
  is endemic. The scheme only awaits a journalist to write a book entitled <i>The 
  Greatest Social Policy Scam in History</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, something 
  remarkable has been brewing. A radical alternative has been gaining ground. 
  In 2009, led by SEWA (the Self-Employed Women's Association), we launched the 
  first of three pilot cash transfer schemes. The principle is simple: Give people 
  cash, a basic income, instead of subsidies or make-work labour. And do not attach 
  conditions, directing people how to spend the money; they can work that out 
  for themselves. We do not claim credit for what has happened since, for other 
  factors have contributed. But the pilots have proved timely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first, financed 
  by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), took place in a low-income 
  area of Delhi, where hundreds of households were offered the alternative of 
  continuing with the subsidised items or receive a monthly cash transfer of equivalent 
  value. Many initially chose the cash. Later, when we did the evaluation, many 
  more wished to do so. Although a political campaign was organised in opposition 
  to the cash transfers, involving physical violence towards our women fieldworkers, 
  the results have been very positive, with improvements to living standards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Meanwhile, with 
  financial help from UNICEF, we launched a bigger pilot in the state of Madhya 
  Pradesh. In eight villages, for eighteen months, every man, woman and child 
  has received an unconditional monthly cash transfer. Over 5,500 villagers have 
  been recipients. We have been evaluating the effects by comparison with people 
  living in comparable villages, in a randomised control trial. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Such pilots take 
  a long time. Politics does not wait. Suffice it to note that the results of 
  this and the third pilot in tribal villages are heart-warming. Even though the 
  amount paid is very modest, about 30% of bare subsistence, we have observed 
  improvements in nutrition, school attendance and performance, women's status, 
  economic activity, and sanitation. Many villagers have told us they want to 
  substitute cash for subsidies. More have come round to that as experience has 
  been gained. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What seems to happen 
  is that the cash provides liquidity and a sense of security that infuses confidence 
  and gives people a greater sense of control over their lives. So the positive 
  effects exceed the value of the transfer. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is what has 
  happened back in Delhi that is so intriguing. In the past few months, we have 
  been asked to brief senior officials, and they have been emboldened to push 
  cash transfers into the centre of national debate. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In November, the 
  Prime Minister went on television to announce that the government is to launch 
  a cash transfer scheme, rolling it out to 51 districts in 2013 by raising the 
  price of kerosene and compensating people by cash paid into bank accounts. Not 
  to be outdone, on the 15th December, Delhi's Chief Minister launched an unconditional 
  cash transfer scheme in her state for those omitted from the cap put on BPL 
  card holders. A torrent of media comment has followed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Congress Party 
  has been converted. Earlier this month, its leader, Sonia Gandhi, the Prime 
  Minister, and several Cabinet colleagues, descended by helicopter on a village 
  and announced its cash transfer policy to a crowd of 30,000. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Indian social policy 
  is at a crossroads. Opposing cash transfers, a group of diehard supporters of 
  the PDS have been promoting a Right to Food bill that would universalise the 
  PDS and subsidised food. They have also organised hostile protests. They claim 
  cash benefits would lead to abandonment of public social services. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They are being 
  Canutish. The PDS is literally rotten, as Delhi's Chief Minister has admitted. 
  Often grain comes in sacks that contain numerous small stones to make up the 
  weight; often the grain and rice are stale; often villagers travel long distances 
  only to find that the rations are not there. All this is ignored. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The risk now is 
  that, in the rush to operationalize cash transfers across the country, design 
  faults and excessive politicisation will put back the cause for years. Here 
  we have a lesson for government. In the villages receiving the basic income, 
  the payments have been an extra, not a substitute for something. We asked everybody 
  to open a bank account within three months of receiving their first payment. 
  There were predictable teething problems. But soon, everybody had accounts, 
  with help from our colleagues. In that time, suspicions were allayed and support 
  for cash transfers strengthened.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The government 
  is doing it the wrong way. It is raising the price of a subsidised item, kerosene, 
  telling people they will be compensated through a bank and by means of an identity 
  card, the Aardaar. But, as the government's pilot has shown, many will lose 
  in the short-term since they do not have accounts and cannot obtain the cash. 
  This risks a backlash.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The solution must 
  be based on realising that, while villagers are always on the edge financially, 
  a government can take a medium-term perspective. If it rolled out the scheme 
  to those 51 districts by offering extra money in the first year while stating 
  that everybody must open a bank account in that time, the fiscal cost will be 
  small. In the second year, it could phase out selected subsidies, sharing the 
  gains by disbursing a third of the subsidy in additional payments while saving 
  the fiscal coffers the other two-thirds. Remember that most money spent on subsidies 
  does not reach the intended beneficiaries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Will wisdom prevail? 
  One cannot be optimistic. It is a pre-election year and Congress is set on making 
  cash transfers what a leading politician has called &quot;a game-changer&quot;, 
  an election-winning measure. This will galvanise opposition. Everybody would 
  gain if only the politicians had the wisdom to de-politicise the reform. The 
  Government should set up an independent Cash Transfers Commission to oversee 
  the process and to ensure that the level of benefits is set by economic criteria 
  and not raised just before elections.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How much better 
  it would be if unconditional, universal, individual cash benefits were rolled 
  out slowly and quietly. We know they have made a great difference to the lives 
  of those thousands of villagers in our pilots. We have heard their stories, 
  seen their children and analysed the data gathered by our fieldworkers. There 
  is a great chance of transforming Indian social policy. Let us hope the politicians 
  take it.</font></p>

  of financial responsibility from the state to individuals, and asks for the 
  policies necessary to achieve this (such as the new policy of auto-enrolment 
  in occupational pension schemes). 'Nothing sums up the UK's paradoxical and 
  incoherent approach to individual financial responsibility better than the way 
  in which our public services interact with individuals' savings. In a range 
  of areas, savers - those who have taken long-term, financially responsible decisions 
  and have chosen to mitigate their financial risk by building a cash asset - 
  are actively punished for their prudence. This is most obvious - and most problematic

  targeted systems should be replaced by services that are open to all in a way 
  that is universally preventative; this means providing services for everyone

  welfare state; it reduces stigma, ensures proper take-up, is more efficient 
  to deliver, promotes gender equality, binds all into a progressive taxation 
  system and ensures the sharp tongues and elbows of the middle classes improve 
  services in a way that benefits everyone. It is no wonder that by all measures 
  of economic and social success, international league tables are topped by societies 
  with strong universal welfare states. It is important to note that the so-called 
  &quot;universal&quot; credit which aims to combine both in-work and out-of-work 
  benefits for those on low incomes within a single unified model is not universal 
  at all but cements means-testing into the foundations of the social security 
  system (while contributory benefits are being further marginalised at the same 
  time). It also contains more conditionality than the existing system' (p.6).<a href="http://clients.squareeye.net/uploads/compass/documents/C4_Compass_Document.pdf">

  debates over the introduction of a Basic Income.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A big challenge 
  for a survey of the Citizens' Income debate is to balance breadth with depth. 
  How does one best combine the detail and insight that different authors offer 
  with the need to offer comparative analysis and discussion of themes across

  journey, helping the reader to pick up specific nuances of debates in individual

  to international themes. Key topics covered in all of these essays are the historical 
  drivers and opportunities that push forward discussion of Citizen's Income, 
  the political enablers and barriers to progress in these debates, and the prospect 
  for progress in the future. </font></p>

  framework for considering political feasibility of the Basic Income project. 
  De Wispelaere and Nogerua consider feasibility in strategic, institutional and 
  psychological dimensions by mapping two different types of agency against two 
  types of constraints. It feels a bit of a missed opportunity that this framework 
  is offered at the start of the book but not addressed directly by other contributors. 
  However, even without explicitly addressing this framework the reader will find 
  the key barriers and key enablers identified by De Wispelare and Noguera cropping 
  up in the individual chapters. Most notably, the challenges of institutional 
  inflexibility, and the need to convert key political actors and to build coalitions 
  across parties and interests in order to create strategic feasibility for a 
  Citizens Income. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The region and 
  country specific analyses begin on a confident note. In Chapter 3 Suplicy makes 
  a powerful economic and political case for a Basic Income for underdeveloped 
  economies aiming to jumpstart their global competitiveness. In the subsequent 
  chapter, Guy Standing reflects on the first twenty-five years of BIEN and considers 
  that richer nations may turn again to the issue of universal benefits in response 
  to continued economic strife, the depletion of social protection, and the rise 
  of social unrest. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The rest of the 
  book is made up of 11 chapters that draw on social policy and political debates 
  to examine the prospects for Citizen's Income in a number of different contexts. 
  This reviewer found the most satisfying chapters those that took a thematic 
  approach, which allowed a lay reader to make their own comparisons between the 
  experiences of different countries. Sacha Liebermann's chapter on the German 
  experience does this masterfully. It is introduced with a quick summary of the 
  current debate and then thematic headings covering the major barriers addressed 
  by discussions over Citizen's Income in the last thirty or so years. In Germany's 
  case, this includes: the challenge of unconditionality (or 'to live at the cost 
  of others without any contribution') and debates over the link with citizenship 
  and over how to resolve the position of families and childcare within the overall 
  welfare system. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is a lot 
  of richness in this volume. The authors have reflected widely and fully on social 
  and political discourses, taking in formal actors and policy makers as well 
  as think tanks and more grass roots movements. One of the difficulties and the 
  rewards of a volume like this is the sheer diversity of experiences. Markku 
  Ikkala looks back over twenty years of debates in Finland, identifying and analysing 
  strands of support from the Green Party and some sections of the Press. Malcolm 
  Torry's analysis of the backdrop to current debates about universality in the 
  United Kingdom examines themes from the process that led to the Family Allowance 
  Act of 1945 and from the Child Benefit debates of the late 1960s. Alongside 
  these we have in depth analyses that focus on the immediate context of contemporary 
  welfare debates. For instance, the chapter on Spain focuses on the deficit reduction 
  package from 2010 onwards and Hamid Tabatabai's account asks what we can learn 
  from Iran's 2010 cash subsidy programme. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One important theme 
  across the regions analysed is the important role of economic instability as 
  a precursor to the revival or creation of new debates on universal benefits 
  as the fragile consensus on welfare systems and social entitlements comes under 
  ever more pressure. In the analysis of the Spanish experience, by Daniel Raventos, 
  Julie Wark and David Casassas, the authors distil the frustration experienced 
  by supporter of a Citizen's Income in the wake of the economic crisis. For families 
  and workers, a Basic Income could provide much needed security, a serious anti-poverty 
  policy, and a sustainable way of maintaining family income following the debt-based 
  consumption of the early years of the twenty-first century. And yet precisely 
  when the supporters feel the case is most pressing politicians are under pressure 
  to reduce expenditure and target welfare spending on narrow sections of the 
  population. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While it seems 
  churlish to criticise a volume of essays for BIEN members and supporters for 
  not including contributions of opponents of the Citizen's Income, one limitation 
  of the chapters is a lack of context for some of the more aspirational comments 
  on the future of pressure from think tanks, student groups and activists. While 
  many authors are able to cite specific publications, events and movements as 
  evidence, several chapters include a general positive endorsement or aspiration 
  which feels less contextualised. This includes the aside at the end of the essay 
  on Spain's experience. The authors argue that 'it can only be expected' that 
  the interest in a Citizen's Income will keep growing from activists as the economic 
  crisis persists and unemployment grows, but don't offer more solid grounds for 
  hope than that statement. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Looking across 
  the chapters, one key question this reviewer was left with was how supporters 
  of a Citizen's Income should view these national and international debates as 
  an indicator of progress and possible next steps. De Wispelaere and Noguera 
  discuss how we might frame public perception of a Citizen's Income in the context 
  of arguments about reciprocity and deservingness of benefit recipients. This 
  is salutary for those who already support Basic Income. A number of different 
  chapters point to elements of universality as indicators of the progress of 
  the argument for a Citizen's Income or as building blocks on which to develop 
  a stronger case for universality. Changes in pensions in Australia and to tax 
  credits in the UK and Ireland can be seen either as useful stepping stones on 
  a gradualist and pragmatic journey towards a Citizen's Income, as diversions 
  from making the full case for universality, or as further confusing already 
  complex systems. Alternatively, should a Citizen's Income be considered as a 
  separate discourse of its own? More fundamentally, this reviewer was left asking, 
  what can we learn from these experiences about how to frame a theory of change 
  for the future? And what would ambitious but realistic intermediate goals look 
  like for the next ten years?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is a strength 
  of this book that it provides the depth and breadth of reach not only to prompt 
  this kind of question but also to provide significant evidence for the analysis 
  of these issues. The volume offers a timely stocktake, and an opportunity to 
  reflect on debates in the past, present and future. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is unusual for 
  us to review foreign language books in the <i>Citizen's Income Newsletter</i>, 
  but an exception surely has to be made for this German book which has been a 
  consistent bestseller, significantly in the 'business' category. 1 (Because 
  the book's content is so tightly tied to the German context it is unlikely to 
  be translated into English, which is why we are reviewing the German text rather 
  than waiting for an English translation.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first part 
  of the book discusses the German political context and the Citizen's Income 
  debate within it. This is followed by sections on what the authors take to be 
  essential elements of the definition of a Citizen's Income: large enough to 
  cover subsistence needs; for every individual; without means-test; and without 
  work-test. Objections are then answered, particularly in relation to labour 
  market participation. An interesting section uses the fact that most lottery 
  winners remain in the labour market as important evidence. The concept of 'work' 
  is then broadened beyond the labour market, and a variety of imagined personal 
  situations show how a Citizen's Income would promote diverse kinds of work. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Werner is a successful 
  entrepreneur, so perhaps it is not surprising that rather too much space is 
  then given to how workplaces have changed during the past few decades and how 
  they might be further humanised with the help of a Citizen's Income. Even more 
  space is then given to the German education system and how it might be reformed. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The authors discuss 
  implementation of a Citizen's Income scheme, and suggest that it should be paid 
  first for children and young people and then to older people (largely because 
  women's historically low labour market participation means that they are often 
  ill-prepared financially for old age). An interesting section suggests that 
  the income security we need was once provided by the family but now cannot be, 
  and that only a Citizen's Income will be able to fill the gap. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A chapter on the 
  results of the Namibian Citizen's Income pilot project contains too much about 
  microcredit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1000&euro; per 
  month is a lot of money. The authors intend to pay for a Citizen's Income this 
  large through taxing consumption rather than income and by abolishing most other 
  government expenditure. They write rather too much about consumption taxes and 
  are somewhat unrealistic about the level at which they might be collectable. 
  Whether we would wish to abolish other public expenditure to the same extent 
  in the UK, in which we already have a universal National Health Service and 
  universal free education based on the same principles as a Citizen's Income, 
  is rather doubtful.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But the authors 
  are right to ask for radical change. We are no longer a 'self-help' agrarian 
  society. We now rely heavily on other people's work, and therefore belong to 
  a 'stranger-help' society. This is a huge paradigm shift, and it suggests that 
  a welfare system based on self-help, as social insurance is, really does now 
  need to be replaced by a system based on 'stranger-help', the purest form of 
  which can only be a Citizen's Income. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is a somewhat 
  rambling book. There are long sections on matters with only oblique relationships 
  to the Citizen's Income proposal, and the authors frequently return to issues 
  already discussed. A forceful editor might have prevented the authors from expatiating 
  on their rather irrelevant enthusiasms, and could have helped them to create 
  a more concise, more connected, and better ordered book: but what is really 
  interesting is that this holdall of a book should have become such a best seller. 
  I suspect that this is because within it the magnitude of the changes facing 
  our society are expressed with some feeling, and a proposal radical enough to 
  respond to those changes, and sufficiently feasible for implementation to be 
  conceivable, is expounded with equal feeling. This is above all an enthusiastic 
  book by authors who believe that real change is possible. </font></p>

  Widerquist and Michael Howard, <i>Alaska's Permanent Fund Dividend: Examining 
  its suitability as a model</i></font>, Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, xvii + 267 
  pp, hbk, 0 230 11207 0, &pound;62.50</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 1967 oil was 
  found in the relatively new state of Alaska; in 1976 a constitutional amendment 
  established the Alaska Permanent Fund (APF) to receive 25% of oil royalties; 
  and in 1982 the fund paid out the first Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) to every 
  Alaskan citizen: the same amount to every individual. The world had its first 
  Citizen's Income.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This important 
  edited collection tells the political and legislative story of the APF and PFD, 
  explains their operation, and discusses the dividend's economic impacts ( - 
  from being the US state with the most unequal net incomes in 1980, Alaska is 
  now the state with the least net income inequality: p.53). Chapter 5 shows how 
  distributing a dividend from a permanent fund generates political protection 
  for resource revenues; chapter 6 explores the trade-off between higher average 
  dividends and lower volatility facing any permanent fund administrators; and 
  chapters 7 and 8 ask what will happen when the oil stops flowing: Will the Alaskan 
  economy be in sufficiently good shape for the Permanent Fund to remain a political 
  possibility?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the second part 
  of the book a number of authors debate the ethics of the Alaskan model. They 
  find that Left-Libertarianism requires the collection and distribution of the 
  natural resource components of all privately owned wealth; that the PFD constitutes 
  a kind of Citizen's Income (though the fact that it fluctuates compromises its 
  ability to behave like one); that if the dividend were to be transformed into 
  a capital sum for every citizen at the age of majority, then citizens would 
  become genuine stakeholders in the economy (with the temptations that that would 
  bring); that the dividend only ambiguously coheres with a republican 'freedom-as-nondomination' 
  perspective; that registering for the PFD makes the individual citizen complicit 
  in the oil industry's contribution to climate change (though if Alaskan citizens 
  were at the same time to prevent the same amount of climate change as Alaska's 
  oil industry causes then they would escape this charge); and that a Citizen's 
  Income can be consistent with a variety of moral theories. Finally, Widerquist 
  and Howard draw a number of lessons: that resource dividends work, that they 
  are popular, that they can be established anywhere politicians are willing to 
  look for opportunities (as Governor Jay Hammond did); that governments need 
  to assert community ownership of resources; and that coalitions need to be built 
  if resource dividends are to be established and then defended. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have waited 
  a long time for a thorough book-length treatment of the APF and PFD, and Widerquist 
  and Howard have served us well by pulling together such a relevant and coherent 
  collection of essays. The one weakness is not of their making: As Scott Goldsmith 
  suggests in chapter 4, there has been too little research on the economic and 
  social impacts of the APF and the PFD. The research needs to be done and a second 
  edition of the book then published so that we can all benefit from the results.</font></p>

  167 pp, &pound;9.99</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For each of the 
  fifty models there is a page or two of text and a page or two of diagrams. To 
  give a flavour: There is a page about the 'm=3 and n=1' model: that is, we experience 
  three dimensions of space and one of time. The text points out that the mathematics 
  of quantum field theory can be formulated in rather more dimensions than that, 
  but that more than three dimensions of space would offer too little stability, 
  fewer than three insufficient complexity (and so no gravitation), and only a 
  single time dimension permits causality inferences. (Readers beware: the authors 
  have muddled up their ms and their ns.) The final paragraph theorises about 
  a multiuniverse in which universes with different numbers of time and space 
  dimensions are uninhabitable. The following page explains the situation with 
  a diagram: and that's wrong, too, because the text does foresee a universe with 
  three spatial dimensions and more than one time dimension. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To take another, 
  more successfully executed, example: a page of text explains why economic booms 
  and busts occur (rising share prices attract investors, falling share prices 
  prompt selling); and a diagram usefully portrays how expected share price varies 
  more than earnings per share (which more nearly reflects economic reality). 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The models are 
  divided into 'Explaining our world' (the section containing the examples above), 
  'Explaining my world', 'changing my world', and 'changing our world'. The divisions 
  are somewhat arbitrary. Take the example in which we might be most interested 
  in this <i>Newsletter</i>: the Basic Income Model is located in the 'changing 
  my world' section, but could equally well have been included under 'changing 
  our world'. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The two pages of 
  text on a Citizen's Income (pp. 84-5) begin with a paragraph on problems facing 
  our society ('the death of the social'), and then describe a Basic Income as 
  a 'polemical as well as fascinating concept based on the idea that those who 
  want to work should not be hindered and those who do not want to work should 
  not be forced to do so'. The advantages of a Citizen's Income are well described 
  ('There would be no more unemployment nor the social stigma attached to it', 
  'The job market would be &quot;freer&quot;, etc.), and possible disadvantages 
  are faced: for instance, 'a restrictive immigration policy'. The authors finally 
  offer some questions: 'Would people become lazy ...?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The authors are 
  clearly rather taken with the idea of a Citizen's or Basic Income, and their 
  enthusiasm is welcome, but the fact that the book is all about 'change', and 
  preferably change as radical as possible, a Citizen's Income is described throughout 
  as a world-changing policy. Rather than calling the pages 'Basic Income', they 
  use the title 'What would turn our society upside down' (without a question 
  mark); and in the text the idea is called 'polemical as well as fascinating'. 
  This might not be helpful. Another way of describing a Citizen's Income is as 
  a minor administrative change that would deliver appreciable economic and social 
  benefits, and it is by framing the proposal in that way that we might be more 
  likely to see movement towards establishing a Citizen's Income. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The following two 
  pages offer a very useful, and rather less polemical, diagram, showing the connections 
  between the current benefits system and a system based on a Basic Income (wage 
  labour, money, and social status) and the differences: minimal bureaucracy in 
  place of lots, freedom in place of stigmatisation, a focus on potential rather 
  than a focus on need, and good wages for bad jobs rather than bad wages for 
  bad jobs. The only problem with the 'Basic Income' side of the diagram is that's 
  entitled 'utopia'. It wouldn't be. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the edition 
  of <i>The Big Issue</i> for the 14th to the 20th January Mikael Krogerus has 
  written a two page article about <i>The Change Book</i>. The three models featured 
  are about the pain that results from change, about how world governance might 
  evolve, and about 'What would turn our society upside down?' (this time with 
  a question mark) - and here he repeats the full text and diagram from the four 
  pages in the book about Basic Income. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The authors' purpose 
  isn't entirely described by the title or subtitle. They claim in their introduction 
  that the book 'is about children's visibility, voice and vision' (p.1): that 
  is, about children as agents. Even that isn't accurate, because we don't in 
  fact hear children's own voices and visions in the book. What we hear is adults 
  formulating ways in which we might experience children's visibility, voice and 
  vision. The questions that the authors ask are these: 'How can we understand 
  child poverty and well-being? What types of knowledge are being generated about 
  the nature, extent and trends in child poverty and well-being in developing-country 
  contexts? How can this evidence catalyse change to support children's visibility, 
  voice and vision? Finally, how do these questions play out in different contexts?' 
  (p.1).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first part 
  of the book studies concepts of child poverty and well-being, how knowledge 
  about these is generated, how policy is formulated, and how knowledge informs 
  policy. Well-being is understood in relation to a child's relationships and 
  subjectivity as well as in material terms; there is a detailed discussion of 
  the diversity of evidence available; and policy-formation is understood as a 
  complex process from which children's voices are frequently excluded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The second part 
  of the book contains chapters on Africa, on Asia, and on Latin America and the 
  Caribbean. For each continent there are sections on material, relational and 
  subjective well-being; a section on knowledge generation (mainly in relation 
  to information-gathering institutions); a study of the interaction between knowledge 
  gathered and policy formation; and a case study. A concluding chapter emphases 
  the importance of a child-centred approach if child poverty is to be abolished. 
  Throughout the book there are tabulated literature reviews which will be immensely 
  useful to future researchers. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It <i>would </i>have 
  been interesting to have heard the voices of children, particularly in relation 
  to the case studies. It would also have been educational to include a chapter 
  on child poverty in so-called developed countries, and on how visible and audible 
  children are in those countries' policy processes. Perhaps these areas could 
  be tackled in future publications. It would also be educational to see research 
  findings on how effective particular policy initiatives have been in tackling 
  child poverty as defined in part I of the book, and on how children experience 
  those initiatives - in their own words.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In particular: 
  Does the gradual shift away from service provision and towards conditional cash 
  payments (such as Brazil's <i>bolsa familia</i>) improve children's material, 
  relational and subjective well-being? And would a Citizen's Income improve children's 
  well-being further? (See our report on a Namibian Citizen's Income pilot project 
  in the <i>Citizen's Income Newsletter</i>, issue 2 for 2009). In evaluating 
  the outcomes, children's voices will be crucial, as this book rightly suggests.</font></p>

  It isn't. But it is an exercise parallel in many respects to the research that 
  the Citizen's Income Trust and others have done on feasible extensions of universal 
  benefits. The book recognises that the current monetary system has to continue 
  much as it is; it identifies problems with the current system, and argues convincingly 
  that plural currencies at a variety of levels (local, national, and European) 
  would be a partial solution to many of the current difficulties and would reduce 
  the risk of future crises; it studies and evaluates existing experiments in 
  alternative currencies; and it makes feasible proposals on the basis of those 
  evaluations. Similarly, we have shown that a Citizen's Income would be an adaptation 
  of the existing tax and benefits system, that it would respond to a variety

  of universal benefits, and that it would be feasible. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This collection 
  of essays tackles a major issue: the declining living standards of households 
  on low to middle incomes (defined as households in income deciles 2 to 5). Both 
  causes and partial solutions are explored. One major cause of declining living 
  standards is the failure to maintain the value of national minimum wages, but 
  another is the gravitation of the proceeds of economic growth towards households 
  in the upper earning deciles, leaving lower earners struggling to afford mortgages, 
  social care, and, in the US, health care. Partial solutions might be focused 
  training, in-work benefits, more affordable housing, higher national minimum 
  wages, employers paying a 'living wage', and jobs of better quality ( - the 
  UK has a better record than the US here, particularly in relation to employment 
  rights for agency and part-time workers). The authors suggest that attending 
  to the politics of the situation is essential, and that an important direction 
  of travel might be asset-based welfare provision such as child trust funds, 
  although some of the current attempts at incentivising asset accumulation tend 
  to privilege the already wealthy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The volume's concluding 
  chapter finds the US experience to be worse than the UK's, and warns the UK 
  to avoid policies that have led the US towards ever greater inequality. A particular 
  lesson to take to heart is that the welfare state, and particularly free health 
  care, has protected lower and middle earners in the UK from some of the worst 
  effects of the economic downturn suffered in the United States: so if the UK 
  wishes to avoid the plummeting living standards of the US then maintaining a 
  strong welfare state is essential.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, as Lane 
  Kenworthy explains, some elements of the welfare state might be more of a problem 
  than a solution. Tax Credits (and Universal Credit) weaken employment incentives, 
  particularly for second earners, 'and may in fact make things worse for many 
  families' (p.40). Daniel Gitterman contributes a detailed study of the United 
  States' Earned Income Tax Credit, in the course of which he makes a few comparisons 
  with the UK's Tax Credits. He might have added that the US Tax Credits are close 
  to being genuine (annual) tax credits, whereas the UK's 'Tax Credits' are in 
  fact means-tested benefits, with all the problems usually consequent upon means-testing. 
  In their introduction, the editors write that households with net incomes in 
  the second, third, fourth and fifth income deciles are 'not heavily reliant 
  on means-tested benefits' (p.xi). This might be true in the US, but it is not 
  true in the UK, where a high proportion of earners in the second and third income 
  deciles will be heavily reliant on means-tested 'Tax Credits'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The book covers 
  a lot of ground, in terms of both diagnosis and prescription. However, diagnosis 
  of the employment disincentives imposed by means-tested Tax Credits is not followed 
  up with any prescription for reform. A benefits system based more on universal 
  benefits would not impose anything like the same level of employment disincentives 
  as the UK's current system. Child Benefit gets a mention (on p.95: a reference 
  unfortunately not indexed), but only as part of an argument that higher out-of-work 
  benefits reduce employment incentives: a highly misleading suggestion, because 
  Child Benefit is paid at the same rate to households both in and out of employment, 
  and so in no way contributes to employment disincentives. It is the deduction 
  rates related to means-tested benefits that cause such disincentives, not unconditional 
  benefits such as Child Benefit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The declining living 
  standards faced by households with below median incomes are not likely to see 
  much improvement in the near future, and the volume under review will be a valuable 
  tool as policy-makers consider the reforms that might improve living standards 
  for households in income deciles two to five. Policy makers might also wish 
  to consider the possibility that this section of the population would benefit 
  substantially from the implementation of a Citizen's Income.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Nordic countries 
  provide generous gender-neutral parental leave and benefits and also publicly-funded 
  childcare, and the result is an unusual combination of high fertility and high 
  female labour market participation. This book is a detailed study of family

  both mothers as carers in the home and as workers in the labour market, and 
  that men and women are regarded as both different and equal. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The book is a study 
  of how Swedish social policy relating to the family has arrived at its present 
  state and of more recent developments which have been driven in different directions 
  by a greater individualisation in society (and thus defamiliarisation) and an 
  understanding of women as disadvantaged within the family. Most recently, a 
  reintroduction of a benefit for carers at home, and the introduction of labour 
  market incentives for women, have exacerbated the paradoxicality of the situation. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As the concluding 
  section of the book suggests, the fundamental paradox is between equality and 
  freedom of choice. We might put it like this: How to preserve radical gender 
  freedom in the face of government policies aimed at equality in the labour market? 
  And how to preserve gender equality in the face of government legislation designed 
  to give to carers freedom over how they organise their households and their 
  labour market participation? These are vital questions for any government, and 
  are thus an essential field of debate for anyone promoting debate on social 
  policy reform. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fundamental to 
  the argument of this book are two different varieties of subsidiarity: what 
  the authors call 'vertical subsidiarity': the idea that authority should be 
  exercised at the lowest possible level in a hierarchy of authorities; and 'horizontal 
  subsidiarity': the requirement that higher authorities should resource lower-level 
  authorities to pursue the activity over which they have authority, including 
  the resourcing of individuals and households to pursue their own chosen goals. 
  'Network accountability and resourcing', whilst being more of a mouthful, might 
  be a more accurate expression of what the authors intend by 'horizontal subsidiarity': 
  a multi-directional distribution of competences and resources across individuals, 
  households, local communities, private sector companies, voluntary organisations, 
  and public authorities. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The book's first 
  section is more theoretical in nature, and studies concepts relating to governance 
  and subsidiarity; the second section charts the increasing relevance of regions 
  within countries as opposed to nation states; and the third section studies 
  recent changes in welfare state governance - and here UK readers will be particularly 
  interested in Helen Haugh's study of social enterprise involvement in health 
  service delivery, and Martin Powell's comparison of sometimes quite radical 
  vertical and horizontal subsidiarity in Lombardy and the increasing involvement 
  of private sector and voluntary sector organisations in welfare provision in 
  the UK.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The fourth section 
  of the book studies ways in which national governments have resourced households 
  and individuals to take responsibility for their own welfare. Of particular 
  interest will be Julian Le Grand's chapter, in which he discusses the design 
  of quasi-markets in welfare delivery, how to ensure equity of provision in a 
  quasi-market context, and why such asset-based welfare instruments as child 
  trust funds should be universal. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tax and benefits 
  were not on the agenda of the group of scholars convened by the Institute for 
  Research, Statistics and Training in Lombardy to research and write this volume. 
  If a further volume tackles this subject then a chapter might usefully be given 
  to an impending experiment in the UK. Since the nineteenth century, social security 
  benefits have been a nation state competence ( - as in most countries, although 
  sometimes aspects of schemes will be devolved to the next layer down, as in 
  the US). Policy and regulations are set at national level even when administration 
  is managed locally, as with Housing Benefit. The UK government has now decided 
  to localise Council Tax Benefit policy and regulations at the same time as it 
  combines national in-work and out-of-work means-tested benefits in order to 
  enhance employment incentives. It will be interesting, and perhaps painful, 
  to watch the consequences of the interaction of a nationally regulated Universal 
  Credit and a locally regulated Council Tax Benefit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the Institute 
  does publish a volume on tax and benefits, then the editors might conclude that 
  ther<i>e are some aspects of welfare provision ripe for greater subsidiarity, 
  and some that require policy and regulations to be determined at the </i>highest 
  possible level of authority. We have seen trade rules becoming more continental 
  and global, and we are seeing calls for greater European involvement in such 
  fields as food safety; and it might be that at the same time as the governance 
  of such functions as social care and social housing become more local, taxation 
  and benefits policy and regulation should become increasingly global. The editors 
  might also decide that greater subsidiarity and increasing globalisation might 
  in some circumstances benefit each other, and that in particular the best way 
  to promote the ability of households and individuals to fulfil their own chosen 
  goals might be a European or global universal Citizen's Income. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As many of you 
  will be aware, on Thursday, 18 September 2014, the Scottish people will be invited 
  to vote in a referendum to decide 'Should Scotland be an independent country? 
  Yes/No'. In order to be prepared for such a momentous event, the Scottish Government 
  has set up an Expert Working Group on Welfare, comprising five members with 
  backgrounds in different areas of social policy. Mike Brewer is Professor of 
  Economics in the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University 
  of Essex, and also a Research Fellow at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Martyn 
  Evans, now Chief Executive of the Carnegie Trust, has experience from the Scottish 
  Consumer Council, CAB Scotland and Shelter. Douglas Griffin has been Director 
  of Finance in different NHS Trusts. Darra Singh OBE has worked for both Housing 
  Associations and for the DWP. Lynn Williams works for SCVO, and recently has

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Group's remit

  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">review and provide

</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the cost of 
    benefit payments in an independent Scotland upon independence</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the delivery 
    of those payments in an independent Scotland.<br>
    <br>
    The Group will also offer views on immediate priorities for change.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Organisations and 
  individuals were invited to submit evidence between 8 February and 8 March 2013. 
  Being a Scot based in Edinburgh, I made a personal submission to the Working 
  Group making the following points.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 'Call for Evidence' 
  paper of the Expert Working Group on Welfare is heavily geared towards asking 
  questions about how the current UK Social Security system (including the change 
  to Universal Credit) can be transferred to Scotland after Independence, particularly 
  with reference to the costs, and to its delivery of the benefits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The current UK 
  Social Security system, comprising a contributory National Insurance scheme 
  and means-tested safety-net (Social Assistance), is neither fair nor efficient, 
  and is an expensive method of keeping poor people still in poverty. It is not 
  just the below-poverty levels of benefit that prevent the benefit system from 
  delivering security, but also its complex and opaque structure. Together with 
  the UK's personal income tax system, it has helped to transfer income and wealth 
  from the poorest section of society into the pockets of the richest, over the 
  last three or four decades. It is a system that has been tried and failed, and 
  should not be imposed on the Scottish people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One of the reasons 
  why the Scottish people want Independence is so that they can create a much 
  fairer, more egalitarian society that reflects their values more accurately 
  than can be achieved under the current or future Westminster governments. While 
  adopting the current Social Security system initially may enable a smoother 
  transition from dependence to Independence, it is important for the Scottish 
  people to have a debate about the form of Social Security that would suit them, 
  comparing the merits and costs of the current UK Social Security system compared 
  with those of a Basic Income system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Centre for 
  Social Justice's report, <i>Dynamic Benefits: Towards welfare that works</i>, 
  (September 2009), correctly identified the main problems inherent in the current 
  system, and although it recognised that a Basic Income (BI), or Citizen's Income 
  (CI), scheme would tick all the required boxes, it eschewed this approach in 
  favour of marginal tinkering at the edges of the current system. (See <a href="http://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/publications/">www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/publications/</a>.) 
  The result is the Universal Credit, to be introduced between 2013-14 and 2017-18, 
  which will make marginal, rather than radical, changes to the Social Security 
  system, and will introduce an additional layer of complexity to the system. 
  The Westminster Government's Universal Credit proposals were reviewed in the 
  <i>Citizen's Income Newsletter</i>, 2011, issue 1, available from the CIT website. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The European Union 
  introduced a new procedure entitled a European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) in 
  April 2012, which enables groups of citizens from different countries across 
  the EU to register a request or proposal to the European Parliament. If registration 
  is accepted, then the group must obtain signatures from 1 million of the 500 
  million citizens of the EU within the following year in order for the proposal 
  to be put before the Parliament. Already a group of more than 50 people from 
  14 countries has gathered regularly, and on the 14th January 2013 they registered 
  an ECI on Unconditional Basic Income (UBI). They call for a UBI that is 1) universal, 
  2) individual, 3) unconditional and 4) 'high enough to ensure an existence in 
  dignity and participation in society'. For further information see <a href="http://basicincome2013.eu/%20and%20http://basicincome.be/act-support/the-eci-on-ubi/">http://basicincome2013.eu/ 
  and http://basicincome.be/act-support/the-eci-on-ubi/</a> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The introduction 
  of a UBI that is universal, individual, unconditional and high enough, does 
  not by itself define a complete system. Other details have to be added, such 
  as the actual level(s) of the BI, how it is financed, and with what other instruments 
  it should be coupled. A BI scheme can help to fulfil a number of objectives, 
  but by itself it cannot redistribute income from rich to poor. A restructured 
  personal income tax system is required to meet that objective. There is no one 
  optimum Basic Income scheme.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As I show in my 
  paper 'A rule-of-thumb Basic Income model for the UK', published in the last 
  edition of the <i>Citizen's Income Newsletter</i>:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a Citizen's 
    Income (CI) scheme can be designed to meet a set of stated objectives, according 
    to specified priorities.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">if financed 
    by a hypothecated, restructured, flat-rate or progressive, personal income 
    tax system (replacing both the current UK income tax and employees' National 
    Insurance contributions systems) in which there were no personal allowances 
    (apart from the CIs), no tax exemptions and no tax loop-holes, then an approximate 
    figure for the income tax rate required to finance the scheme can be calculated;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a simple Rule 
    of Thumb can be used for establishing the level of a Partial CI at 0.25 of 
    mean income per head, calculated from the latest available figures, and a 
    further 0.25 of mean income per head to top up the Partial CI to a Full CI, 
    for those whom a compassionate society would not compel to top up via earnings. 
    It is suggested that these include those over pension-entitlement age, those 
    with disabilities, unpaid carers-of-last-resort, and, as now, the responsible 
    parent of a dependent child (aged 0 - 15); </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">current higher 
    rate income tax-payers (2012-13) would lose very little, (5% of net income 
    at most, and the proportion decreases with gross income)<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">that those entitled 
    only to partial CIs could be allocated an initial tax-free tranche of gross 
    income until their net income schedule meets and merges with the Full CI schedule, 
    thus providing a progressive element in the income tax schedule (justifiable 
    on both equity and efficiency grounds)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">there is a variety 
    of potential levels for the Partial BIs, and of associated income tax rates 
    on the initial tranche of gross income before the Partial and Full CI schedules 
    meet and merge, any one of which could be introduced as an alternative without 
    changing the standard rate of income tax. This offers a remarkable degree 
    of flexibility.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">even fairly 
    generous BI schemes are economically feasible in the UK.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although the ideas 
  are illustrated with figures for the UK, the scheme is easily transferable to 
  other similar countries, including an independent Scotland.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With respect to 
  the transition from the current Social Security system to a CI scheme, a sector 
  approach would be feasible: to increase a universal Child Benefit to 0.25 of 
  mean income per head, first, followed by a Full CI for elderly people next (together 
  covering approximately 35% of the population), then to introduce CIs for the 
  working-age members of the population, and make changes to the personal income 
  tax system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The redistribution 
  aspect of the above scheme, reversing the trend of the last three and a half 
  decades, transferring funds from richer people, who have a larger propensity 
  to save, to poorer ones who will spend a higher proportion of their income, 
  is expected to boost demand. It would also help to regenerate run down local 
  economies, thus building up the national economy as a stable core, so that the 
  Scottish economy would not be so dependent on the vicissitudes of the global 
  economy. Reduced marginal deduction rates would increase incentives to work-for-pay 
  for people on low incomes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scotland differs 
  from England in several respects. One is the much smaller size of its population, 
  (5.25 million), most of it concentrated in the Central Belt, leaving vast tracts 
  of land relatively under-populated, with its own attendant problems. One should 
  look to other similar nations, such as the Nordic countries, for clues about 
  how to cope. Another difference is the Scottish demographic profile, resulting 
  from Scotland's most valuable export, its young and middle-aged educated people. 
  This was reflected in the mid-2010 population figures by a lower proportion 
  of children aged 0-15, and a slightly higher proportion of people aged 65 or 
  over, (although with a slightly lower proportion of people aged 80 or over), 
  compared with figures for the rest of the UK. It is important in the near future 
  to provide financial incentives to enable those Scots who wish to contribute 
  to an independent Scotland to do so. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is also important 
  that Scotland should provide an education system that has as its first aim that 
  of building the confidence and self esteem of all of its children, also imbuing 
  them with values of integrity and compassion, - caring for their neighbours, 
  - inculcating attitudes of pride in their work and reliability, and teaching 
  them life-skills. These must surely be the groundwork on which future employability, 
  and entrepreneurship, must be based. Another difference is that Scotland has 
  had a tradition of a large proportion of its population living in tenements, 
  or in public housing. Regulating the housing market so that houses become merely 
  homes once again, rather than speculative investments, could make home-ownership 
  accessible to a higher proportion of Scots than at present.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although an independent 
  Scotland might experience difficulties initially, while adjusting to becoming 
  a free nation again, I have every confidence in its prosperity in the future, 
  with its natural resources of renewable energy and water. However, its people 
  are its greatest assets, and investment in these must be the first priority 
  for the Scottish Government. It is important that a debate, comparing the relative 
  merits and costs of the current UK Social Security system and of an alternative 
  Citizen's Income system, should take place as soon as possible in Scotland.</font></p>

    non-withdrawable income for every individual as a right of citizenship. This 
    much-needed book, written by an experienced researcher and author, is the 
    first for over a decade to analyse the social, economic and labour market 
    advantages of a Citizen's Income in the UK. It demonstrates that it would 
    be simple and cheap to administer, would reduce inequality, enhance individual 
    freedom and would be good for the economy, social cohesion, families, and 
    the employment market. It also contains international comparisons and links 
    with broader issues around the meaning of poverty and inequality, making a 
    valuable contribution to the debate around benefits. Accessibly written, this
