                      CI virtues, however, political parties have also to anticipate 
                      negative <br>
                      criticism by seeking out and sealing any chinks in the CI

                      article shares some of the consequential controversies recently 
                      aired over the web by one Green Party. Any conclusions and

                      There are, presumably, several forms of CI. Our version 
                      would guarantee every citizen sufficient to provide basic 
                      needs of food, clothing, shelter and heating. Pensioners 
                      and the infirm receive extra payments, and there is to be 
                      a means-tested extra allowance for housing costs. Student 
                      grants would be restored. Detailed figures are promised 
                      before introduction and the whole appears to be funded at 
                      least initially through higher personal taxation and the 
                      ending of most other forms of social income. The case for 
                      favouring CI over, say, the present welfare payment system, 
                      actual CI levels, and definitions of 'citizen', 'basic' 
                      and 'sufficient' are to appear in supporting literature.<br>

                      The many advantages of CI (ending stigma, increasing up-take, 
                      etc) are well known to this readership, but that doesn't 
                      mean CIS is problem-free. Here, very briefly, are five stumbling 
                      blocks: </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A. 
                      its cost. There is no agreement yet about what level to 
                      set CI at, but assuming 56m people each receive an average 
                      of &pound;500 a month (and could one have much less if all 
                      the basics are to be covered?) the annual cost is &pound;336bn. 
                      That compares to UK's total government tax income for 2001 
                      of &pound;390bn, which leaves the Chancellor with a very 
                      large revenue 'black 'hole'. To fill this requires a substantial 
                      rise in income tax; the more so if, as some claim, claw-back 
                      from high earners offends basic CI principles. It is a discouragement 
                      that there still lacks a specimen set of government accounts 
                      which would set all the relevant finances into context.</font></p>

                      CI breaches GATT/WTO rules by subsidising wages. This means 
                      the UK will have to stop its international trading. One 
                      wonders if we greens, (and many of us interpret, and so 
                      despise, GATT/WTO as a 'profits-before-people' organisation) 
                      have fully thought this one through? One wonders, in effect, 
                      how much electoral support there will be for a policy that 
                      could destroy the British economy? In trying to solve the 
                      problems of wealth redistribution, radical parties almost 
                      always neglect the initial problem of wealth creation. A 
                      reply that a Green economy would solve this because it would 
                      be very different to the present economic system begs the 
                      response: first show me! </font></p>

                      CI will be inflationary. For example (as my own work many 
                      years ago on the effect of including the salaries of both 
                      partners for mortgage purposes showed) housing prices rise 
                      in company with the ability of people to pay them. In fact, 
                      the price of anything that is subsidised must, in an open 
                      economy, rise. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">D. 
                      For that last reason CI runs the danger of encouraging objectively 
                      <br>
                      undesirable conduct such as Wumpism, of which more later.

                      Abuse. There are several ways this can occur, but an obvious 
                      one is that children may not receive the benefits for which 
                      CI is intended to pay. I've heard it argued that as 'only 
                      a few' parents will spend the child's CI on drugs instead 
                      of food (and as 'this sort of thing takes place under the 
                      present system anyway') these occurrences aren't germane. 
                      This response strikes me as a cop-out. It is preferable 
                      (and makes more sense) to design out abuse than to turn 
                      an ineffectual eye to it. To that end we should recall that 
                      benefits already arrive in three <br>
                      ways: in kind (e.g. education, NHS); in cash (e.g. child 
                      allowances, the <br>
                      dole); and as vouchers (e.g. OAP fuel, travel passes). To 
                      ensure that <br>
                      children get fair play it seems to be worthwhile to at least 
                      discuss the <br>
                      possibility of specific vouchers for fresh food, good clothing 
                      and even <br>
                      adequate parenting. WW2 experience of the benefits of some 
                      of these <br>
                      practices is very favourable (which would in any case apply 
                      to increasingly few citizens). To resist a serious discussion 
                      about this because of perceived problems of added big-brotherism, 
                      bureaucracy, social control or 'whose opinion counts?' amounts 
                      to an ultimately self-defeating sweeping-under-the-carpet. 
                      Public means must only go on publicly approved ends. We 
                      must believe that where there is a will, there is a way.<br>

                      The delivery of CI has not anywhere been worked out satisfactorily. 
                      Some promote funding it from Land Value Taxation, but as 
                      this does not solve the actual delivery problem the LVT 
                      people do, in their enthusiasm to throw out income tax, 
                      also throw out a very useful baby with the bath water. Leaving 
                      aside the vices and virtues of personal taxation, the Inland 
                      Revenue Service already has, for CI purposes, a potentially 
                      vital data base and redistribution mechanism, namely positive 
                      and negative taxation. With every citizen identified (given 
                      suitable safeguards) on a modernised national computer and 
                      through the use of a fraud-proof smart card system, the 
                      transfer of money from those with too much to those with 
                      too little is much simplified, and few (if any) will be 
                      able to slip through the cracks.<br>

                      CI and universality versus selectivity. It has been argued 
                      that CI is a universal civil right, but accompanying civil 
                      rights are some often <br>
                      conveniently forgotten about civil duties. Our discussion 
                      has recently gone down the track of a debate about whether 
                      or not the Wilfully Unemployed, or Wumps, should receive 
                      CI only in return for a confirmed and regular working week 
                      of worthwhile (as defined by a citizens' jury) charitable 
                      (i.e. unpaid) work. The case for bowing to Wump self-exclusion 
                      from the work force (refusing to subsidize it, that is) 
                      includes a perceived need to reduce the work-shy culture; 
                      to support the growth of regular work habits; to benefit 
                      society through many more helpers, and a desire to improve 
                      the self-esteem of the erstwhile opted-out. It should be 
                      noted that carers, the infant, the infirm and the insane 
                      are exempted from the Wump category, as are those who wilfully 
                      don't work, but don't also demand benefits. The intention 
                      is not to force people to work, merely to refrain from subsidising 
                      laziness. The position of creative people has been seen 
                      as a problem case, but is it? Artists have only the same 
                      rights and duties as everyone else. It is a <br>
                      common observation that people will always find time to 
                      do the things they really want to do. An ordinary person 
                      can write several books and plays, complete several degrees, 
                      design and build a couple of houses, produce a lot of art 
                      work, and much else, all alongside forty five years of full-time 
                      work and a family. The case for subsidising Wumpism includes 
                      a stipulative definition of human rights that irrationally 
                      detaches rights from duties. It also makes a supposition 
                      that the numbers of Wumps will be so small (despite the 
                      everyday observation that the effect of subsidising things 
                      is to encourage them) as not to much matter. This is inconsistent, 
                      as the same numerically dismissive attitude is not also 
                      applied to, say, murder. There is a familiar challenge here 
                      to produce a system that designs out undesirable side effects 
                      and consequences. A tolerant regard for Wumpism serves only 
                      an underestimation of the cost to society of people deliberately 
                      opting out of worthwhile work. Given certain assumptions, 
                      my own calculations are that 125000 Wumps ( a low figure), 
                      deprive the UK economy of at least &pound;15bn annually. 
                      Such a figure spent correctly would in ten years solve our 
                      energy and transport problems, and probably more. That is 
                      a high opportunity cost to pay for a dubious extension to 
                      the valuable human rights principle. As most, if not all, 
                      existing benefits are handed out on the basis of dessert 
                      and need (as easily identified and dealt with through an 
                      enhanced Inland Revenue data base), the requirement upon 
                      CI advocates to justify not doing the same seems strong. 
                      For Green Parties there is the additional consideration 
                      that we believe in recycling 'rubbish', and so we cannot 
                      afford to ignore the need to also recycle fellow citizens 
                      who have <br>
                      been dumped on (or dumped themselves on) the human scrap 
                      heap.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      conclusion, the undoubted advantages of CI should blind 
                      no one (least of all those trying to sell CI to an ignorant 
                      and sceptical public) to its several apparent loose ends 
                      which need, therefore, to be tied up before rather than 
                      during or after an election. For some people, promoting 
                      CI is quite like a tout flogging tickets for seats on a 
                      potentially wonderful aeroplane, but one which both lacks 
                      engines and an even theoretically demonstrated airworthiness 
                      certificate. In short, to vote for CI at the moment may 
                      be akin to buying a pig in a poke. Shorter still, it appears 
                      the CI Emperor has few or no clothes.<br>
                      Naturally, I'm hoping most of the foregoing is wrong and 
                      that CI<br>
                      enthusiasts will so prove by sending me sensible, BRIEF, 
                      and foolproof data to the contrary (please, though, NOT 
                      mere opinions, speculations, statements by 'authorities', 
                      or books to read, as we're up to our ears in these already. 
                      What we really need is 'killer' evidence and peer-reviewed 
                      research). I will pass everything useable on to our debaters.</font></p>
