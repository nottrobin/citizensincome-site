                      he tackled during his lifetime remain issues today, and

                      Meade was one of the circle of young economists surrounding 
                      John Maynard Keynes during the 1930s. In 1937 be became 
                      editor of the World Economic Survey of the League of Nations; 
                      during the Second World War he joined the Economic Section 
                      of the Cabinet Office and became its Director at the age 
                      of 39; he was responsible for the 1944 White Paper on Employment 
                      Policy and the GATT negotiations; in 1947 he returned to 
                      academic life, first at the London School of Economics and 
                      then as Professor of Political Economy at Cambridge from 
                      1957 to 1967. In retirement he chaired the Meade Committee 
                      on the structure of direct taxation. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">For 
                      60 years, from the early 1930s to his death in 1995, James 
                      Meade studied the economy: the whole of the economy. He 
                      studied production, distribution, money, tax and benefits, 
                      the welfare state, and the economy's international dimensions; 
                      his interests spanned economics, history, social policy 
                      and politics; and although his thought developed in line 
                      with a changing political consensus, he consistently pursued 
                      themes established early on in his career: the need to stimulate 
                      demand in the economy in order to reduce unemployment; administrative 
                      and economic efficiency; the market as the efficient way 
                      to produce and distribute goods and services; the reduction 
                      of economic inequality; and (particularly latterly) the 
                      importance of individual freedom.<br>

                      our interest is the development of his thought or the substantial 
                      consistencies across 60 years, we shall find the 'social 
                      dividend' idea occurring over and over again, and occurring 
                      in relation to every one of Meade's major interests.<br>

                      1935, Meade wrote a paper for the Labour Party, <i>Outline 
                      of Economic Policy for a Labour Government</i>. In it he 
                      outlined four elements of the economic policy which he believed 
                      a future Labour government should pursue:</font></p>

                        the amount of the national income spent on consumption 
                        and the amount allocated to capital development. When 
                        even at very low interest rates very little development 
                        is profitable, a large proportion can be paid out as a 
                        social dividend; whereas if new and profitable fields 
                        of development appear a much larger part can be apportioned 
                        to the capital budget for this capital development. (3)</font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Thus 
                      right from the beginning Meade envisaged a 'social dividend' 
                      being precisely that: a distribution of corporate profits; 
                      but in his 1936 book, <i>An Introduction to Economic Analysis 
                      and Policy</i>, he suggested that a social dividend could 
                      be funded either by the profits of publicly-owned corporations 
                      or by income tax. (4)<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">One 
                      of Meade's abiding concerns was the efficiency of a system, 
                      and the economic efficiency of an equal social dividend 
                      for every citizen made the concept particularly attractive. 
                      In a review of Abba P. Lerner's <i>The Economics of Control</i>, 
                      (5) Meade wrote:<br>
                      </font></p>

                        Lerner argues &#133; that the total satisfaction achieved 
                        from any given income will be maximised if that income 
                        is so divided among individuals that its marginal utility 
                        is the same for everyone; but he adds an interesting and 
                        elegant proof of the proposition that (on the assumption 
                        that the marginal utility of income declines in the case 
                        of each individual) the maximisation of probable total 
                        satisfaction is attained by an equal division of income, 
                        even though we cannot directly compare the satisfactions 
                        of different individuals. (6)</font></p>

                      however important such efficiency might be, the maintenance 
                      of demand in the cause of reducing unemployment is a social

                      the reduction of unemployment and a more equal division 
                      of income and property - all in a single book, Planning

                        achieved in an efficient and a free society only if an

                        man, woman and child in the country - although the rate 
                        of payment might, of course, be lower for children than 
                        for adults. This would take the place of all social security 
                        benefits, such as unemployment benefit, old-age pensions, 
                        health benefits, children's allowances. Every man, woman 
                        and child would thus have his or her basic minimum whether 
                        in sickness or in health, in work or out of work, young 
                        or old. There need be no means test and no tests whether 
                        a man was seeking work or whether a man was genuinely 
                        ill. Doctors could stop writing out health certificates 
                        and get on with their job of curing their patients. Employment 
                        exchanges would stop fussing about unemployment insurance 
                        and get on with their job of introducing employers with 
                        vacancies to workers without jobs. The Ministry of National

                        tax. All income (other than the 'personal allowances'

                      later works offer little new on the social dividend except 
                      by way of emphasis. (15) <i>The Controlled Economy</i>, 
                      published in 1971, returned to a social dividend's demand-generating 
                      function, and added that 'there would be no insuperable 
                      administrative difficulty in reducing the payments in times 
                      of unexpected inflationary pressures and increasing them 
                      in times of unexpected deflationary pressures.' (16) In 
                      1975 Meade returned to the problem of funding a social dividend. 
                      Without telling us where the figure comes from, he suggested 
                      that a 50% income tax rate would be needed for a social 
                      dividend at Supplementary Benefit (now Income Support) levels 
                      and, believing that this would be a disincentive if imposed 
                      across a broad wages spectrum, suggested a 75% rate on the 
                      first slice of earned income, which would allow a rate below 
                      50% on the rest. (17) Again, the administrative simplicity 
                      of a social dividend is stressed (and particularly the simplifying 
                      effect of an individual-based rather than a household-based 
                      system); and again we find a social dividend proposed because 
                      it would enable market-mechanisms to work more freely. (18) 
                      (19)<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Meade's 
                      somewhat Keynesian programme had had some influence on post-war 
                      economic policy in this country; but he rightly recognised 
                      that by the late 1970s a great deal had changed. No longer 
                      did investment mean more jobs (indeed, it could mean fewer 
                      jobs); no longer could Government fix prices and wages (except 
                      in utilities over which they had some control); and no longer 
                      would increased spending power automatically translate into 
                      demand for this country's goods. Meade recognised that now 
                      'much more attention must be paid to measures other than 
                      price and wage setting in order to achieve a fair and acceptable 
                      distribution of income and property.' (20) Again, a social 
                      dividend is his instrument of choice.<br>

                      <i>Agathotopia</i>, published in 1989, is, according to 
                      Walter van Trier, an 'intellectual testimony' which 'presents 
                      the results of a long intellectual career dedicated to the 
                      search for an institutional framework congenial to his view 
                      of a good economic life - a view resting on a deeply rooted 
                      life-long moral conviction based on the equal importance 
                      of liberty, equality and efficiency.' (21) In <i>Agathotopia</i>, 
                      Meade foresees a time when each of us will receive income 
                      from a variety of sources: labour shares (issued to workers 
                      and producing dividends reflecting the firm's profits); 
                      capital shares; wages; and a social dividend - the social 
                      dividend being particularly important as a stable element 
                      making it less of a problem when the other income elements 
                      fluctuate. (22) The aim of the social dividend is 'the promotion 
                      of equality, the alleviation of risk-bearing, the improvement 
                      of incentives for low earners, and the simplification of 
                      the welfare state.' (23)<br>

                      <i>Agathotopia</i>, Meade offers a detailed description 
                      of how a transition to a social dividend might be possible, 
                      (24) and again suggests a 'surcharge' on the first slice 
                      of earned income in order to make the scheme affordable. 
                      (25) His conclusion is that<br>
                      the higher the social dividend and the higher the general 
                      rate of tax imposed to finance it, the greater will be the 
                      beneficial effects on the equalisation of adjusted incomes 
                      and on the mitigation of risk-bearing. But both the rise 
                      in the social dividend (which enables people to enjoy a 
                      given income without earning so much) and the higher marginal 
                      rate of tax (which reduces the net return on any additional 
                      earnings) will tend to reduce economic incentives for work 
                      and enterprise. In the choice of policies these results 
                      must be weighed against each other. (26)<br>

                      however much Meade grapples with the problems posed by the 
                      attempt to fund a social dividend out of tax revenue, he 
                      has not given up hope of a social dividend being what it 
                      says it is: a distribution of profits produced by the national 
                      asset (which he hopes might one day replace the national 
                      debt), an asset made up of shares owned by the State and 
                      possibly whole companies owned by the State but not managed 
                      by it. An excellent summary of this position can be found

                        which can be used to finance adequate social benefits

                        at the lower end of the income scale. This raises a serious 
                        danger of introducing disincentives into the productive 
                        system. If the social benefits are confined strictly to 
                        the support of those in poverty, the system will inevitably 
                        lead to serious disincentives in the form of the well-known 
                        poverty trap, since any additional earnings will be offset 
                        by withdrawal of social benefits as the recipients work 
                        themselves out of poverty.<br>

                        incomes needed for their finance would become intolerably 
                        high - perhaps implying a rise from 25% to 80% in the 
                        basic rate of income tax. The disincentive effects at

                        should allow free national experimentation in these policies 
                        but should itself introduce and administer a positive 
                        form of egalitarian intervention of its own. For example, 
                        it might itself raise a general community levy or tax 
                        of some form and use the proceeds to pay a modest Basic 
                        Income to all the citizens of the member countries. The 
                        national governments could be left to top this up with 
                        their different national schemes. Movements of people 
                        and capital would ... put a brake on the most extreme 
                        egalitarian experiments; but the existence of the modest 
                        Community scheme would mean that the outcome of the competition 
                        between the national experiments would be less markedly 
                        inegalitarian than would otherwise have been the case. 
                        This solution would permit more national experimentation 
                        and would involve a less complicated central bureaucratic 
                        apparatus than ... solution through centrally administered 
                        full national harmonisation. (31)</font></p>

                      in this instance too there is continuity and development, 
                      the development being a response to changing times, the 
                      continuity being a reflection of Meade's continuing pursuit 
                      of both the free market and a more equal society in an international 
                      context.<br>
                      Meade was a child of his time, and thus believed that the 
                      abolition of unemployment was the route to the abolition 
                      of both idleness and poverty, of both Idleness and Want. 
                      (32) By 1981 he had recognised that the technological revolution 
                      had created a new situation in which either wages and unemployment 
                      would rise together or wages would decline and inequality 
                      grow. (33) In fact, both of these things have happened in 
                      different sectors of the economy.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It 
                      is a pity that Meade's final book, <i>Full Employment Regained?</i> 
                      did not take sufficient account of the impact of technological 
                      change on the structure of the labour market. It might be 
                      that 'full employment' in the traditional sense is no longer 
                      an option - and, moreover, that it ought not to be an option. 
                      In <i>Agathotopia</i> we see Meade grappling with a new 
                      structure for the relationship between labour and capital 
                      - but he is still in the world of today's kind of capital-intensive 
                      and labour-intensive large company, whereas the trajectory 
                      of technological change is towards increasing diversity 
                      of style, size and type of enterprise.<br>
                      We cannot blame Meade for failing to tackle tomorrow's problems. 
                      We can only thank him for proposing a social dividend as 
                      a partial solution to the problems of the years from 1935 
                      to 1995 - and ourselves continue to work on the concept 
                      in the knowledge that it might be even more relevant to 
                      the new situations in which we find ourselves at the beginning 
                      of a new millennium. </font></p>

                      13 Meade was writing at a time when the low-paid paid no 
                      income tax - so a social dividend, by reducing tax allowances, 
                      would have brought much of the low-paid's income above the 
                      tax threshold for the first time and would thus have imposed 
                      a poverty trap. Now there are few employees who pay no income 
                      tax, so this objection no longer applies to the same extent.<br>

                      19 It was the administrative complexity of a Negative Income 
                      Tax which led Meade to reject it, even though it would have 
                      had many of the same effects as a social dividend (for instance, 
                      on the poverty and unemployment traps). See particularly 
                      his discussion comparing social dividend and negative income 
                      tax in Poverty in the Welfare State (<i>Oxford Economic

                      System</i> (Routledge, 1989), p.149. Meade's conclusion 
                      is that a social dividend does not need to adjust to changes 
                      in someone's other income or in their labour market status, 
                      whereas a negative income tax does.<br>
