                <b> <b>Housing costs</b></b><br>
                Discussion on the reform of benefits and taxation frequently avoids 
                the issue of housing benefit. This should not surprise us, as 
                there can be no more complex benefit. It is the only part of the 
                benefits system which has ever seized up completely (in the mid-'80s, 
                when an attempt at reform resulted in Housing Benefit Supplement, 
                the collapse of the system, and the reform's abandonment); it 
                is the only part of the system which has to cope with variables 
                unrelated to personal circumstances (because housing costs vary 
                so widely across the country); and it is the only part of the 
                system currently suffering under four distinct transitional arrangements.<br>
                It is therefore to the credit of the Pivot Initiative that it 
                has issued a well-argued report on the reform of housing benefit 
                (see the news item below). The reforms proposed would be genuine 
                simplifications of the system, and the cost to the exchequer of 
                these reforms would be modest. The suggestion that both housing 
                benefit and council tax benefit should not be withdrawn at the 
                same time would be particular helpful as it would increase the 
                rate at which net income rises as earned income rises and would 
                therefore improve incentives to seek employment and to increase 
                earnings once in employment.<br>
                Of longer term interest is the more radical proposal for housing 
                allowances, comprising a flat-rate element and an element calculated 
                as a proportion of actual rent paid. This reform would turn housing 
                benefit recipients into participants in a market, leading to greater 
                efficiency in the allocation of housing. <br>
                But the radical question which is not asked is this: If it is 
                beneficial to reduce the effects of means-testing, then why not 
                seek to abandon means-testing altogether ? The contribution to 
                the debate later in this edition suggests precisely this.</p>

                <b>The launch of the Pivot Initiative's report Hope for Housing 
                Benefit: a strategy for housing benefit reform.</b><br>
                The Pivot Initiative was established a year ago at Centrepoint, 
                the national youth homelessness and social exclusion charity, 
                by Peter Dawe, entrepreneur and founder of Unipalm-Pipex, the 
                internet company, to research means of reducing the marginal tax 
                rates experienced by people on low incomes. Its major interest 
                has been the reform of housing benefit, and to this end its Director, 
                Daniel Brewer, has edited a report, Hope for Housing Benefit, 
                which was launched on Wednesday 7th November at the Institute 
                for Public Policy Research. <br>
                At the event Sue Regan (IPPR) welcomed a diverse group of MPs, 
                civil servants, journalists and representatives of voluntary organisations. 
                Lord Adebowale (former Chief Executive Officer of Centrepoint 
                and now Chief Executive Officer of Turning Point) spoke about 
                the difficulties which the housing benefit system poses for young 
                people, and the difficulties involved in understanding and reforming 
                the system. Daniel Brewer introduced the report, which suggests 
                a number of reforms which would simplify the housing benefit system 
                and at the same time reduce the poverty trap which the system 
                currently imposes on low earners.<br>
                Currently 4.6m people receive housing benefit, so there are 4.6m 
                people who experience rapid withdrawal of the benefit as their 
                earned income rises, and a lot of people who suffer a disincentive 
                to seek employment or to increase their earnings once in employment. 
                If employment is to be a major means of lifting people out of 
                poverty, then housing benefit is a problem.<br>
                The report makes several proposals:<br>
                Extended payment periods: Housing benefit currently runs on into 
                new employment for four weeks, but there are conditions attached 
                to the run-on. To remove the conditions would ease the transition 
                into employment;<br>
                Nondependent deductions: Other adults living in someone's home 
                are currently means-tested (a means-test within a means-test), 
                and if information on their earnings is not available then the 
                maximum nondependent deduction is applied to housing benefit claims. 
                The report proposes a small flat-rate deduction for earning nondependents 
                and no deduction at all for nonearning nondependents. This would 
                reduce the risk of nondependent young adults being asked to leave 
                home;<br>
                Longer payment periods: At the moment, any change in circumstances 
                triggers a reassessment of housing benefit. Working Families Tax 
                Credit is based on a 12-month payment period during which minor 
                changes are ignored. The report suggests that for housing benefit 
                a 6-month payment period during which minor changes would be ignored 
                would simplify administration;<br>
                Combining Council Tax Benefit and Housing Benefit tapers: At the 
                moment, as other income rises, both council tax benefit and housing 
                benefit are withdrawn together, contributing to a total withdrawal 
                rate of 85%. This is a disincentive to seeking employment. The 
                report proposes that council tax benefit should be paid at the 
                full rate until housing benefit has been completely withdrawn, 
                and that only then should council tax benefit begin to be withdrawn. 
                This would result in a withdrawal rate of 65% throughout, giving 
                many families a net weekly income &pound;20 higher than at present;<br>
                The elimination of earnings disregards: The disregards are extremely 
                small and thus provide no real incentive to seek employment. They 
                should either be increased or withdrawn. The report suggests that 
                the taper be reduced by 10% at the same time as the disregards 
                are removed, thus increasing incentives over a broad income range 
                and reducing them only for those earning very little. <br>
                Housing allowances: At the moment, housing benefit is related 
                directly to actual rent paid, but in each area the rent levels 
                on which calculations are based are restricted. Many people cannot 
                find accommodation at the maximum rent level allowed, so they 
                have to find some of the rent themselves. The report recommends 
                that in the longer term housing benefit should be replaced by 
                housing allowances made up of a flat rate element (related in 
                each area to average rent levels) and an element proportional 
                to the actual rent paid. This would protect people who could only 
                find expensive accommodation, at the same time as giving people 
                an incentive to seek cheaper accommodation should it become available. 
                <br>
                The report contains graphs showing the effects of some of the 
                listed changes on net incomes, and a table showing how the implementation 
                of the different proposals might be related to a timetable.</p>
              <p>Debate following the presentation ranged widely over the provision 
                of housing, differences in costs throughout the country, the difficulties 
                faced by pensioners who would lose from the proposals (such as 
                owner-occupiers on council tax benefit but not on housing benefit), 
                the relationship between high housing costs and low take-up of 
                working families tax credits, and applying a housing allowance 
                system to home-owners as well as tenants.<br>
                Anthony Lawton, the new Chief Executive Officer of Centrepoint, 
                declined to sum up the discussion, instead reflecting on the difficulty 
                of the subject and the importance of tackling the problem.</p>

              <p><b>The inaugural conference for the Centre for Microdata Methods 
                and Practice ('cemmap')</b><br>
                On Thursday 6th December, the new Centre for Microdata Methods 
                and Practice, a joint venture between the Institute for Fiscal 
                Studies and the Department of Economics at University College 
                London, was launched with a conference entitled 'Microdata Methods 
                and Practice: Perspectives and Priorities'. Speakers included 
                Professor Andrew Chesher, Director of the new center; Andrew Dilnot, 
                Director of the IFS; Baroness Sarah Hogg (Chairman, Frontier Economics, 
                and previously head of the Downing Street Policy Unit from 1990 
                to 1995); Evan Davis, Economics Editor, BBC; Professor Richard 
                Blundell, of the IFS and UCL; and Sir Andrew Turnbull, Permanent 
                Secretary to the Treasury.<br>
                Sir Andrew's presentation was particularly relevant to discussion 
                of the reform of tax and benefits. He outlined the Treasury's 
                policy of basing reform on evidence, and introduced 1.the Treasury's 
                'Evidence for policy choice' website, 2. its evidence based policy 
                fund, and 3. the evidence based policy cycle, which implies the 
                following process: data ? analysis/review ? research ? policy 
                thinking ? consultation/testing ? enactment ? set-up evaluation 
                ? delivery ? outcome ? data. <br>
                Given the resources, the Citizen's Income Trust could clearly 
                make a substantial contribution to all stages of this cycle up 
                to the 'consultation/testing' stage.</p>

              <p><b>Jay Ginn, <i>From Security to Risk: Pension privatisation 
                and gender inequality</i> </b>(London: Catalyst, December 2001) 
                (Catalyst is at P.O. Box 27477, London SW9 8WT, telephone 020 
                7733 2111, email catalyst@catalyst-trust.co.uk, website www.catalyst-trust.co.uk).<br>
                The introduction to this paper reveals just how small women's 
                financial resources are in retirement compared with men's. (The 
                statistical evidence reveals a divide far larger than this reviewer 
                realised). This gulf, which relates particularly to occupational 
                and private pension provisions, means that women are more reliant 
                on a state pension than men are.<br>
                The paper also reveals significant continuities in government 
                policy on pensions, with the change in government in 1997 seeming 
                to make little difference to the consensus that private provision 
                (with public subsidy) should grow and that the state Basic Pension 
                should decline in real terms. Both of these trends disadvantage 
                women.<br>
                Another serious trend is towards means-testing. Because of the 
                advent of the Minimum Income Guarantee, by 2003 half of all pensioners 
                will suffer means-testing; and, combined with the fact that Britain 
                has a lower state pension than most other OECD countries, this 
                is bound to affect the willingness of people on low incomes to 
                save for their old age. <br>
                Ginn suggests that it needn't be like this:<br>
                &quot;There are better alternatives, even in liberal welfare states. 
                For example, New Zealand provides a tax-funded citizen's pension 
                at age 65 to each resident, irrespective of employment record. 
                The amount is 34 per cent of average net earnings for each married 
                person and 44 per cent for lone pensioners. In 1998 this was equivalent 
                to over &pound;100 per week for a lone pensioner (using Purchasing 
                Power Parities). As a result, New Zealand's men's and women's 
                incomes in retirement are roughly equal. One reason New Zealand 
                has the resources to provide a citizen's pension for all is that 
                there is no tax relief on private pensions. Denmark also provides 
                a citizen's pension higher than Britain's Basic Pension, although 
                only at age 67.<br>
                &quot;Closer to home, Ireland has a higher basic pension than 
                Britain. In 1998 it was equivalent to &pound;91 per week (29 per 
                cent of average industrial earnings) and it is being increased 
                faster than prices.<br>
                &quot;Scrapping the NI system and replacing it with a citizen's 
                pension set at an adequate level would avoid the increasingly 
                complex calculations of entitlements in the NI pension schemes. 
                For women, it would have the added advantage of rewarding unpaid 
                and paid work over the life course equally, allowing older women 
                the dignity of an income of their own and improving gender equality 
                in retirement incomes,&quot; (p.15).<br>
                Ginn also offers some less radical suggestions, such as raising 
                the Basic Pension to Minimum Income Guarantee level; but the argument 
                of the paper leads inexorably towards the conclusion that a citizen's 
                pension is the best way to provide an income for elderly people 
                in such a way that the inequalities between men and women before 
                retirement might not be perpetuated after it.</p>
              <p><b>David Piachaud and Jo Webb, <i>Social Security and the Changing 
                Labour Market</i></b> (Trades Union Congress, October 2001, &pound;10, 
                ISBN 1 85006 582 9).<br>
                Social security has an economic function, as it reduces exclusion, 
                encourages risk-taking, and reduces the crime-related costs of 
                inequality. The problem is the cost, and the pressure (greater 
                as globalisation affects our economy) to reduce labour costs and 
                thus taxes on income from labour. But Piachaud and Webb find no 
                'race to the bottom', and suggest that there won't be one, as 
                too many workers rely on social protection. Similarly, the authors 
                find that there is no simple 'dependency culture'.<br>
                The paper contains some other interesting findings: that there 
                is no clear relationship between social protection spending and 
                economic growth; that UK benefit levels are lower than in most 
                European countries; and that, whilst the UK spends 27% of GDP 
                on social protection, this has less impact on poverty than lower 
                spending has in some other countries.<br>
                The lack of a clear relationship between social protection spending 
                and economic growth, and the UK's low benefit levels, between 
                them suggest that the UK could increase benefit levels without 
                damaging economic performance.<br>
                On 'the family' as the major source of social protection, the 
                authors write: &quot;For social protection in Britain the family 
                remains the basic unit of account. Indeed with the extension of 
                means testing with the Working Families Tax Credit and the pensioners' 
                Minimum Income guarantee the family unit on which benefit entitlement 
                is assessed is becoming increasingly important. The promotion 
                and subsidy of low-paid work through the Working Families Tax 
                Credit is a key component of the strategy to eliminate child poverty 
                within a generation. This involves a recognition that many parents 
                cannot rely solely on universal benefits nor are they able to 
                take full-time employment or obtain a job that pays above the 
                poverty level. This family-focused subsidy in Britain is in contrast 
                to the measures in many countries to ensure that all individuals 
                have adequate social protection in their own right. &#133;.. in 
                many European countries this depends on extending social insurance 
                to those who are part-time or very low paid and to those with 
                interrupted working lives due to care of children or of disabled 
                relatives. Britain has tended to move in the opposite direction, 
                leaving those with little or no social insurance to depend on 
                the means-tested Income Support Scheme. For those who do or will 
                depend on Income Support there is little incentive to earn or 
                save. More fundamentally the family-based means test undermines 
                individual entitlements and serves to encourage family break-up,&quot; 
                (p.16).<br>
                Similarly, the authors criticise the British system for not adapting 
                to changing employment patterns: &quot;Where employment is changing 
                towards short-term contracts, individually negotiated pay and 
                conditions, portfolio working and reduced occupational welfare 
                the result is increased insecurity and more dependence on social 
                protection. If employment is no longer life-long, then relying 
                on occupational welfare for protection when sick or old is less 
                and less possible. Social protection in many countries is adapting 
                to changing work patterns. In Britain only minor adaptations have 
                been made and then largely as a result of adverse rulings of the 
                European Court,&quot; (p.17).<br>
                On globalisation, the authors suggest that, &quot;considering 
                the increased insecurity that globalisation seems likely to engender, 
                the balance of political pressure will most probably shift towards 
                improving social protection,&quot; (p.19).<br>
                The paper calculates the cost of catching up with the rest of 
                Europe in terms of spending, and concludes: &quot;Globalisation 
                presents many challenges to welfare states. Yet we have seen that 
                it requires us to sustain our levels of social protection, not 
                reduce them. There is no evidence that increasing social provision 
                would harm economic efficiency, and much to suggest that it would 
                have beneficial effects on poverty and social harmony. The experience 
                of some of our European neighbours suggests that the twin objectives 
                of high economic growth and low poverty rates can be achieved 
                simultaneously. Britain would do well to follow their example,&quot; 
                (p.20).<br>
                The logic of the paper leads to the conclusion that the additional 
                spending needs to be on non-means-tested, individualised benefits 
                not linked to particular labour market statuses.</p>

                Union Congress, &pound;7.50, ISBN 1 85006 583 7). <br>
                This paper concludes that &quot;the clear correlation between 
                a country's social protection spending and its poverty rate, and 
                the lack of a correlation between poverty rates and employment 
                rates indicates equally clearly that employment cannot be the 
                whole answer to poverty. Workless families in the UK are far more 
                likely to be poor than their counterparts in other European countries, 
                and this must be related to the level of social protection in 
                different countries,&quot; (p.11). So &quot;welfare-to-work policies, 
                however effective, cannot substitute for adequate social protection 
                spending,&quot; (p.9). The major casualties of a welfare-to-work 
                policy are those children living in households where parents are 
                not available for work, for whatever reason ,&quot; (p.13)).</p>

                in Benefits, issue 31 May/June 2001, pp.10-13. <br>
                &quot;Targeting of social security benefits has always been an 
                integral part of social welfare policies. The introduction of 
                the term 'targeting' into the current policy discourse is, however, 
                of recent usage. All social benefit programs in the past were, 
                in one way or another, targeted to serve specifically defined 
                population groups, whether those in actual need or those at risk 
                of being in need. There have never been programs that operated 
                in an entirely indiscriminate manner in distributing their benefits. 
                Resources have always been scarce and the main task of policy 
                makers has been how to make best use of the limited resources 
                available for social benefits. The policy issue is thus not whether 
                targeting is necessary but how can it achieve the policy goals 
                in the most effective manner,&quot; (p.10).<br>
                The author discusses in detail the different targeting methods 
                used in Israel, and concludes that targeting is done mainly by 
                aiming benefits at particular demographic groups (children and 
                pensioners) rather than by means-testing. As well as being targeted 
                at groups which tend to be in relative need, these non-meanstested 
                benefits aimed at these groups can be regarded as 'targeted' in 
                the sense that the benefit will be a higher proportion of income 
                for those with fewer other financial resources than for those 
                with higher financial resources.<br>
                The article concludes: &quot;The major issue in the debate &#133;.. 
                is not targeting in itself, because the need for targeting has 
                always been recognised and accepted in practice. The issue is 
                whether targeting takes place within programs designed to cater 
                to the poor and low-income groups only through the use of means 
                and income testing at the point of access, or if targeting is 
                achieved within broader universal benefit systems and on the basis 
                of group status criteria, without means-testing, proved to be 
                more viable than the recourse to means testing and other individual 
                behaviour criteria. The Israeli experience, for example, gives 
                ample support for this view,&quot; (p.13).<br>
                The article raises the question as to how the word 'targeting' 
                should be used in debate in this country. The author defines 'targeting' 
                as the directing of resources to serve particular groups. Thus 
                Child Benefit is targeted: on children. If, as the article suggests, 
                targeting means directing resources disproportionately towards 
                certain groups, then a Citizen's Income could be regarded as a 
                means of targeting on people with low incomes, as its effect would 
                be that of providing a higher proportion of net income for poorer 
                families than for wealthier families and it would thus be directed 
                disproportionately towards poorer families.</p>
              <p><b>Social Policy and Administration, volume 35, December 2001, 
                no.5</b>.<br>
                This special issue of Social Policy and Administration on 'Environmental 
                Issues and Social Welfare' invites those of us who are interested 
                in the reform of social security benefits and taxation to think 
                again about the link between these concerns and the sustainability 
                of the planet. Of particular interest is the paper by Tony Fitzpatrick 
                entitled 'Making Welfare for Future Generations'. Fitzpatrick 
                summarises his own theory on intergenerational justice in which 
                he develops a principle of 'sustainable justice' which recognises 
                &quot;the long-term mutuality of intragenerational and intergenerational 
                equity: the former without the latter is unsustainable; the latter 
                without the form is undesirable,&quot; (p.508). He looks for social 
                policies which might serve the interests of both the present and 
                the future poor, and suggests collective ownership of pension 
                funds. <br>
                Fitzpatrick locates the link between this discussion of sustainable 
                justice and environmental issues in the principle that &quot;substitutables 
                should only be utilized if the welfare thereby created is subject 
                to an egalitarian distribution [because] the depletion of a substitutable 
                has implications for everyone, therefore everyone should be able 
                to benefit from it on a scale that current property rights do 
                not permit,&quot; (p.513). He discusses the Alaskans' distribution 
                of oil revenues to every resident as a social dividend - and suggests 
                that it has few environmental credentials.<br>
                This of course reveals the problem: that the paper is about two 
                separate issues: environmental issues, and social justice (though 
                social justice in an intergenerational context). As Fitzpatrick 
                recognises when he discusses the use of a field for either a car 
                park or a conservation park, it is the particular kind of tax 
                regime chosen which will determine whether the environmental justice 
                is served.<br>
                Of particular interest in this respect is Meg Huby's article, 
                'The Sustainable Use of Resources on a Global Scale', which includes 
                a discussion of the consumption of energy in wealthy and poor 
                countries, and which recommends carbon taxes which, she believes, 
                &quot;could pay huge environmental dividends and provide revenue 
                for improving social assistance schemes,&quot; (p.533). <br>
                Maybe it's time to revisit the idea of a Citizen's Income paid 
                for by imposing a carbon tax. Such an arrangement ( - particularly 
                if either established or regulated on a Europe-wide basis) would 
                serve intragenerational, intergenerational and environmental justice, 
                whilst at the same time contributing to the efficiency of the 
                labour market: an issue which some suggested policies take less 
                into account.</p>

                This is a report on research carried out in a participative fashion 
                in a deprived area of Bristol. Through focus groups, local people 
                identified the difficulties they face when they attempt to gain 
                access to financial services. The researchers then put the questions 
                raised to providers of financial services; an audit of financial 
                provision in the neighbourhood was undertaken; and finally groups 
                of local people questioned financial providers, evaluated the 
                responses received, and identified priorities for action.<br>
                Banking, loans, savings, loans for micro-entrepreneurs, financial 
                services for Muslim Somalis, and financial information and education, 
                were identified as priorities; and the new basic bank accounts 
                offered by Natwest ('Steps') and the Bank of Scotland ('Easycash') 
                were regarded as meeting local needs, as was the proposed universal 
                bank account to be operated through Post Offices.<br>
                The research was carefully conducted, with genuine local participation; 
                and the conclusions drawn will be helpful to the providers of 
                financial services as they seek to serve poorer communities.<br>
                What is now required is in-depth research on how people in more 
                deprived communities do actually manage their finances, along 
                the lines of Jordan et al's research in Exeter into the ways in 
                which low-income families make decisions about sources of income. 
                (Bill Jordan, Simon James, Helen Kay and Marcus Redley, Trapped 
                in Poverty? Labour-market decisions in low-income households (Routledge, 
                1992)). In this way the detail as well as the broad outline of 
                what is required will become clearer.<br>
                Bill Jordan's conclusion was that low-income families operate 
                as if means-tested benefits were non-withdrawable benefits, until 
                earned income reaches a certain level, at which point earned income 
                is declared and means-tested benefits lost or reduced. The decriminalisation 
                which reducing means-testing would achieve is a strong argument 
                for establishing a small and growing Citizen's Income. <br>
                Any future research into financial services provision will need 
                to address this question: How are decisions about which financial 
                services to access linked to decisions about how income sources 
                are managed? For instance: Is a family receiving means-tested 
                benefits and undeclared casual earnings less likely to open a 
                bank-account than a low-earning family not in receipt of benefits? 
                If so, then the conclusion which Jordan et al draws has relevance 
                to any future debate on the provision of financial serves in more 
                deprived areas.</p>

                Yamamori discusses redistribution as a process of entrance, game, 
                and exit, and the recognition of differences as a process of entrance, 
                communication, and exit. Interventions in the game or at the exit 
                perpetuate and strengthen boundaries between people (between women 
                and men, between independent people and dependent people, between 
                different racial groups, etc.). Only intervention at the entrance 
                will dissolve the boundaries. Most income maintenance instruments 
                apply during the game or at the exit, and so perpetuate and strengthen 
                boundaries. A Citizen's Income is applied at the entrance, and 
                so dissolves boundaries and reduces inequalities.</p>

                This book announces itself as a 'new edition' of the book Timmins 
                published in 1995, and any review of a new edition of a book is 
                inevitably also a review of the original edition, which was a 
                unique history of the welfare state, revealing what a remarkable 
                achievement it was and still is.<br>
                The introduction sets out both a plan and some of Timmins' conclusions. 
                He candidly admits that the book includes those things which interest 
                him, as any biography does; so, fortunately for the purposes of 
                this newsletter, the book contains more on social security benefits 
                than many other authors' biographies of the welfare state would 
                have done.<br>
                Timmins' initial conclusions are that there was no 'golden age'; 
                that social policy has always been driven by diverse and often 
                irreconcilable aims; that it is difficult to discover explicitly 
                labour or conservative approaches to reform; that the Beveridge 
                Report and its (partial) implementation were colossal achievements; 
                that anger at continuing inequality is highly appropriate; and 
                that change frequently results in unintended consequences ( - 
                there is a useful section in pp.282f on Family Income Supplement's 
                (FIS) tendency to depress wage rates and to increase the depth 
                of the 'poverty trap', which was first defined in relation to 
                FIS).<br>
                In a short review it is not possible to discuss the detail of 
                the historical argument of the remaining chapters. Instead, I 
                shall highlight those parts of the history and of Timmins' treatment 
                of it which will be of particular relevance to readers of this 
                newsletter.<br>
                The remarkable implementation and survival of Child Benefit runs 
                as a seam of gold through the book, and Timmins recognises the 
                importance of not means-testing it (as have politicians of various 
                political hues). Child Benefit was an important element in Beveridge's 
                plan to ensure that families would be better off in employment 
                than out of it, and this theme too runs throughout the history, 
                and particularly through the revised chapter 20 and the new chapter 
                21 in the new edition which discuss the recent New Deal, Working 
                Families Tax Credits (WFTC), and plans for tax credits for people 
                without dependent children. Similarly, Beveridge wanted most elderly 
                people to be on non-means-tested pensions, and governments are 
                still pursuing this goal by different means in order to maximise 
                personal savings for old age. (The proposed income guarantee for 
                pensioners will be a wrong turn in this respect).<br>
                Beveridge wanted a contributory scheme because he wanted every 
                employee to contribute as well as to receive. When he wrote his 
                report, only higher paid employees were paying income tax, so 
                national insurance contributions paid by every employee were the 
                obvious way to enable everyone to contribute. An important general 
                lesson to draw from Timmins' history is that a single aim can 
                often be met via different routes; and an important particular 
                lesson is that a tax-based social security system would now achieve 
                Beveridge's aim that everyone should contribute because now people 
                on relatively low incomes are paying income tax. <br>
                Beveridge's aim was a contributory 'platform' and a means-tested 
                'safety net', but because the rates of contributory benefits were 
                set at similar levels to those of means-tested benefits (National 
                Assistance, subsequently renamed Supplementary Benefit and then 
                Income Support), and because means-tested benefits included housing 
                costs and contributory benefits did not, by 1954 the 'safety net' 
                was supporting 1,800,000 people. As we shall see, the position 
                has worsened since then.<br>
                An interesting subplot is the way in which radical proposals have 
                frequently been made, often several times, before being implemented. 
                Labour's manifesto of 1964 contained a pledge to integrate tax 
                and benefits and thus abolish means-tests for pensioners, and 
                then for others (p.225); in 1974 the Conservative government was 
                working on tax credits; and the Working Families Tax Credit integrates 
                a means-test with income tax assessment for some employees. The 
                possibility of a Citizen's Income scheme gets a mention in this 
                context - but the book is biography, not prophecy, so we should 
                not expect Timmins to have explored this possibility further. 
                (Maybe he should write another book).<br>
                From 1978 onwards a note of defeatism enters the story as governments 
                continually adjusted and renamed means-tested benefits rather 
                than seeking to replace them with something different. (The account 
                of the 1983 Housing Benefit Supplement fiasco is particularly 
                revealing). Norman Fowler's 1986 review was intended to be radical, 
                but the outcome wasn't (though it did for the first time apply 
                the same means test to in-work, out-of-work and housing benefits, 
                making the poverty trap shallower but wider).<br>
                It is a pity that the new edition no longer contains interesting 
                tables to be found in the original edition; but interesting figures 
                in the original chapter 20 are still there in the new edition, 
                and they show that by 1992 there were 5.6m people on Income Support, 
                which, when dependents are included, means 20% of the population. 
                The figure was 4% in 1948. Both editions, in different ways, reveal 
                increasing inequality, with the new edition recognising that recent 
                policies have at least arrested the acceleration of inequality 
                for those on the lowest incomes.<br>
                It is often difficult to discuss such recent developments objectively, 
                but Timmins has useful sections on developments in social security 
                policy at the end of the last Conservative administration and 
                during New Labour's first period in office. The continuities are 
                interesting, and particularly those relating to attempts to provide 
                incentives to work and to attempts to reduce means-testing. Also 
                useful is the recognition that Beveridge's scheme was a development 
                rather than a revolution and that the search for a 'big idea' 
                to solve the problems facing the social security system has (so 
                far) ended in failure. The unthinkable has not yet been thought 
                by governments, even if various unthinkables have been thought 
                by various individuals and think-tanks.<br>
                An interesting outcome of recent developments is an increase in 
                means-testing (for Working Families Tax Credits is better described 
                as a means-tested benefit than as any other kind, and the pensioner 
                income guarantee will be one too); and Timmins concludes that 
                universal provision is having a hard time of it and will continue 
                to do so.<br>
                This new edition of Timmins' 'biography of the welfare state' 
                is essential reading for anyone interested in the current debate 
                on social security reform, a debate which must now be linked with 
                that on income tax reform. Whilst a Citizen's Income approach 
                to the problem is currently not high on the agenda, Timmins' book 
                shows that the issues amongst which this approach operates are 
                precisely those within which debate on the future of social security 
                is taking place: incentives to seek employment and to save; income 
                maintenance; housing costs; complexity; inequality; responsibility 
                to contribute &#133;&#133; And he also shows that Beveridge's 
                aim was to provide a 'platform' on which people could build (because 
                to provide a platform is to encourage individual effort) and that 
                our social security system is no longer true to this vision because 
                its chief instrument is a set of means-tested safety-nets. Beveridge 
                would have wanted us to seek a new 'platform'. <br>
                The only conclusion to draw is that discussion of a Citizen's 
                Income is central to any future discussion of social security 
                reform.</p>

              <p><b>The Zacchaeus 2000 Trust comments on how the government's 
                New Deal scheme is working:</b><br>
                The Zacchaeus 2000 Trust has recently funded work at the Family 
                Budget Unit to determine how much people need to live on, and 
                has publicised the results of the research. It has also made submissions 
                to government on a variety of government initiatives on the basis 
                of its own research, and a recent submission on how the government's 
                New Deal for young people is working might be of interest to readers 
                of this newsletter:<br>
                The Trust writes:<br>
                &quot;We suggest the committee investigates the following areas 
                of concern during its new enquiry. <br>
                A poverty trap is created by Working Families Tax Credits. The 
                tapers cut out the council tax and housing benefits too soon. 
                The transfer of the full payment of rent and council tax to the 
                low paid employee can result in greater poverty in employment 
                than out of it. So debts arise. <br>
                People who experience short periods of employment on low incomes 
                and then return to unemployment on benefits can find themselves 
                in debt because their pay was too low while they were employed 
                to feed themselves and their children and, at the same time, pay 
                the Council Tax and Rent. Low paid contract workers are particularly 
                vulnerable. <br>
                A further problem for the low paid is the Local Authorities method 
                of calculating &quot;eligible rent&quot; which can be less than 
                the actual rent. Housing benefit is paid to cover the eligible 
                rent leaving the tenant to pay the balance of the actual rent 
                out of the already inadequate statutory minimum incomes either 
                in or out of work. <br>
                Another trap is the debt caused by the delay and inefficiency 
                in processing benefit applications in local authorities, benefit 
                agencies and job centres, or their privatised equivalents. Getting 
                off benefits and getting back on puts people in debt and on the 
                streets because of delays and mistakes. This is caused by shortage 
                of staff and lack of training.<br>
                Claimants fall into debt when going into employment because the 
                payment of benefits is not cancelled and they are then charged 
                by the local authority for the over payment, and when going back 
                on to benefits into unemployment because delays and mistakes mean 
                that the rent is not paid. This leads to threats of eviction and 
                homelessness. The same is true of council tax leading to threats 
                of distress and prison. <br>
                The benefit system collapses altogether when a young person falls 
                out with the &quot;New deal for young people&quot; and income 
                support is cancelled. This forces them into the informal economy 
                or homelessness when their skills do not match the jobs on offer 
                in the formal economy. Seven million adults can barely read or 
                write. Carrying drugs from A to B pays &pound;50 a time. This 
                cancellation of benefits should be repealed. <br>
                We hope the committee will investigate whether this cancellation 
                of benefit contravenes the International Convention on Economic, 
                Social and Cultural Rights. <br>
                The number of unemployed is counted by the number receiving benefits. 
                There is, therefore, political pressure to get people off benefits. 
                This pressure may be influencing the decisions of staff in a manner 
                which deprives people of benefits to which they are fully entitled. 
                <br>
                I hope the committee will investigate the destinations of the 
                29% of young people leaving the New Deal to unknown destinations.&quot;</p>
              <p><b>The Centre for Asset-based Welfare</b><br>
                The Institute for Public Policy Research has launched a 'Centre 
                for Asset-based Welfare' to study the role of assets (such as 
                savings and investments) in welfare policy. Asset-based policies 
                could become a significant part of the welfare state. Already 
                the government has proposed a Child Trust Fund, and the new Centre 
                plans to undertake research which will give a better understanding 
                of why holding assets might create beneficial social and economic 
                outcomes for individuals. <br>
                In an article in Prospect (December 2001, page 50), Gavin Kelly 
                (Research Director of the IPPR) and Julian Le Grand (Professor 
                of Social Policy at the London School of Economics) discuss the 
                way in which asset accumulation is currently subsidised for the 
                already wealthy (in the form of tax relief on pension contributions) 
                and the way in which the asset-based welfare suggested by Thomas 
                Paine has historically been submerged beneath a welfare system 
                based on the reallocation of income rather than of capital. The 
                authors tackle the 'futility' objection to such plans as the Child 
                Trust Fund (the argument that small amounts are pointless) by 
                suggesting that once an idea is established then public opinion 
                can determine the level of the payments, and by drawing on research 
                which shows that even small savings can increase people's wellbeing.<br>
                In addition to the Child Trust Fund, the government is also planning 
                a 'savings gateway', whereby every &pound;1 saved by an individual 
                (up to an annual limit) will be matched by &pound;1 from the government. 
                <br>
                The Citizen's Income Trust will watch these new government initiatives 
                with interest, and will study carefully any research which the 
                new centre publishes. The universal nature of the Child Trust 
                Fund and the savings gateway, and the simplicity of their administration, 
                will make their behaviour similar to that of a Citizen's Income, 
                and how these initiatives are received will be useful information 
                for anyone interested in the extension of universal benefits. 
                And because universal benefits make people more likely to save 
                (because means-tested benefits are a disincentive to saving), 
                we hope at some point to see the government suggesting a small 
                Citizen's Income to match these current experiments in universal 
                provision.<br>

              <p><b><font size="4">A contribution to debate </font></b></p>
              <p><b>The reform of Housing Benefit</b></p>
              <p>Housing Benefit is an essential component of many people's income, 
                enabling them to afford somewhere to live; but it is also a major 
                contributor to the poverty trap. Housing Benefit is means-tested, 
                with a 65% withdrawal rate as earned income rises, meaning that 
                someone who leaves means-tested benefits for paid employment, 
                or who increases their earned income, can suffer high marginal 
                tax rates. There is a small disregard, meaning that it is worth 
                someone being employed for a couple of hours a week, but not for 
                longer. And because short-term employment means the loss of Housing 
                Benefit, a new application, and then another application when 
                the job ends, short-term employment is avoided because claimants 
                cannot predict the effect on their Housing Benefit and they fear 
                administrative mistakes and the consequent rent arrears. <br>
                Ideally, housing costs should be low enough to enable Housing 
                Benefit to be dispensed with, and the government's recent Green 
                Paper on housing and the subsequent statement of policy regard 
                the reform of social housing and the implementation of additional 
                means of providing affordable housing as important ways of enabling 
                people to afford decent housing. But the government recognises 
                that this will be a long-term strategy, and therefore makes proposals 
                for the reform of Housing Benefit in the short term, the key methods 
                being to raise standards in administration, to simplify the four 
                existing transitional protection schemes (left over from previous 
                attempts at reform), and to 'promote work incentives'. The policy 
                statement records that amongst those who commented on the Green 
                Paper &quot;there was widespread support for taking action to 
                improve work incentives &#133;&#133;. [and] there was general 
                support for longer-term, more structural reform, but varying views 
                about when it should take place, and in what form.&quot; <br>
                The policy statement recognises that &quot;much of the work disincentive 
                effect lies in the administrative problems, rather than the design 
                of the scheme itself,&quot; and that &quot;Housing Benefit is 
                complicated. This makes it difficult for local authorities to 
                administer and difficult for the public to understand. That, in 
                turn, make it more vulnerable to fraud and error and damages work 
                incentives.&quot; This leads the government to the conclusion 
                that what is required is &quot;a more effective process for making 
                claims, along with changes to ease the transition into work and 
                improve the administrative fit between Housing Benefit and tax 
                credits.&quot; The document proposes the removal of the need to 
                make a new claim on starting work, and the speeding up of Housing 
                Benefit payment if a job ends after a short period. The Department 
                has decided not to reform disregards, tapers and non-dependent 
                deductions at this stage because, &quot;given the current problems, 
                sorting out the administration, combined with our 'benefit run-ons', 
                will have more impact on work incentives than changing additional 
                rules in these areas.&quot; <br>
                A proposal in the Green Paper, and one which has been greeted 
                with interest by respondents (including the charity Shelter), 
                is the idea of a flat-rate element. A Housing Benefit made up 
                of a percentage of a locally-agreed flat rate (based on average 
                local housing costs) and a percentage of a claimant's actual housing 
                costs would offer some incentive to claimants to seek cheaper 
                accommodation if they were able to do so. Clearly, a scheme with 
                a flat-rate element would encourage people to move to cheaper 
                accommodation if they could, as doing this would increase their 
                disposable income. A less steep taper, increased disregards, and 
                longer claim periods, would enhance work incentives. The Way Forward 
                for Housing mentions each of these possible reforms, but does 
                not combine them. If all four approaches were to be taken together, 
                then the poverty trap effect of Housing Benefit would be much 
                reduced, as people would have a greater ability to increase their 
                disposable income through moving home and/or seeking employment 
                or increased earned income.<br>
                The logic of this argument leads to the conclusion that to set 
                Housing Benefit at a locally-agreed flat rate, to remove the taper 
                completely, to increase the disregard to the total of someone's 
                earned income, and to increase to a lifetime the period for which 
                the benefit is paid, would remove completely all disincentive 
                effects currently related to Housing Benefit. Given that everyone 
                needs to be housed, to pay such a benefit to every individual 
                (with children's benefits being paid to adults caring for them) 
                would avoid the current necessity to work out who is living in 
                which household. And the fact that this benefit would be going 
                to individuals who are not currently in receipt of Housing Benefit 
                is no argument against this approach, as all that is required 
                to recoup the money is to lower tax allowances and raise tax rates 
                slightly. <br>
                Such a simplified system would leave little room for fraud or 
                error (both identified as serious problems in the Green Paper), 
                and it would give people greater confidence to go out looking 
                for work, as they would know that their benefit would not be affected.<br>
                A major problem in London is that low-paid essential workers can 
                no longer afford to rent or purchase accommodation. To pay a Housing 
                Benefit as outlined above would mean that, whatever someone's 
                earned income, they would receive a higher benefit in areas of 
                high housing costs and a lower benefit in areas of lower housing 
                costs. Thus a simplification of Housing Benefit along these lines, 
                which would extend the benefit in a non-withdrawable fashion to 
                low-earners, would contribute towards the solution of an additional 
                and serious problem.<br>
                Radical proposals are rarely implemented in the benefits field 
                (Family Allowances, which became Child Benefit, are an important 
                exception), but if the logic of an argument leads to desirable 
                outcomes, then there is surely an obligation at least to consider 
                the possibility of a radical solution, particularly where that 
                solution might tackle problems in addition to the ones which it 
                was originally designed to tackle.<br>
                Shelter suggests the following criteria by which any housing scheme 
                should be judged: Housing Benefit should<br>
                &middot; Promote social inclusion<br>
                &middot; Be paid to people who cannot pay for their own accommodation<br>
                &middot; Cover reasonable rents<br>
                &middot; Make work pay<br>
                &middot; Be transparent and accountable. <br>
                The scheme proposed in this paper fulfils every one of these criteria.</p>
              <p>I would like to thank Daniel Brewer of the Pivot Initiative,

                <b>The Citizen's Income Trust and its future</b><br>
                Following the ending of the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust's 
                generous funding a year ago, the Citizen's Income Trust has successfully 
                negotiated the change from being a well-funded organisation with 
                an office and paid staff to being a low-budget organisation run 
                by voluntary labour. The organisation's activities have been refocused 
                on our primary objective: the promotion of debate about the feasibility 
                and effects of Citizen's Income schemes. The newsletter has been 
                issued more regularly than before, the website has been maintained, 
                and after running in this fashion for the next couple of years 
                we hope to be in a good position to seek funding for the longer-term 
                projects which we are planning. <br>
                Running costs<br>
                The one problem which the trustees face is that the Trust ended 
                2001 with no money in the bank. We do not currently have to pay 
                for an office or for paid staff, but website and email hosting, 
                insurance, audit fee, telephones, stationery and postage cost 
                about &pound;1,500 p.a., and the newsletter costs about &pound;3,000 
                p.a.. Subscription income from institutions amounts to only about 
                &pound;1,500. The Trust therefore requires donations of about 
                &pound;3,000 p.a. to perform the basic functions for which it 
                exists.<br>
                A serious problem is that the promotion of debate on the reform 
                of tax and benefits does not now fit the grant-making criteria 
                of any charitable trusts. Whilst we hope that in the future particular 
                projects might attract such funding, it is difficult to see how 
                any grant-awarding trusts might be persuaded to fund the Trust's 
                core running costs. We are therefore entirely dependent upon individual 
                donations.<br>
                The next five years<br>
                In order to plan for the next five years and to be able to seek 
                funding for projects such as seminar series, conferences, new 
                publications, research projects (particularly on costings) and 
                a commission on the reform of tax and benefits, the trustees need 
                to be sure that donation income of &pound;3,000 p.a. will be available 
                for the next five years.<br>
                Can you help ?<br>
                Many of this newsletter's readers have already been generous with 
                donations for the current year. Whether or not you have already 
                made donations to the Trust, would you be willing to promise a 
                fixed annual or monthly sum for a period of five years ? And if 
                you know of any individual, company, or other organisation interested 
                in the reform of tax and benefits, would you be willing to show 
                them this appeal and ask for their help ? <br>
                The trustees of the Citizen's Income Trust have decided, reluctantly, 
                that if by the middle of June the Trust has not received promises 
                of &pound;3,000 p.a. then the charity will not be viable in the 
                medium term and that closure will be inevitable. We wish to avoid 
                this if at all possible. The Citizen's Income Trust is the only 
                charitable trust with the sole aim of promoting debate on the 
                reform of tax and benefits - which is why we are asking for your 
                help.<br>
                If you might be able to help the Trust and would like to discuss 
                making a regular donation, whether large or small, annually or 
                monthly, to the Trust, then please get in touch with the Director, 
                Dr. Malcolm Torry. Contact details are on the front of the newsletter. 
                He would also like to hear from you if you would like to pay for 
                one of the short-term or long-term projects we are planning, such 
                as a new introductory leaflet (&pound;1,500), a seminar series 
                (&pound;3,000), an annual lecture (&pound;1,000), research on 
                the costings of alternatives (&pound;5,000+) and a commission 
                on the reform of tax and benefits (&pound;160,000).<br>
                With many thanks for your continuing interest in a debate essential 
                to the health of our society and economy,<br>
                Anne Miller, Chair of the trustees<br>
