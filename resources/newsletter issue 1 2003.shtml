                      Crusoe were alone, he would obviously die at the beginning

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Daniel 
                      Defoe's Robinson Crusoe is of course the world's most famous 
                      ship-wreck victim. The reason for this dire prognosis for 
                      his old age is that Samuelson assumed it was not possible 
                      to preserve consumption goods, to save them for future consumption 
                      - consumption goods cannot be transported through time because 
                      they are perishable. This assumption is still generally 
                      valid. Samuelson's 1958 paper provoked a concurring reply 
                      from his fellow economist Abba Lerner, in which Lerner stated:<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;...the 
                      fable of the time-travel of consumption is accepted with 
                      implicit faith by the accountants, as guardians of the private 
                      point of view of savers who are putting money aside for 
                      their old age. It is the duty of economists, as guardians 
                      of the social point of view, to explode this fairy tale.&quot; 
                      (Abba Lerner, 1959, p.517).<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      task of this paper is to explode the myth that somehow the 
                      'burden' of an ageing population is heavier if the attempt 
                      is made to support it by a pay-as-you-go pension scheme, 
                      and that this ageing will inevitably render such PAYG schemes 
                      unsustainable and condemn any such attempt to failure.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Why 
                      is it important to dispel this myth? Well, let us be clear 
                      at the outset. A citizen's pension (CP) - a flat rate pension 
                      payable to all citizens unconditionally - would, de facto, 
                      be financed on a PAYG basis. In the present climate, that 
                      is almost certain to be seen as an obstacle to its adoption. 
                      <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      its green paper Partnership in Pensions, the UK government 
                      has stressed that &quot;Those who can save for retirement 
                      have a responsibility to do so&quot; (DSS, 1998, chapter 
                      9). There is no mention in the document of the responsibility 
                      on which a citizen's pension would be based; that is the 
                      responsibility of those who can afford it to bear an appropriate 
                      share of the tax burden required to finance a decent level 
                      of pension income for all pensioners. The green paper explicitly 
                      states that it is an objective of the government to reduce 
                      the proportion of the pensioner population's income that 
                      is provided via the state, and increase the proportion provided 
                      through the private sector. The basic state pension is to 
                      continue to be indexed only to prices rather than average 
                      earnings. SERPS is to be replaced by a flat rate State Second 
                      Pension and still more people will be encouraged to opt 
                      out of this and take up a private pre-funded pension instead. 
                      A new pension product is to be introduced to achieve this 
                      - the Stakeholder Pension. Additionally, and quite inexplicably, 
                      the green paper offers the claim that &quot;state pensions 
                      cannot be supplemented with voluntary provision&quot; as 
                      a justification for reducing the role of state pensions. 
                      In fact, people in the UK have been using private pensions 
                      to supplement their state pension entitlement for decades. 
                      The bias against PAYG would appear to be clear and the government 
                      seems to subscribe to the same fable as Lerner believed 
                      accountants did.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">If 
                      a citizen's pension is to be taken seriously as a policy 
                      option, PAYG must be rehabilitated. The present paper seeks 
                      to address the myth of the burden of PAYG pensions but also 
                      seeks to widen the debate. For once it is accepted that 
                      the 'burden' of an elderly population of given size is the 
                      same, whether that population's income is provided on a 
                      PAYG or pre-funded basis, then there are other issues which 
                      may lead us to prefer one financing method over the other. 
                      Thus, the argument that PAYG financing is not the pariah 
                      it is sometimes made to seem is developed along three dimensions:<br>

                      section A Samuelson's Robinson Crusoe example is adapted 
                      to dispel the instinctive mistrust of the PAYG concept. 
                      It is pointed out that the current method of raising the 
                      funds for the UK's state PAYG pension system is inefficient 
                      but that this should not be taken as an argument for scrapping 
                      the PAYG scheme. There are superior potential alternative 
                      taxes which should be used to finance state pensions. Additionally, 
                      the widely held view that PAYG pensions depress the level 
                      of private savings in the economy with detrimental effects 
                      on economic performance is based on a rather one-sided view 
                      of the economic arguments. There are persuasive counter-arguments 
                      and there is no strong empirical evidence to support claims 
                      that PAYG is damaging to the health of an economy.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      section B it is argued that PAYG has the advantage over 
                      private pre-funded pensions in dealing with certain risks, 
                      including inflation risk and risks such as unemployment. 
                      Fear of the frequently cited threat to PAYG schemes, political 
                      risk, is discussed and shown to be based on a self-fulfilling 
                      circular argument.<br>
                      Section C considers two equity issues. First, it is taken 
                      as fact that some redistribution towards the less well off 
                      in retirement is desired. In this case a PAYG system is 
                      not only desirable but essential. Secondly, it is argued 
                      that the issue of what is termed inter-generational equity, 
                      which has been presented as a threat to PAYG systems, is 
                      of little practical relevance.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Much 
                      popular debate about pensions appears to start from the 
                      position that pay-as-you-go financing of pensions is at 
                      best unsustainable and at worst fraudulent. An ageing population 
                      will render PAYG schemes insolvent (whatever that might 
                      mean) and to reinforce the point, attention is focused on 
                      alleged damaging macroeconomic effects. In the UK, as elsewhere, 
                      state PAYG pension payments constitute a part of public 
                      expenditure, and since the 1970s concern about the macroeconomic 
                      impact of public spending has turned into virtual hostility. 
                      The tide may be turning, with the election of a Labour government 
                      in 1997, but concern about public expenditure, and especially 
                      welfare spending, remains strong, as evidenced by the Chancellor's 
                      initial commitment to the previous administration's spending 
                      plans. In any event, for those waverers who might like the 
                      idea of a state pension, there is always the fear of spiralling 
                      taxes and the consequent cost to themselves. The overall 
                      result is that in TV documentaries we observe doleful members 
                      of the public opining along the lines of: &quot;well, I'd 
                      like to rely on the state, but I just don't feel I can any 
                      more.&quot; (For example, see the Panorama documentary 'From 
                      the Cradle to the Grave,' 1998.)<br>

                      sophisticated debate bemoans the level of payroll taxes 
                      that will be required to finance PAYG pensions for a future 
                      larger retired population, and the effect of the private 
                      saving displaced by a PAYG scheme. The concern though is 
                      the same: the impact on inflation, unemployment and growth, 
                      the three key data items on which most popular judgements 
                      about the performance of the macroeconomy are based.<br>

                      discussing the more sophisticated arguments, let us revisit 
                      a much earlier debate so that the popular 'bar-room' argument 
                      against PAYG can be put aside.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      instinctive scepticism about PAYG schemes is not new and 
                      nor is it a peculiarly British phenomenon. Abba Lerner, 
                      a prominent American economist, writing in 1959, noted that 
                      there was a &quot;belief that a social security program 
                      cannot operate honestly unless it has acquired a fund actuarially 
                      corresponding to the savings of all those members who have 
                      paid in their contributions in the past and who will be 
                      taking them out as benefits in the future.&quot; He went 
                      on to say emphatically:<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;...the 
                      fact is that such a fund is completely unnecessary. It is 
                      called for only because accountants look on the social security 
                      program as old age insurance provided by an enterprise that 
                      must accumulate assets to match its contingent liabilities. 
                      Such accounting practices are completely justified for a 
                      private insurance company, which must be prepared for the 
                      eventuality of failing to enrol any new customers and still 
                      having to pay the covenanted benefits to its old customers. 
                      But from the social point of view, the pensions of the old 
                      can only come out of the current output of consumption goods. 
                      The pensions may therefore be paid out of current contributions, 
                      and the only fund necessary is a reserve to cover expected 
                      temporary excesses of outlays in pensions over collections 
                      in contributions.&quot; (Lerner, 1959, p.516, emphasis added.)

                      Lerner's memorable point about the role of economists, quoted 
                      at the head of this paper. And nothing has changed. The 
                      time-travel of consumption remains a fable, despite technological 
                      developments, such as irradiation, allowing the longer storage 
                      of foodstuffs. Economists remain concerned with the stewardship 
                      of society's productive resources and the distribution of 
                      its output. So the OECD was able to publish a report in 
                      1992 in which it was restated that:<br>
                      &quot;Only reducing the consumption of the aged... reduces 
                      their cost to society. The means of financing, advance funding 
                      or pay-as-you-go, does not change these costs&quot; (Duskin, 
                      1992).<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Since 
                      time-travel of consumption goods is impossible, if Crusoe 
                      is not to starve in his retirement, he must find someone 
                      else (either younger or willing to retire later in life) 
                      to produce the things he needs to stay alive. The assumption 
                      then is that some deal must be struck. Crusoe must offer 
                      the younger islander something in return for his sustenance 
                      in retirement. What can Crusoe offer? He can only offer 
                      some of his own output while working. His younger compatriot 
                      will thus enjoy a more extravagant lifestyle during the 
                      earlier part of his life but will then have to support Crusoe 
                      and simultaneously seek urgently to find, and strike a similar 
                      deal with, a third younger individual. If the need to strike 
                      such deals could be avoided, by somehow binding in the unborn 
                      generation to a PAYG system, then Crusoe and his successors 
                      would all be better off, since none would have to pay the 
                      succeeding generation in advance of receiving support in 
                      old age. This is the essential insight of Samuelson's 1958 
                      paper and is what John Hills of the London School of Economics 
                      has likened to passing boxes of chocolates along a line 
                      of people (Hills, 1992).<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">If 
                      everyone in the line passes their box of chocolates to the 
                      person on the left, then the person on the extreme left 
                      ends up with two boxes and the person on the right ends 
                      up with none - unless every person born joins the end of 
                      the line at the right with their box of chocolates. In the 
                      Crusoe case, it would be Crusoe who ended with two boxes 
                      of chocolates. Hills suggested that in the UK it was the 
                      generation who had to fight the second world war who benefited 
                      in this way from the establishment of the UK's 1948 welfare 
                      state, and so it could be argued that they were deserving 
                      of this good fortune. Once the 'game' is in progress, then 
                      no one loses out unless someone refuses to join the line 
                      and hand over their box of chocolates. As long as the 'social 
                      compact', to use Samuelson's phrase, is adhered to, all 
                      is well. In fact all is better than well, because Samuelson 
                      showed that all are better off than they would be in the 
                      non-cooperative situation wherein we rely on market transactions 
                      - having to make deals.<br>

                      was seeking to characterise a welfare system in its entirety 
                      and was not exclusively concerned with pensions. In fact, 
                      the analogy would be a more accurate representation of a 
                      PAYG pension scheme if we imagined that the individuals 
                      in the line pass on not the whole box of chocolates to the 
                      person on their immediate left, but rather that they pass 
                      a percentage of the chocolates their boxes contain to individuals 
                      placed beyond a certain point along the line to the left. 
                      This is a point that becomes important in the later argument 
                      in section B.<br>

                      discussion of Crusoe hints that our analysis so far is based 
                      on a rather simple economy. It has been presented, not to 
                      justify PAYG pensions in all circumstances, but to illustrate 
                      that there is nothing inherently wrong with financing pensions 
                      on a PAYG basis - to try to overcome the instinctive objection 
                      that some people seem to have to PAYG. If we have succeeded 
                      in this, then we can now proceed to consider the more subtle 
                      arguments. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Samuelson's 
                      seminal overlapping generations model allowed for no investment 
                      goods. There was no capital equipment! As soon as this assumption 
                      is relaxed, it becomes possible to see that another alternative 
                      is open to Crusoe. Upon retirement, he could have offered 
                      his successor worker his capital equipment, his fishing 
                      rods etc, in return for payment in terms of consumables 
                      during his retirement. However, Crusoe would have had to 
                      forego consumption during his working life in order to devote 
                      time and effort to the production of those capital goods. 
                      This is no different to foregoing consumption in order to 
                      pay his younger comrade in fish etc, as in the earlier case. 
                      An important difference emerges, though, if the capital 
                      equipment Crusoe produced enhances his and his successor's 
                      productivity, as would be expected. This is where much serious 
                      debate about PAYG scheme focuses: does PAYG funding 'crowd 
                      out' productive investment? For if Crusoe could establish 
                      a 'chocolate box line', &agrave; la Hills, then he need 
                      not make the investment in capital goods that will become 
                      his meal ticket in retirement. We take up this issue below.<br>

                      the primitive island economy inhabited by Crusoe, there 
                      was no consideration needed either of the effect of the 
                      taxes required to effect a transfer of spending power between 
                      two groups. The island was a barter economy. Taxes alter 
                      the pattern of relative prices in an economy. For instance, 
                      and most pertinently, income taxes raise the price of labour 
                      to employers and reduce the price of leisure (not working) 
                      for workers. Income taxes may therefore be expected to reduce 
                      the amount of work done . <br>

                      is worth pausing for a moment to clarify our terminology 
                      here. Earlier, in the quote from Duskin (1992), there was 
                      a reference to the cost of the aged to society. Duskin is 
                      talking about the cost in terms of the size of the total 
                      sum expended in pensions paid to the aged. Although that 
                      is a cost to the working population, since there is an opportunity 
                      cost associated with handing over their money (they cannot 
                      spend it on other things), it is not a cost in the usual 
                      accounting sense of using up some resources in order to 
                      produce some desired output. In this case, the desired output 
                      is the accomplishment of a transfer of spending power from 
                      one group to another. The cost of such 'output' comprises 
                      the labour and other resources required to achieve this. 
                      Moreover, it is not hard to see why a PAYG state scheme 
                      might compare rather favourably with pre-funded private 
                      pensions in terms of this cost. There are economies of scale 
                      in administering pension schemes, and there are no costs 
                      involved in persuading citizens to sign up to become beneficiaries 
                      of a state scheme . Private schemes are smaller and incur 
                      large marketing costs. (It is acknowledged that in any such 
                      comparison, the costs borne by employers in complying with 
                      the requirements of a state scheme should not be overlooked.)<br>

                      costs with which we are now concerned are different again. 
                      These are what economists would more formally call 'deadweight 
                      losses'. Such losses constitute desirable output that would 
                      have been produced in the absence of the transfer of resources 
                      (in this case from workers to the retired) but which is 
                      not now produced and for which no other output is produced 
                      to compensate. Productive investment is not undertaken because 
                      of crowding out, and labour is not applied to produce useful 
                      output because of taxes on labour; and nothing else is done 
                      with those resources that now lie idle.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">These 
                      deadweight losses are what Arthur Okun had in mind when 
                      he talked of a 'leaky bucket' being used to carry resources 
                      from the better off to the less well-off. The theoretical 
                      possibility of such leaks is well established but their 
                      empirical reality and magnitude are not. Yet the question 
                      we need to answer is: how large a loss due to the leaky 
                      bucket should be tolerated before the attempt at redistribution 
                      should be abandoned? There is a cost-benefit analysis to 
                      be carried out here, which this paper does not attempt. 
                      However, further comment can be offered.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Certainly 
                      the attempt should not be abandoned or limited unless every 
                      precaution has been taken to ensure that the leak is minimised. 
                      If the case for a citizen's pension as a benefit is accepted, 
                      then the optimal means of financing should be sought. The 
                      current means of financing the UK's PAYG state pension payments, 
                      through 'contributions' from employers and employees which 
                      amount to a tax on employment and a tax on income from work, 
                      cannot be argued to be optimal in this sense. James Meade, 
                      Nobel Laureate in economics, has described it as the &quot;height 
                      of folly&quot; (Meade, 1995, p.52). In the twenty-first 
                      century, it may well be felt that an appropriate way of 
                      financing a citizen's pension would be, at least in part, 
                      through 'eco-taxes', e.g. taxes on CO2 emissions, and this 
                      is a proposal now receiving some attention in academic circles. 
                      Whereas the contributory principle is not only used to exclude 
                      some people from benefit, but also constitutes a tax on 
                      work, taxing pollution creates a disincentive to something 
                      that most people believe should be discouraged anyway.<br>

                      a relatively simple solution such as this appears to be 
                      possible, it is perhaps not necessary to measure the 'leak' 
                      arising from the current folly all that accurately. We should, 
                      as a matter of urgency, move towards a better tax base. 
                      There is no such simple solution to the problem of crowding 
                      out and so it is important to assess as accurately as possible 
                      the extent of this phenomenon. Unfortunately that is not 
                      easy to do. There are a number of reasons why it is difficult 
                      to establish unambiguous theoretical predictions of the 
                      effect of PAYG pensions on saving and investment.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">One 
                      of the justifications that has long been offered for state 
                      pension provision is myopia. Individuals are short-sighted 
                      and, left to their own devices, will make too little provision 
                      for their retirement. If that is true then it cannot be 
                      argued that the state scheme is crowding out private saving. 
                      The fact that many politicians and others involved in the 
                      policy debate over pensions in the UK and elsewhere advocate, 
                      or have introduced, compulsory purchase of private pension 
                      products for their workers suggests that there is a widespread 
                      acceptance of the notion of myopia.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It 
                      might still be argued that the economy would benefit from 
                      greater investment and so some policy to increase saving 
                      is warranted. However, this really has nothing to do with 
                      PAYG pensions; the policy need not take the form of additional 
                      pension-specific saving; and, in any event, in a world of 
                      mobile capital there would appear to be little reason to 
                      suppose that investment is constrained by low domestic saving. 
                      Too little investment is likely to reflect lack of demand 
                      for investment funds, rather than shortage of supply. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">A 
                      further complication arises from the acknowledgement that 
                      ending state pension provision without retaining some vestige 
                      of state assistance for the poor elderly is not a plausible 
                      option. The UK government remains committed to state involvement 
                      in pension provision. Whilst some means-tested assistance 
                      is made available, some people will inevitably face the 
                      prospect that additional private saving will simply disqualify 
                      them from receipt of state assistance. Thus a savings trap 
                      will induce some to save less, a concern which recurs in 
                      Pensions in Partnership. Unfortunately, while the government 
                      has emphasised the problem, it has only been able to claim 
                      that the problem will be reduced and voluntary savings penalised 
                      less as a result of its planned pensions reforms (DSS, 1998, 
                      chapter 9). Furthermore, any proposal involving the payment 
                      of compulsory pension contributions by the state on behalf 
                      of individuals unable to pay for themselves would similarly 
                      create poverty traps - if such individuals were able to 
                      find an opportunity to increase their income legitimately, 
                      they might not find it worth while to take up the opportunity 
                      because they would disqualify themselves from state assistance 
                      with their pension contributions. This was a basic flaw 
                      in Frank Field's proposals as set out in Field (1995) and 
                      would appear to afflict the green paper proposals also .<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">So 
                      there is no convincing theoretical argument that crowding 
                      out will be significant and the issue becomes an empirical 
                      one. Empirical studies attempting to test the hypothesis 
                      that state PAYG pensions have a deleterious effect on economic 
                      performance are frustrated by the fact that it is difficult 
                      to isolate their impact from the effect of other state transfers 
                      (to the unemployed, for example). Therefore, many studies 
                      instead address the issue of the effect of state welfare 
                      in the aggregate on economic performance, measured at a 
                      high level of aggregation, e.g., growth of GDP per head. 
                      Atkinson (1995) assessed nine studies all broadly concerned 
                      with this issue, though differing in detail, and found that 
                      in two of these no significant impact was detected, in four 
                      a negative effect was reported, and in three studies evidence 
                      was found of a positive influence of welfare spending on 
                      economic performance. A further recent study adopted a fairly 
                      simple econometric method to investigate the same question 
                      and found evidence of a weak negative link between state 
                      pension spending and growth of GDP per capita for the 1970s 
                      and 1980s, but not for the 1960s (Caritte &amp; Williamson, 
                      1995).<br>

                      criticised the empirical research he reviewed on the ground 
                      that it takes insufficient account of the &quot;fine structure&quot; 
                      of the welfare system. Many state benefits have complex 
                      rules governing their disbursement, and these rules influence 
                      the incentives and disincentives created by the benefits. 
                      For example, the operation of means-tested support for the 
                      elderly just mentioned might or might not take into account 
                      housing wealth. Econometric analyses that do not allow for 
                      such complication can only ever pronounce on whether welfare 
                      should be curtailed or scrapped. They cannot provide us

                      to sluggish economic growth and decreasing productivity;

                      from PAYG financing to advance funding would yield additional 
                      benefits that cannot be attained by adopting a more sensible

                      is worth pursuing the economics of ageing and pensions a 
                      little further. Much attention tends to be focused on the 
                      so-called dependency ratio effect of ageing whereby &quot;total 
                      output per worker has to be shared with a larger number 
                      of pensioners, leading to lower PAYG benefits [per pensioner]&quot; 
                      (Meijdam &amp; Verbon, 1997). Yet there is also a second 
                      and off-setting effect whereby, when the population is ageing, 
                      less saving is necessary to maintain the capital-labour 
                      ratio, and so the share of consumption in GDP can actually 
                      be increased; and some of this additional consumption can 
                      be allocated to the retired population through higher pension 
                      benefits per pensioner. Partly for this reason Cutler et 
                      al concluded in 1990 that the optimal policy response to 
                      population ageing in the US was &quot;almost certainly a 
                      reduction rather than an increase in the national saving 
                      rate.&quot; While this may not hold for other countries, 
                      or even for the US at a different time in different circumstances, 
                      the finding is a clear demonstration that economic analysis 
                      does not lend unequivocal support to the popular idea that 
                      ageing requires more saving. <br>

                      population ageing itself may be expected to have economic 
                      consequences, independently of any feedback via the pension 
                      system. Cutler et al make another interesting observation: 
                      &quot;any effects of demography on technical change are 
                      likely to dwarf its other consequences&quot; (Cutler et 
                      al, 1990, p.55). Although Robert Solow (1957) found that 
                      technical progress was far more significant a contributor 
                      to economic growth than mere capital accumulation (the raising 
                      of the capital labour ratio, making labour more productive), 
                      much economic analysis continues to treat technology as 
                      a 'black box'. The consequences for the rate of technological 
                      progress of an ageing workforce are thus open to much speculation, 
                      even though many economists would agree with Cutler et al 
                      that the consequences will be highly important. It is important 
                      to keep the debate over pensions funding in perspective.<br>

                      or caring, which interrupt work and reduce lifetime earnings. 
                      This prevents the individual accumulating the amount of 
                      pension entitlement they would have wanted prior to their 
                      retirement, and can affect both private pension arrangements 
                      and state pensions (if these are contributions-based).<br>

                      is much discussion of whether private insurance can successfully 
                      deal with these risks. Annuities insure against living 'too 
                      long' (longevity risk) and permanent health insurance is 
                      available to cover the risk of loss of income due to incapacity. 
                      However, private provision for unemployment risk is not 
                      well-developed and is arguably problematical. Caring responsibilities 
                      which remove people from the labour force altogether present 
                      a very different challenge. A useful overview is provided 
                      by the Association of British Insurers (1995). Burchardt 
                      and Hills (1997) focus on three case studies (which include 
                      the risk of loss of income due to unemployment and illness, 
                      but not pensions themselves) and demonstrate that for these, 
                      social security appears to offer a better solution than 
                      private insurance.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      purpose of pensions is to allow people to carry forward 
                      consumption possibilities, even though the time travel of 
                      physical consumption goods is, by and large, impossible. 
                      Their purpose is to solve Crusoe's problem as described 
                      at the beginning of this paper. In the Samuelson-Lerner 
                      exchange, both were concerned to ensure that people are 
                      able to satisfy their preferences for consumption at different 
                      points in time. Samuelson (1958) points out that a form 
                      of social compact is needed to achieve this and that the 
                      use of money is just such a social compact. All agree to 
                      accept money in payment for goods. This means that another 
                      risk becomes of considerable importance - inflation.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      1998 the view of the National Pensioners Convention was 
                      that &quot;Any pension scheme worthy of the name should 
                      provide pensions of broadly predictable value&quot; (NPC, 
                      1998, p.12), and there is no reason to believe that its 
                      view has changed since then. What matters of course is the 
                      real value of the pension, and inflation makes the future 
                      real value of a pension uncertain. Only if the level of 
                      real returns on investments is independent of the rate of 
                      inflation can inflation be ignored. Whilst some assets are 
                      better hedges against inflation than others, there are times 
                      when people saving for retirement will wish to hold a substantial 
                      portion of their pension savings in cash, e.g. as they approach 
                      retirement. They are then vulnerable to inflation. Once 
                      retired, exposure to this risk is arguably even greater. 
                      Few private pension schemes offer full inflation-proofing 
                      of the annuity in payment once an individual has retired. 
                      Workers in the UK who retired in the early 1970s soon saw 
                      the purchasing power of their private pensions eroded by 
                      the inflation that followed in the rest of that decade.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      relation to this risk, a PAYG pension scheme has a clear 
                      advantage over money as a social compact. PAYG pensions 
                      can be indexed in line with inflation (or any other chosen 
                      measure, such as average earnings) and as long as the tax 
                      system is such that revenue in cash terms rises in line 
                      with inflation, this presents no economic difficulty . Thus 
                      PAYG pensions can be viewed as a means of dealing with a 
                      flaw inherent in money - its inability to perform reliably 
                      its function as a store of value. <br>
                      In this connection Samuelson noted that &quot;Even after 
                      extreme inflations, social security programmes can re-create 
                      themselves anew astride the community's indestructible real 
                      tax base.&quot; (Samuelson, 1958, p.482) Whilst the notion 
                      of an indestructible tax base is meaningful - the tax base 
                      is in a sense the total formally marketed output produced 
                      by an economy - we should acknowledge that this tax base 
                      must be treated with consideration. The reader is reminded 
                      of the earlier argument about incentives and the fact that 
                      taxes can lead to reduced output. The difficulties encountered 
                      a few years ago by the Russian government in collecting 
                      sufficient taxes to cover its expenditure is also a salient 
                      example, but serves really to reinforce the point made earlier 
                      that the current system of financing state pensions in the 
                      UK by a payroll tax is folly indeed.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">What 
                      this amounts to is that PAYG allows society to choose how 
                      it wishes to allocate real consumption among workers and 
                      pensioners, without the flawed mediator of money to generate 
                      interference. Thinking about it in this way casts a new 
                      light on the risk to which PAYG schemes are often alleged 
                      to be uniquely vulnerable. This is political risk - the 
                      risk that the state will not honour its pension promises. 
                      Now it is clear that what critics of PAYG must be saying 
                      is either that the government is corrupt, or that a coalition 
                      of non-retired voters is liable to vote down pension expenditures 
                      and divert the money either into projects of more direct 
                      benefit to themselves or into tax cuts. It is not the case 
                      that the state will be prevented from honouring pension 
                      promises by insuperable economic constraints.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      concern about political risk was what Samuelson was talking 
                      about when he noted that socially optimal behaviour may 
                      not be self-enforcing: &quot;if all but one obey, the one 
                      may gain selfish advantage by disobeying - which is where 
                      the sheriff comes in: we politically invoke force on ourselves, 
                      attempting to make an unstable equilibrium a stable one&quot; 
                      (Samuelson, 1958, p480, emphasis in original). The risk 
                      is that this political attempt to provide just pensions 
                      through the mechanism of the state may fail. <br>

                      why should the political system be unable to maintain order 
                      and deal effectively with the 'free rider' problem? Are 
                      people so short-sighted and hedonistic that they genuinely 
                      do not wish to continue the 'chocolate box line' in order 
                      that they benefit in their retirement, but would rather 
                      have more chocolates - the whole box - now, in the short 
                      run? It is not clear that the evidence supports this. People 
                      are well aware, in any event, that they will need to make 
                      some provision for their retirement - they cannot sensibly 
                      immediately eat the extra chocolates that they have refused 
                      to pass to current pensioners. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">A 
                      more likely explanation is as follows. The political risk 
                      is that voters will be frightened into thinking that political 
                      risk threatens their own pension and so rationally seek 
                      to opt out first, before their state pension withers away 
                      to nothing while they have borne the cost of more generous 
                      pensions paid to earlier retirees. The existence of the 
                      free rider problem creates a form of 'prisoner's dilemma'. 
                      The classic prisoner's dilemma consists of two agents with 
                      two options. If the agents cooperate, this provides a superior 
                      outcome to non-cooperation. But there is an incentive for 
                      both agents to renege on an agreement. In this context the 
                      agents will be generations (or cohorts) and the options 
                      will be to vote for a PAYG state pension scheme or to vote 
                      against it. We must also introduce the concept of time, 
                      so that voting is repeated. Consider generations A, the 
                      elder generation, and B, the younger. If both vote for, 
                      then this produces the best outcome for both (as demonstrated 
                      by Samuelson). But if the younger generation expects the 
                      generation following it, generation C, to vote against, 
                      then B must vote against . It is a well known result in 
                      game theory that if it is expected that the other player 
                      will welch on an agreement in the future, then it is rational 
                      to cheat first - to get your retaliation in early. The other 
                      player will realise this, and so ultimately no agreement 
                      is possible. So, in fact, if generation A suspects that 
                      C will vote against and knows that B suspects the same thing, 
                      then it becomes rational for A to vote against. One of the 
                      arguments against PAYG pensions turns out to be circular. 
                      Perceived political risk makes PAYG pensions undesirable 
                      and so threatens their future; but political risk arises 
                      because the PAYG system is under threat. The problem is 
                      that the superior cooperative solution lacks credibility 
                      and this lack of credibility creates the incentive to cheat 
                      (to vote against PAYG state pensions).<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      reason for this lack of credibility would seem to be the 
                      argument that PAYG pensions are unsustainable in the face 
                      of future population ageing. Yet the economics of PAYG pensions 
                      does not support this proposition. Unfortunately, bad or, 
                      at best, selective economic arguments can be just as powerful 
                      as sound economics, and if it is more easily popularised 
                      then more so. Other contributors to the pensions debate 
                      take economic 'realities' as the basis for their own argument. 
                      For example, David Shapiro's otherwise impressive paper, 
                      providing a political philosophical analysis of social insurance 
                      based pensions, accepts the possibility of crowding out 
                      as empirical fact (Shapiro, 1997). No wonder PAYG is regarded 
                      as a pariah. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It 
                      would be the nightmare of any well educated economist that 
                      fallacious or doubtful economic argument should be used 
                      as the justification for abandoning a desirable social compact 
                      (PAYG) in favour of reliance on a flawed one (money for 
                      pre-funding). Yet this appears to be the danger. It is high 
                      time that economists paid heed to Abba Lerner and exploded 
                      some fairy tales again. In the meantime, let us proceed 
                      to the third strand of this paper's argument.<br>

                      demise of overtly 'Keynesian' economic policy and the rise 
                      of the New Right, with its calls for greater self-reliance 
                      and less state welfare, more competition and less state 
                      intervention, has led to an increased emphasis on the individual 
                      and a scepticism toward any actions by the state which would 
                      alter the market-determined distribution of resources. Lawrence 
                      Mead has argued that the debate about today's social problems 
                      is not a debate about social justice. Conditions in society 
                      are more in dispute than society's values. According to 
                      Mead, the debate is moral - why do some people commit crime 
                      and not work unquestioningly within the current social order? 
                      (Mead 1997, p.226). In this author's view, this will have 
                      to be changed if a citizen's pension is to become a serious 
                      contender. However, it is not an objective of this paper 
                      to contribute directly to changing this situation. Rather, 
                      it is an assumption in what follows that, if there were 
                      a debate about social justice, then there would emerge a 
                      consensus in favour of rather more substantial redistribution 
                      than is allowed for under a minimalist system of means-tested 
                      welfare.<br>

                      justification for making this assumption is that Crusoe's 
                      predicament makes it abundantly clear that in fact we are 
                      all inter-dependent, and that there may be situations where 
                      collective action is better than relying on transactions 
                      made as individuals in the market. The public view characterised 
                      by the Panorama interviewee mentioned above would appear 
                      to reflect this tension. Some acknowledgement of our interdependence 
                      and our individual vulnerability in the face of the market 
                      seems to lead people to wish to see some notion of social 
                      justice assured; or, at least, there is a genuine sense 
                      of loss at the passing of the aspirations of the Beveridge 
                      welfare state. On the other hand, economic reality, as presented 
                      in the media and popular debate, appears to preclude the 
                      possibility of anything more than minimalist poverty alleviation.<br>

                      &quot;There is no evidence either that richer people are 
                      less in sympathy than poorer ones with increases in public 
                      spending [on health, education and 'universal welfare benefits'] 
                      even if they are asked to pay a higher share of the tax 
                      burden to finance them. Indeed, supposedly against their 
                      interests, they appear to be more inclined to favour increases 
                      in expenditure when financed through progressive rather 
                      than regressive tax instruments.&quot; <br>

                      for more substantial redistribution have a long history. 
                      John Rawls' 'maximin' principle will be one of the most 
                      familiar. In this context, Rawls requires people to imagine 
                      themselves to be in the 'original position', before any 
                      economic activity takes place and not knowing whether they 
                      will subsequently be successful in the market economy and 
                      acquire sufficient resources to ensure a comfortable retirement. 
                      Private insurance policies could be purchased to cover the 
                      risks that might prevent the individual from achieving this, 
                      but in reality insurance is not purchased in the original 
                      position. It is purchased only once the 'veil of ignorance' 
                      has been at least partially lifted and people have begun 
                      to operate in the markets and have discovered something 
                      about their life chances. This is why insurance companies 
                      charge different rates to different buyers - they are able 
                      to identify different risks and charge more to insure those 
                      in high risk occupations against illness or injury, for 
                      example. Insurance is not a substitute for state intervention 
                      in line with the maximin principle, which states that things 
                      should be ordered to maximise the welfare of the least well 
                      off. Insurance companies are in the business of minimising 
                      redistribution by increasing the accuracy of their pricing, 
                      subject to the constraint of the cost involved in doing 
                      so. Only the state can systematically redistribute resources 
                      in line with society's wishes.<br>

                      contention of this paper is that, if society's view of social 
                      justice requires some redistribution beyond minimalist poverty 
                      alleviation, then a universal benefit, such as CP in the 
                      case of redistribution in favour of the elderly poor, financed 
                      on a PAYG basis, is the best way to achieve that redistribution.<br>

                      tax system is no longer to be used explicitly to redistribute 
                      from rich to poor, in part at least, because of the effects 
                      of such attempts on incentives. In the limit, as suggested 
                      earlier, the abuse of the tax base may actually reduce tax 
                      revenues. This argument is famously associated with Arthur 
                      Laffer and his eponymous curve , reportedly introduced to 
                      government by being sketched on a paper napkin for a White 
                      House Chief of Staff in 1974. (Davidson &amp; Davidson,

                      taxes have not contributed much to income redistribution 
                      in the UK anyway. The benefits system has long been far 
                      more significant, as shown by the Office for National Statistics' 
                      analysis of 'The Effects of Taxes and Benefits on Household 
                      Income' (Harris, 1977 and Stuttard, 1998). This analysis 
                      makes use of the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality 
                      using a scale of 0 to 100. A higher value of the coefficient 
                      indicates a greater degree of inequality, and by examining 
                      the Gini coefficient for different measures of income the 
                      impact of taxes and benefits can be isolated. Thus the Gini 
                      coefficient for what is termed original income (household 
                      income before any benefits or taxes) was 43 in 1977 and 
                      54 in 1993/4, indicating increasing inequality. Gross income 
                      is calculated by adding to original income all cash benefits 
                      received. The Gini coefficient for this measure of income 
                      was 29 in 1977 and 37 in 1993/4. The fact that these values 
                      are so significantly lower shows that the distribution of 
                      household income after the payment of cash benefits was 
                      considerably less unequal than prior to those payments. 
                      Deducting direct taxes from gross income produces what is 
                      known as disposable income, and Gini coefficients are published 
                      for this measure of income also. The comparable figures 
                      for 1977 and 1993/4 were respectively 27 and 34, revealing 
                      a rather modest further reduction in inequality. The same 
                      observation, that cash benefits are far more important in 
                      redistributing income than is the direct tax system, appears 
                      to be broadly valid for the period from 1961 to 1977 as 
                      well.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">If 
                      society wishes to redistribute income, then it seems the 
                      way to do it, historically as well as on the basis of economic 
                      principle, is via cash benefits rather than progressive 
                      taxation. This view is in line with that expressed earlier 
                      that PAYG pensions should be financed in the way that minimises 
                      leaks from the bucket. Moreover, it is vital that the benefits 
                      used be well designed and operate efficiently, for ill-conceived 
                      benefit payments can cause leaks just as surely as can tax 
                      deductions. The universality of a benefit reduces the disincentive 
                      effects and distortions inevitably generated by any other 
                      benefit design. The distortions created by the UK tax and 
                      benefits system are comprehensively described in Parker 
                      (1995).<br>
                      As argued above, a PAYG system allows society to choose 
                      how it wishes to redistribute real consumption. A self-imposed 
                      and unnecessary requirement for pre-funding transfer payments 
                      reintroduces the flawed mediator of money and can only hinder 
                      the process.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">One 
                      of the critiques offered of PAYG welfare schemes is that 
                      they may lead to inter-generational redistribution. That 
                      is, a PAYG pension scheme may cause the lifetime incomes 
                      of some cohorts of people to be higher than they would otherwise 
                      have been, at the expense of other cohorts. This is the 
                      second equity issue to be addressed in this section. Does 
                      such inter-generational redistribution occur and, if so, 
                      does it matter? It is worth stressing that it matters to 
                      the policy debate in that some writers, such as Shapiro 
                      (1997) assume that it does occur and argue against PAYG 
                      pensions on this ground. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      a paper addressing directly the first of these questions, 
                      Hills (1992) acknowledged that the generation in or nearing 
                      retirement when a welfare state is introduced will be net 
                      beneficiaries - they get two boxes of chocolates in Hills's 
                      analogy. The reason for this is that they will have contributed 
                      little to the scheme over their lifetime because for most 
                      of their lifetime the scheme did not exist; but if the scheme 
                      includes pensions and health care then, as older persons, 
                      they will benefit significantly in their twilight years. 
                      However, this need not be at the expense of following generations 
                      - each gives and receives a box of chocolates and so is 
                      neither a net gainer nor a net loser. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Other 
                      generations may also get out of the system more than they 
                      put in and so be net gainers in this sense, but there are 
                      two possible reasons for this. The first is that growth 
                      in GDP may swell the size of the boxes of chocolates over 
                      time, so that the box a generation receives from its successors 
                      is larger than the one it gave away to its predecessors. 
                      One can think of the gains of future economic growth being 
                      shared (redistributed) among generations, and there may 
                      be a sound argument to support this which will be outlined 
                      below. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      second reason is that there may be change in the size of 
                      the boxes of chocolates arising from things other than GDP 
                      growth (or decline). The hypothesis is that generations 
                      succeed in modifying the welfare system to their advantage 
                      over time. For example, a generation will benefit at others' 
                      expense if welfare spending is skewed towards education 
                      when that generation is in the child-rearing phase of life, 
                      but then subsequently skewed towards pension spending when 
                      that generation retires. This would be a case of one generation 
                      &quot;gaining selfish advantage&quot;, in Samuelson's terms, 
                      by free riding. <br>
                      Note that a generation may be a net loser in circumstances 
                      of falling GDP but long periods of falling GDP are rare 
                      in modern industrial capitalist societies. In any event, 
                      if one is sanguine or even positive about sharing the gains 
                      of GDP growth across generations, then one is presumably 
                      equally comfortable with sharing the pain of GDP decline. 
                      A PAYG pension scheme could ensure that a generation whose 
                      working years are blighted by depressed economic conditions 
                      is not further penalised in retirement by their failure 
                      to save sufficiently during that comparatively difficult 
                      working life.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Discussion 
                      of the inter-generational equity of PAYG schemes all too 
                      often confuses these two sources of redistribution. For 
                      example, Shapiro talks of later generations being burdened 
                      with a &quot;low rate of return&quot; on their pension contributions 
                      (Shapiro, 1997, p.129). By this he means that what a cohort 
                      gets out of the system is not much greater, and possibly 
                      less, than what they contributed. However, as described 
                      above, this could be due to low GDP growth, and if this 
                      is the case then it can be expected that it would also affect 
                      pre-funded pensions. If one wishes to argue that the rate 
                      of GDP growth is deleteriously affected by PAYG pensions 
                      then one has to counter the arguments outlined earlier that 
                      showed this is not easy to demonstrate, either in theory 
                      or empirically.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      sort of inter-generational redistribution that Hills was 
                      looking for was that due to changes in the size of the boxes 
                      of chocolates arising from things other than GDP growth 
                      (or decline). Hills's empirical work was on the welfare 
                      state as a whole, including education, health and social 
                      security, but it led him to conclude that the UK's welfare 
                      state had not so far led to any inter-generational redistribution 
                      of this sort. Even if Hills had found the reverse, it would 
                      be incorrect to argue for the abolition of PAYG schemes 
                      on the basis that there was this kind of inter-generational 
                      redistribution. If other characteristics of PAYG schemes 
                      are desirable, then the appropriate response would be the 
                      same as the response to criticism of the current method 
                      of financing PAYG pensions (by a payroll tax) as discussed 
                      above - to seek a solution to this particular problem.<br>

                      consider the argument in favour of sharing the gains of 
                      future economic growth. It should be remembered that the 
                      high level of GDP per capita enjoyed by current generations 
                      is not solely the result of those generations' endeavours. 
                      They benefit from capital produced and work done by preceding 
                      generations. For instance, the UK population still enjoys 
                      the benefit of sewers and bridges built by the Victorians. 
                      The issue of the justifiability of inter-generational redistribution 
                      is thus complex. For, with hindsight, it is not clear that 
                      the Victorians would not have been justified in establishing 
                      a PAYG pension scheme whereby those generations would have 
                      shared a little of the benefits of future GDP growth to 
                      which their infrastructure construction had contributed. 
                      In this connection, it would be possible to devise an accounting 
                      system for the state's finances which justified the payment 
                      of a pension out of taxes on the younger members of society 
                      on the basis that the retired have contributed to the provision 
                      of social infrastructure - roads etc. - through their own 
                      efforts and their previous tax payments .<br>

                      beneficial operation of the free market. Many non-economist 
                      academics, policymakers and other commentators, as well 
                      as laypersons, take this as a given fact. The discussion 
                      above has shown that in fact the economic case against PAYG 
                      pensions is far from compelling. The size of the 'burden' 
                      of the retired population on the working population is affected 
                      only by the number of pensioners and cannot be altered by 
                      changing the way in which their consumption is financed, 
                      whether by PAYG state pensions or pre-funded private pensions. 
                      The costs of pensions which can differ according to how 
                      those pensions are financed are lower and less visible to 
                      non-economists. They are two classes of costs: the costs 
                      of the resources used to administer the pension system; 
                      and the lost output arising from what Okun termed the leaks 
                      from the bucket used to transfer resources from one group 
                      to another - in this case to the retired. The choice of 
                      financing mechanism therefore can have divergent effects 
                      on the economy, but economic theory provides no unambiguous 
                      predictions of these. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">One 
                      of the possible malign effects of PAYG schemes may be relatively 
                      easily tackled, by moving away from taxes on employees and 
                      employers in favour of less damaging taxes such as 'eco-taxes'. 
                      The effect on investment and economic growth due to the 
                      crowding out of private saving is equally theoretically 
                      uncertain, and nor does the empirical research conducted 
                      provide any conclusive evidence against PAYG.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">There 
                      is a positive case to be made for PAYG on the ground that 
                      it has advantages in dealing with certain risks, and in 
                      particular inflation risk. To provide pensions which the 
                      National Pensioners Convention would regard as something 
                      worthy of the name, ie with predictability of value, PAYG 
                      is perhaps ultimately essential.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">If 
                      there is a desire for some redistribution in favour of the 
                      less well off, and it seems unarguable that this is the 
                      case in relation to the retired portion of the population, 
                      then this requires state action. A CP financed on a PAYG 
                      basis is the most attractive approach to achieving this. 
                      Arguments about inter-generational redistribution arising 
                      from PAYG schemes are often confused and, when properly 
                      formulated, such redistribution does not appear to be a 
                      serious concern.<br>
                      In short, any pension system appropriate for the twenty-first 
                      century requires an element of state provision financed 
                      on a PAYG basis and this provision should ideally be universal.

                      introduction in the late 1980s. Amongst the proposals is 
                      one for a standard local housing allowance which would allow 
                      tenants who find accommodation for less than the standard 
                      amount to keep the difference. The proposal, to be trailed 
                      in ten 'pathfinder' areas, is for a flat rate allowance, 
                      based on area and family size. <br>

                      experienced by people with disabilities. The Foundation's 
                      working party examined the 'personal assistance trap': &quot;the 
                      mechanism by which disabled people, in receipt of cash or 
                      support, find themselves deterred from seeking work because 
                      of the punitive charge which local authorities can make 
                      against them if they find themselves a job. These charges 
                      are so severe that disabled people's disposable income can 
                      often be left not much more above Income Support levels 
                      even for those earning an average of &pound;20,000 a year.&quot; 
                      While the working party was at work, the Government announced 
                      that income from earnings would be disregarded in any financial 
                      assessment. The group went on to study remaining barriers 
                      to employment, and concluded that &quot;financial and benefit

                      as follows: &quot;The extent of inadequate [social] protection 
                      is high (between 10% and 30%) even in countries with well 
                      established [though differing] minimum income schemes such 
                      as Belgium, Denmark and the UK. Groups over-represented 
                      among the non-covered population include the elderly, those 
                      with disabilities, single parents, students, school-leavers 
                      and non-nationals. Five main causes of inadequate protection 
                      have been examined: non-eligibility for minimum income (e.g. 
                      among foreigners, travellers, homeless people), sanctions 
                      and suspensions (particularly in unemployment insurance), 
                      non-take-up, inadequacy of benefits, and deductions made 
                      from benefits to pay arrears of utility bills etc. Only 
                      20% to 25% of all minimum income recipients were reintegrated 
                      each year into the labour market in the period 1993-95 in 
                      Belgium, Denmark and the UK. The differences between the

                      of losing sight of what the welfare state is about. It was

                      and preventing us from falling into deeper disadvantage 
                      as a result. &#133; The best way to help the poor within 
                      the welfare state is not to target programmes more carefully 
                      on the poor, but the converse: to ensure that there is a 
                      general framework of resources, services and opportunities 
                      which are adequate for people's needs, and can be used by

                      Donnelly writes: &quot;The Wirral is a des-res peninsula 
                      between the Mersey and the Dee, mostly well off but with 
                      areas of acute deprivation. In the summer of 2002 I was 
                      invited to a Debt and the Way Out hearing in Wallasey. From 
                      the start it was clear that it was to be a hearing for voices 
                      of the debt-ridden, not an occasion for the affluent to 
                      come along and sympathise. There were speakers, some splendid 
                      mime by a theatre group, and the welcome presence of the 
                      Mayor of Wirral Borough council, who spoke warmly of the 
                      venture and stayed long enough to meet the participants. 
                      There were workshops in the afternoon. Mine was on Citizen's 
                      Income, and once again we saw how men were uneasy about 
                      getting something for nothing, as they put it, while women 
                      as usual had no difficulty in seeing the merits of CI. There 
                      were personal testimonies from veterans of the benefits 
                      obstacle race, which recalled Bill Jordan's words in 1984, 
                      that the tax and benefits system is in a mess. It still 
                      is; along with some over-all improvements, the forms are 
                      even longer, and the questions even more intrusive, all 
                      intended to push people into what Hermione Parker once called 
                      'busy-busy make-work jobs'. <br>

                      the old funding debate was still going in circles: who is 
                      going to pay for a Citizen's Income ? My preference would 
                      be for an optimum income, based on production rather than 
                      hours of employment. Now that French economics students 
                      have begun to protest successfully against classical economic 
                      theory there is a chance for some really new thinking about 
                      funding BI/CI. I hope so.&quot;</font></p>

                      subject or U.K. citizen? The question is still open and 
                      the evidence is ambiguous. One looks at the buzz words and 
                      slogans: taxpayers' money, prudence, rights and responsibilities, 
                      them and us, standing on our own feet, targeting those in 
                      need and so on and so on and one can well ask the questions: 
                      'who is it all for?' and 'who owns it all?' <br>

                      then one thinks of the administration of the tax and benefits 
                      systems and the minimum income guarantee for pensioners 
                      and one is forced to the conclusion that the majority of 
                      Britons are slaves, working for that supreme slavemaster, 
                      Her Majesty's Treasury.<br>
                      But it doesn't need much to visualise a change from 'British 
                      subject' to 'U.K. citizen'. The first thing to do is to 
                      abolish the use of the word 'taxpayer' as a means of differentiating 
                      between 'them' and 'us' and, by inference, as a term of 
                      abuse towards those who have the misfortune not to be in 
                      a position to pay any or much income tax. The second thing 
                      is to recognise that each U.K. citizen has, or ought to 
                      have, equal status before the law. One person, one vote. 
                      It does not require much of a stretch of the imagination 
                      then to extend that to mean that each citizen has an equal 
                      share in everything the state (collectively) owns: the public 
                      property, the things, be they roads, schools, hospitals, 
                      government buildings, museums, tanks, fighter bombers - 
                      the lot, that are in the public domain or are part of the 
                      nation's heritage.<br>

                      have recently heard a government adviser say that the government 
                      does not make a good shareholder. But the government, as 
                      representative of the people as a whole, can own things. 
                      It can manage things. It can decide, and may have to decide, 
                      when it is better to get other people to manage things for 
                      it. It can account for things. It must account for things. 
                      It can also recognise when markets fail, or are rigged, 
                      and act as a stabilising force accordingly.<br>

                      abrogate responsibility to that latter-day deity, 'the market'. 
                      Markets fail and, as anyone with any experience of the City 
                      knows, markets can be rigged. <br>

                      the state owns has been built up, over the years, from investment 
                      out of taxes (and, possibly, borrowings), from assets that 
                      were acquired by conquest or by custom, and it is all capable 
                      of being valued at today's prices. Roads at current cost, 
                      with allowance for depreciation; the same for schools and 
                      hospitals and the rest. All of it is ours, not 'theirs'. 
                      In general, it ought not to be for sale by this generation 
                      for its own benefit. Much of it has some sort of monopoly 
                      status in the British way of life. Most, if not all, has 
                      an aspect of public service attached to it.<br>

                      few people want to see it privatised - which is not to say 
                      that private sector management couldn't be brought in to 
                      manage it from time to time. But actual ownership is important 
                      and that belongs to the people as a whole, not just to that 
                      sub-class of people described as taxpayers, nor to the lucky 
                      participants in a privatisation offer for sale, nor to the 
                      winners of some (mostly bogus) process of competitive bidding

                      things have gone wrong is that most of these assets have 
                      become disconnected from the people. The proprietorial link 
                      has gone. The break has come with the questioning of society 
                      as an entity. Reductions in income tax over time have been 
                      matched by reductions in the services the state provides 
                      and, especially, the run-down of the assets involved.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      National Asset Register is a place to start. Everything 
                      in it could be transferred on Day 1 into a National Pension 
                      Fund. Also, the roads, schools, hospitals and the rest. 
                      The beauty of this scheme is that these assets all keep 
                      their value in line with inflation. What is missing so far 
                      is that the nation as a whole, which owns the assets, has 
                      not been properly accounting for depreciation, nor giving 
                      the owners a return on capital, both of which need to be 
                      set aside out of the general fund of taxation. This is not 
                      hypothecation; it is simply prudent accounting.<br>
                      Cash flow into the National Pension Fund would also include 
                      a part of National Insurance contributions, together with 
                      credits for individuals unable to make a contribution in 
                      any particular year and, if necessary, something more out 
                      of general taxation. Payments out would be state pensions, 
                      no longer means-tested, at the minimum income guarantee 
                      level, plus investment in infrastructure. That is investment 
                      for the future. Fresh investment might not be required if 
                      the population started shrinking. The level of pension is 
                      for political decision, but has to be adequate to live on.<br>

                      National Pension Fund would thus be comparable to a private 
                      sector pension fund. It would not, in principle, hold stock 
                      market assets, but its assets would all be inflation-linked 
                      in value and would earn an administered rate of return (something 
                      like that on index-linked government stocks, the risk-free 
                      rate of return, currently 2-2.5% plus inflation). (There 
                      is a precedent for an administered rate of return. The independence 
                      of the Bank of England is subject to the requirement to 
                      keep inflation within a specified band.)<br>

                      New Labour came to power, it proclaimed a wish for people 
                      to have security. The setting up of a National Pension Fund 
                      is an important step in that process. A further advantage 
                      of this proposal is that, once the level of the state pension 
                      has been set, an automatic annual increase of 2-2.5% over 
                      inflation can be built in, no problem, as an equivalent 
                      to the earnings link. The disadvantage is the loss of the 
                      Chancellor's ability to decide by how much to uprate pensions.<br>

                      is a neglected, but profound, truth in economics: that one 
                      cannot save spending power. One can only use investments 
                      that promise a future call on spending power. Share of GDP 
                      is what is in question. The current balance of dividends, 
                      interest and taxation is not providing security for our 
                      pensioners. A mechanism that automatically locked in a share 
                      of GDP that produced an adequate pension for all must surely 
                      be an improvement which all would welcome.<br>

                      human person from that of a sovereign individual to that 
                      of a subject of paternalistic supervision. &quot;Hidden 
                      in the shift from rights to conditional support, and from

                      generalise a point which Shaver makes, following Offe's 
                      suggestion that there has been &quot;a loss of political 
                      support for class-based collective strategies of equality 
                      and redistribution,&quot; (p.342): individuals throughout 
                      the Western world now see themselves as over against the 
                      welfare state, evaluating it against other possibilities, 
                      rather than as members of it. In this context, as Shaver 
                      recognises, welfare states (and political parties of the 
                      left) are adapting themselves to this new situation. One 
                      consequence of this adaptation is that the fostering of 
                      equality is no longer an aim (either explicit or implicit)

                      with the ways in which welfare provision is changing in 
                      the UK and the USA. In all three, obligations balance, and 
                      sometimes outweigh, the individual's rights. Whilst these 
                      concepts cohere with the notion of liberal social citizenship, 
                      policy changes are beginning to damage the foundations of 
                      such a liberal society. &quot;The shift from support available 
                      as of right to assistance provided on condition violates 
                      the presumption that all citizens are equal in status, dignity 
                      and worth that is necessary for full participation in democratic 
                      society. The shift from the presumption of individual sovereignty 
                      to welfare supervision entails levels of intrusion into 
                      spheres of privacy and individual volition that have been 
                      highly protected in liberal society. Much of the development 
                      of twentieth-century welfare has been concerned with the 
                      assertion of equality in precisely these respects. It is 
                      this development of equal social citizenship that contemporary 
                      liberal welfare reform is now putting in question&quot;

                      (quoted from our Bulletin no.16) as part of the same process, 
                      away from a citizenship of belonging and towards a citizenship 
                      of active participation - with the corollary that anyone 
                      not participating is no longer regarded as a citizen. <br>

                      maybe the difference is one of degree rather than of kind. 
                      If the criteria for 'participation' were to be drawn sufficiently 
                      broadly then there would be few members of the population 
                      not receiving the participation income, especially if it 
                      were to be paid to those adults deemed unable to participate 
                      actively in society by virtue of illness or disability. 
                      Atkinson's own criteria are very broad, and the Citizen's 
                      Income Trust's research when he first made the proposal 
                      ten years ago suggested that only about 1% of the population 
                      would not be receiving the participation income - meaning 
                      that it would be cheaper to pay a Citizen's Income than 
                      to continue to administer a participation income which would 
                      require the policing of participation criteria.<br>

                      there is a shift going on in our understanding of citizenship,

                      to drive that change. Child Benefit, by ameliorating the 
                      poverty and unemployment traps, represents a citizenship

                      nature of the research and its careful conclusions will 
                      be of considerable service to policy-makers. The researchers 
                      conclude that &quot;there have been very different rates

                      1995 and 2000, and claimant numbers have declined in the 
                      wards with the highest claim rates even if claim rates haven't; 
                      but in 2000 there were still 3.8m claimants of Income Support, 
                      Job Seeker's Allowance and Invalidity Benefit in England, 
                      and about half of them lived in the 20% of wards with the

                      this. It would bring into the spotlight not only the ways 
                      in which location and personal characteristics influence 
                      the probability of leaving benefit, as the researchers suggest: 
                      it would also enable questions about disincentives to be

                      is about democracy and the different ways in which the population 
                      might control the levels of the MAW and the UGI; chapter 
                      5 is a short passage on different types of society; chapter 
                      6 offers justifications for MAW and UGI; chapter 7 offers 
                      a history of Islam and discusses Islamic taxation and its 
                      treatment of wealth; chapter 8, in discussing economic incentives, 
                      suggests that the MAW offers an incentive to the wealthiest 
                      to increase others' wealth so that they will vote for a 
                      higher MAW; chapter 9 discusses practical approximations

                      chapter 10 is about financial benefits and costs; chapter 
                      11 is about realisability; and chapter 12 is on ramifications 
                      in relation to ecology, budget deficits, etc.. There is 
                      an appendix containing questions for further study or discussion

                      a class to discuss the feasibilities of a government-controlled 
                      Citizen's Income and of a democratically-controlled UGI, 
                      and to ask itself whether a 100% tax rate (which is what 
                      a MAW would imply for high earners) would ever be politically

                      and expenditure measures are commonly used to establish

                      to measuring the extent and composition of poverty in the 
                      UK. Using UK data (and also Australian data) the researchers 
                      compare these two measures and find that while the overall 
                      poverty rates are similar whichever measure is used, the 
                      relativities they imply for different types of household 
                      differ considerably. They find that there is little overlap 
                      between income and expenditure poverty, and that very few 
                      households are both income- and expenditure-poor.<br>

                      authors define their own concept of poverty as constraint 
                      on choice or constrained expenditure, and identify its presence 
                      by discovering where there is absence of spending on durable 
                      goods and luxury items. They then derive income thresholds 
                      for observed levels of constrained expenditure for different 
                      types of household. They assume that in such households 
                      all income is spent, and they are thus able to define poverty 
                      lines below which expenditure is severely constrained. Income 
                      support rates are then compared with these poverty lines.<br>

                      expenditure, and makes suggestions as to how new poverty 
                      measures might be calculated by employing both income and 
                      expenditure data; but its longer term importance surely 
                      lies in its definition of poverty as constrained expenditure. 
                      If this is to be the definition of poverty, then it will 
                      be essential to include in the definition of poverty a household's 
                      ability and opportunity to increase its income. If there 
                      are significant barriers to a household increasing its income 
                      then expenditure will be more constrained over time and

                      be less constrained over time and poverty will be less deep.

                      and of the international context is followed by a discussion 
                      of the contradiction between our individual-based income 
                      tax system and the family-based Working Tax Credit (which 
                      will soon replace the Working Families Tax Credit and the 
                      Disabled Person's Tax Credit) and CTC (Child Tax Credit: 
                      the new name for the integrated child credit). A welcome 
                      proposal is that no upper capital limit will apply to receipt 
                      of CTC: instead, actual investment income will be taken 
                      into account. This will make tax credits more like the rest 
                      of the income tax system. Similarly, there will be no work 
                      test for CTC, with assessment being made purely on the basis 
                      of family income.<br>

                      because it will be received by low earners it will provide 
                      a new level of income security during employment-pattern

                      in his editorial, &quot;getting people from welfare to work 
                      is last year's problem, and a comparatively easy one at

                      Dickens, in his article 'Is welfare to work sustainable?', 
                      discusses the increases in both relative and absolute poverty 
                      which have taken place between 1979 and today, commends 
                      the government for taking a variety of steps to remedy the 
                      problem, suggests that the current work-based policy is 
                      not enough because it &quot;may shift individuals into long-term 
                      in-work benefit dependency and possibly in-work poverty&quot; 
                      (p.88), and concludes that those who move in and out of 
                      low-paying jobs will remain in poverty because job retention 
                      is low and there is little progression into higher-paid 
                      jobs. &quot;Perhaps another strategy that the government 
                      should take more seriously is to tackle the primary earnings 
                      distribution&quot; (p.89).<br>

                      response to the problem which Dickens discusses, there are 
                      new policy initiatives here and in other countries aimed 
                      at supporting people in employment through a case-work approach. 
                      Karen Kellard's article, 'Job retention and advancement 
                      in the UK: a developing agenda', examines new policy in 
                      the UK, and in 'The road to sustained employment: lessons 
                      from a US job retention intiative', Anu Rangarajan discusses 
                      new developments in the USA. Both articles conclude that 
                      flexible schemes tailored to individuals' needs are what 
                      is required.<br>
                      A rather different approach is 'Workfare': compulsion to 
                      accept employment (State-provided if necessary), the refusal 
                      of which results in loss of benefit. In 'Rhetoric and retrenchment: 
                      'common sense' welfare reform in Ontario', Dean Herd finds 
                      that, far from being the success it is claimed to be, a 
                      Canadian workfare scheme has removed large numbers of people 
                      from benefits by &quot;reducing welfare services and tightening 
                      eligibility requirements&quot; (p.105). <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">When 
                      read together these well-researched articles argue for an 
                      entirely 'carrot' approach: that is, if work doesn't pay 
                      (literally), then 'making work pay' won't work as a means 
                      of 'welfare to work'. An important means of making work 
                      pay must surely be to reduce the marginal tax rates which 
                      people suffer. Tax credits have reduced these to between 
                      60% and 70% for most low-earners. This is not low enough. 
                      The problem is, of course, that if, under the present structure, 
                      they are reduced further, then disincentives are moved further 
                      up the earnings scale. The only answer to this particular 
                      part of the problem is to replace tax allowances and tax 
                      credits with an unconditional cash payment and then to tax 
                      all or most earned income at rates lower at the bottom of 
                      the earnings scale than at the top.<br>

                      'layers' are used to measure the extent of opportunity for 
                      employment: 1. those factors over which an individual has 
                      no control (such as age); 2. those factors over which someone 
                      has no control at present (such as educational achievements);

                      but where high costs of various kinds might be experienced 
                      (such as place of residence); and 4. those factors which

                      constraints in layers. If the model predicts that someone 
                      has a high probability of being in work, and he or she is 
                      not in work, then they are regarded as voluntarily out of

                      parental social class, then British Household Panel Study

                      market experience and education are also regarded as beyond 
                      an individual's control, then 20% of men and 31% of women 
                      not in work are voluntarily so; and if place of residence 
                      and family responsibilities are also regarded as beyond

                      by many people who enter the employment market, and another 
                      (less quantifiable) constraint is the uncertainty people 
                      experience about the level of change in net income. It is 
                      one thing to know that net income will rise very little 
                      if you enter employment; it is another not to know how much 
                      income will rise or fall, whether free school meals will 
                      still be available, or how long it will take to recalculate

                      replacement of 'poverty' with 'social exclusion' in political 
                      debate is not merely a change of terminology designed to 
                      include in the debate those who think that there is no such 
                      thing as poverty (though it is that), for 'social exclusion' 
                      encompasses a field of interest broader than that encompassed 
                      by 'poverty'. For one thing, the new terminology draws attention 
                      to someone's exclusion from active participation on family, 
                      community, national, and global levels, and it invites a 
                      dynamic analysis rather than snapshots of people's resources 
                      at a particular time. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      first and second chapters explore the meaning of 'social 
                      exclusion' by relating social inclusion to social justice 
                      and social solidarity in such a way as to suggest that an 
                      increase in inequality translates into an increase in social 
                      exclusion. Chapter 3 seeks measurable definitions of participation 
                      in order to measure social exclusion (though because consumption, 
                      production, political engagement and social interaction 
                      relate to outcomes rather than restraints, measurable definitions 
                      of disincentives to participation are not sought - and surely 
                      disincentives to participation are an important part of 
                      the definition of social exclusion). Chapter 4 studies poverty 
                      dynamics, i.e. the ways in which people move in and out 
                      of poverty, and concludes that there is a group of people 
                      who experience poverty more often than most. Chapter 5 is 
                      on social exclusion across the generations; chapter 6 shows 
                      how family resources affect people's experience of social 
                      exclusion; and chapter 7 shows how Housing Benefit, Council 
                      Tax Benefit and the Working Families Tax Credit reduce incentives 
                      to employment and thus increase social exclusion. (This 
                      is particularly important because poverty in low-wage families 
                      affects children and increases the likelihood of their social 
                      exclusion). Chapter 8 is on the effect of concentrations 
                      of disadvantaged people in particular neighbourhoods; chapter 
                      9, on child poverty, suggests that an adequate minimum income 
                      is necessary for those out of work to prevent their children 
                      from experiencing poverty; and chapter 10 shows that some 
                      social policies aimed at preventing social exclusion can 
                      simply move the problem elsewhere (for instance, policy 
                      aimed at keeping the unemployment count low can increase 
                      the number of people claiming sickness benefit) and that 
                      policies which respond to existing social exclusion are 
                      needed to prevent existing social exclusion from causing 
                      more social exclusion in the future. Chapter 11 is on education's 
                      role in preventing social exclusion; chapter 12 is on the 
                      relationships between social infrastructure, community participation 
                      and social inclusion; and in chapter 13 John Hills asks 
                      whether a focus on social exclusion changes the policy response 
                      and concludes that a dynamic analysis is needed: for instance, 
                      it is important to help families to reduce from two earners 
                      to one earner rather than from two earners to no earners 
                      so that it can then more easily return to being a two-earner 
                      family. In this connection universal benefits are recommended, 
                      not because they redistribute income differently at a particular 
                      time (which they don't necessarily) but because they contribute 
                      to social solidarity and thus decrease social exclusion.<br>
