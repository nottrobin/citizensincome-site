                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Whenever 
                      the political prospects for radical reform of tax and benefits 
                      are discussed, and particularly the likelihood of any reform 
                      which includes a Citizen's Income as a major constituent, 
                      it is always said: such radical reform could not be achieved 
                      within a single parliament so no government will ever even 
                      think about it. (The same comments are made about major 
                      transport infrastructure investment. No government wants 
                      a future government of a different political hue to reap 
                      the rewards generated by current spending.) <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">A 
                      recent opinion poll might begin to change the tone of this 
                      debate. The Fabian Society and YouGov have recently conducted 
                      a poll amongst 2,506 electors and discovered that 54% want 
                      political parties to have policies which will do good in 
                      the long term and not just during the next year or two (a 
                      figure higher than for any other characteristic: only 13% 
                      of electors would support a political party because it had 
                      firm ideological principles). <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      result suggests that parties in government will do themselves 
                      good rather than harm by pursuing policies which will benefit 
                      society in the longer term. So we look forward to the political 
                      agenda changing, and to priority being given to those longer-term 
                      issues which for too long have been neglected. In particular 
                      we would like to see a Royal Commission on the options available 
                      for tax and benefits reform. It will do the government no 
                      harm.<br>

                      you want to know what's going on in the world of benefits 
                      reform then there really is no substitute for obtaining 
                      a copy of the Tax Benefit Model Tables and spending a little 
                      time understanding the tables and graphs of this excellent 
                      annual publication. The April 2003 Tax Benefit Model Tables 
                      (Department for Work and Pensions, 2003) are particularly 
                      interesting because they show the full effect of the new 
                      tax credits regime. Disturbingly, they reveal deep and broad 
                      poverty traps which affect many types of family.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">By 
                      the 'depth' of the poverty trap we mean the extent of the 
                      marginal deduction rate, i.e., the rate at which income 
                      is withdrawn for any particular level of earned income. 
                      So, to take the example below, a lone parent who is a private 
                      tenant and who has one child under 11 experiences a marginal 
                      deduction rate of 89.5% for any earned income within the 
                      range &pound;126.44 to &pound;321.81. By the 'breadth' of 
                      the poverty trap we mean the of earned incomes for which 
                      there is a high marginal deduction rate: so here the breadth 
                      of the poverty trap is defined by an earned income of &pound;321.81 
                      per week. <br>

                      with children which suffer the deepest and the broadest 
                      poverty traps. All families with children (whether with 
                      one parent or two) experience marginal deduction rates of 
                      over 60% on gross earnings at least up to &pound;300 per 
                      week and often beyond &pound;400 per week, and some family 
                      types experience marginal deduction rates of over 80% on 
                      gross earnings up to &pound;300 per week. This situation 
                      makes it difficult for families with children to lift themselves

                      contribute to marginal deduction rates is Child Benefit. 
                      This is because Child Benefit is paid unconditionally, so 
                      to increase it is to reduce child poverty because 1) it 
                      increases the net income of families with children, and 
                      2) it reduces the marginal deduction rates for families 
                      with children and thus enables families to lift themselves

                      in the deepening and broadening of poverty traps are Working 
                      Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. Whilst the motives for 
                      their introduction were excellent (and they have indeed 
                      reduced poverty for many families with children), their 
                      long-term effects might be little short of disastrous because 
                      they make it very hard for families with children to earn

                      to increase their net income by improving their skills and 
                      increasing earned income (good for them, and good for the 
                      economy), then the obvious way forwards would be to reduce

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      our last edition we published a report on Citizenship and 
                      a Citizen's Income in which the working party which prepared 
                      the report recommended that the electoral register might 
                      be used as the basis for entitlement to a Citizen's Income.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Philip 
                      Vince writes as follows:<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                      is no possibility that the electoral register will ever 
                      be complete enough to be the basis for entitlement to a 
                      Citizen's Income. Even though electors now have the option 
                      to be excluded from the edited version publicly available 
                      and to be included only in the full version to which access 
                      is restricted, many people still fail to register. This 
                      is a criminal offence, but it is rarely, if ever, enforced. 
                      (Incidentally, some electoral registration officers have 
                      found ways of including people with no address).<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      concept of finding out where everyone lives by canvassing 
                      from door to door is irremediably flawed. This is demonstrated 
                      by recent decennial censuses, in which it is estimated that 
                      several hundred thousand inhabitants (about 1% of the population) 
                      are unaccounted for. This has resulted in negotiations between 
                      the Office for National Statistics and local authorities 
                      to guess what is the real population of each area because 
                      central government financial support is determined by this. 
                      It is anarchic that the state does not know where so many 
                      of its inhabitants reside. There are a few people, such 
                      as women avoiding abusive ex-partners and witnesses threatened 
                      in some criminal cases, who are entitled to keep their addresses 
                      secret, but we must repudiate the notion of civil liberties 
                      zealots that there is a right to privacy about where one 
                      lives. I believe that in most other European countries there 
                      is better information provided to government about changes 
                      of address.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                      is essential that the database of names and addresses of 
                      all residents is maintained continuously, not updated periodically 
                      like the electoral register. The social security database 
                      is the best source. For children under 16 omissions are 
                      likely to be negligible. For the adult population it may 
                      be less complete, even though it is now linked to the income 
                      tax database to enable tax credits to be paid. The introduction 
                      of a Citizen's Income could provide an incentive to anyone 
                      who has avoided a social security record to be included 
                      in future. However, payment will in most cases be made to 
                      bank accounts, so that arrangements would still be needed 
                      to ensure that all permanent changes of address were notified. 
                      When deaths are registered, the social security authorities 
                      have to be informed; maybe all permanent changes of address 
                      should be registered, with similar social security notification.<br>
                      The requirement for recipients of Child Benefit to have 
                      been in the country for 26 weeks during the past year applies 
                      to the mother, so it is almost always satisfied from the 
                      date of the child's birth. It would not be sensible to require 
                      legitimate migrants to the UK to wait six months before 
                      they became entitled to a Citizen's Income.<br>
                      The right to a Citizen's Income is linked to the duty to 
                      pay tax on all other income, and therefore ought to be paid 
                      to legally resident aliens as well as to those who have 
                      British nationality (unless they arrange to pay tax to their 
                      home country and not to the UK). There are complex Inland 
                      Revenue rules about domicile and being ordinarily resident, 
                      and the rules about entitlement to a Citizen's Income, and 
                      indeed to citizenship, would need to be aligned with these 
                      (though they would not necessarily need to coincide with 
                      them).<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      Citizen's Income regime includes the replacement of contributory 
                      retirement pensions by enhanced Citizen's Incomes for citizens 
                      above certain ages. However, it is reasonable that payment 
                      of these increases should be subject to residence for a 
                      minimum number of years, perhaps twenty, in the UK or in 
                      a country with which we have reciprocal arrangements. Conversely, 
                      we should pay Citizen's Incomes to any who meet the UK's 
                      residence requirements but have chosen to retire abroad 
                      in countries with which we do not at present have reciprocal 
                      arrangements. <br>

                      are expected over the four month period. The organisers 
                      describe the Forum's purpose as follows: &quot;The profound 
                      changes wrought by the globalisation process have brought 
                      new challenges and opportunities which affect our present 
                      and shape our future. The Universal Forum of Cultures provides 
                      a meeting point and platform for dialogue, where people 
                      from the world over can come together to look for solutions 
                      and jointly tackle the questions addressed.&quot; The three 
                      focal themes of the forum are &quot;Cultural diversity&quot; 
                      (&quot;constructive dialogue among different peoples&quot;), 
                      &quot;Sustainable development&quot; (&quot;new ways of growing 
                      that respect natural resources&quot;) and &quot;Conditions 
                      for peace&quot; (especially &quot;respect for other cultures 
                      and for the environment&quot;).<br>

                      are many ways to slice analytically the pensions question; 
                      by slicing along the gender dimension the author has not 
                      only exposed the key debates around this particular variable 
                      but has thrown the whole messy area of pension reform into 
                      sharp relief. Much of the problem with the pension debate 
                      is, perhaps surprisingly, not ideological. Whatever side 
                      of the political spectrum protagonists come from they have 
                      similar desires to see reasonable income smoothing over 
                      a lifetime and that the measures taken to ensure this are 
                      efficient and, in some measure, equitable. While a lack 
                      of consensus on what constitutes 'equity' is one of life's 
                      political certainties, the pensions problem is racked with 
                      many more uncertainties than the average political battleground: 
                      the long time-horizon, the difficulties of balancing structural 
                      incentives with broader freedoms and the avoidance of crippling 
                      burdens on government. This latter especially, given the 
                      knowledge that the markets in this area are prone to failure, 
                      creates a complex series of interwoven problems. To sift 
                      through the multiple dimensions is not easy. To have the 
                      courage to de-emphasise some issues to achieve clarity and 
                      to guard the analytical capacity to aid understanding is 
                      a rare skill that is ably demonstrated in this book.<br>

                      great deal of the text and figures is given over to an efficient 
                      yet highly readable pr&eacute;cis of the recent history 
                      and current state of the pension arena in the UK and, occasionally, 
                      other countries. This is far from being merely a quick rehash 
                      of old material, nor is it of limited use due to the focus 
                      on the gender dimension. There is a purposefulness and clarity 
                      about the material that is often missing in more general 
                      works. The tables are especially well presented with the 
                      complexity of the data and the referencing of sources being 
                      acknowledged but without becoming troubling or intrusive. 
                      Unlike many books of this kind it is well enough presented 
                      to 'dip into' with the attention being caught by well chosen 
                      and presented data that then lead on to a deeper analysis

                      the work really scores for me, as a student of political 
                      science and former policy maker, is in its head-on approach 
                      to the reality of problems. Thorny issues such as miss-selling, 
                      the systematic failure of private pensions for specific 
                      groups and the scale of information failure are handled 
                      impressively. The issues are neither glossed over nor lingered 
                      on unnecessarily - they are given their place within the 
                      analysis and addressed in an illuminating manner. Direct 
                      criticism is rare and is reserved mainly for failures to 
                      take account of what should have been stunningly obvious

                      This book is for anyone who has an interest in the equity 
                      issues of pension reform, offering as it does not just a 
                      specific analysis on gender but a model for many analyses 
                      of a similar nature. The only people who might find they 
                      are skipping chapters are those who have read, inwardly 
                      digested and understood an impressive range of Organisation

                      Work and Pensions and Office for National Statistics statistical 
                      publications - but it is to be hoped that even experts can 
                      appreciate new presentations and different emphases of such 
                      data.<br>

                      broad conclusion that emerges from the work is that policy 
                      makers must take notice of the gender issues. There have 
                      been major changes in social roles and labour market involvement 
                      for women both flowing upward from social change and imposed 
                      downward by evolving government policy, but what becomes 
                      clear in the final account is that the system that failed 
                      women of a previous generation will, even after reform, 
                      do no better in giving women the security in old age that 
                      all citizens deserve. Pension strategies across all spheres 
                      need to be examined and adapted so that tomorrow's generation 
                      of taxpayers will not have to pay for today's failures. 
                      Without action today such failures are fated to fall on 
                      the governments whose predecessors ignored them.<br>

                      is a collection of essays discusses the political writings 
                      of Philippe Van Parijs, who is best known for his advocacy 
                      of basic income (BI) in <i>Real Freedom for All: What (if 
                      anything) can Justify Capitalism </i>(1995). Inspired by 
                      the works of Rawls and Dworkin, Van Parijs defines a philosophy 
                      which he calls 'real libertarianism', which holds that the 
                      most just society is the one that maximizes the least advantaged 
                      individual's 'real freedom' - the freedom to do whatever 
                      he or she wants to do. Van Parijs argues that an unconditional 
                      basic income would maximize the real freedom of the least 
                      advantaged, and that the productivity of capitalism, harnessed 
                      to provide the highest sustainable basic income, could justify 
                      capitalism. Before reaching that conclusion he discusses 
                      the issue of whether basic income would exploit workers 
                      and how society should compensate for disadvantages such 
                      as handicaps.<br>

                      essays in <i>Real Libertarianism Assessed</i> provide a 
                      valuable and in-depth evaluation of Van Parijs's theories. 
                      All the authors agree about the quality and value of Van 
                      Parijs's work, although some disagree substantially with 
                      his conclusions and make important criticisms.<br>
                      Cunliffe, Erreygers, and Van Trier trace the origins of 
                      the basic income idea to Joseph Charlier, writing as early 
                      as 1848, and Mabel Milner, Dennis Milner, and Bertram Pickard, 
                      writing in 1918-1920. These authors offered justifications 
                      for BI that differ substantially from Van Parijs's. They 
                      derived the right to BI from a right to use the land to 
                      produce one's own subsistence. Although equal claim to land 
                      as one of many &quot;external assets&quot; is important 
                      to Van Parijs, he explicitly rejects any justification for 
                      BI based on a need for subsistence.<br>
                      Peter Vallentyne clarifies and criticizes Van Parijs's use 
                      of the principle of self-ownership, which Van Parijs uses 
                      in a much more limited way than traditional libertarians. 
                      Vallentyne believes Van Parijs is right to deny that self-ownership 
                      includes a right to appropriate natural resources, but that 
                      he goes too far when he denies that self-ownership includes 
                      the right to benefit from one's own brute luck advantages, 
                      such as being more physically able and therefore more productive.<br>

                      Barry, although a supporter of basic income, raises very 
                      difficult questions about Van Parijs's justification of 
                      it, the most difficult being that the concept of real freedom 
                      is too weak to justify basic income. According to Van Parijs, 
                      real freedom is the ability to do whatever one might want 
                      to do <i>regardless of whether one actually wants to do 
                      it</i>. Therefore, Barry argues, two different opportunity 
                      sets can only be ranked against each other if one dominates 
                      the other. That is, only if set A has all the available 
                      options in set B plus more, can we say that A has more real 
                      freedom than B. But imagine a society in which everyone 
                      faces the same budget constraint, and the government wants 
                      to impose either a guaranteed job or a guaranteed income. 
                      Basic Income would give people some combinations of labour 
                      and leisure that would be unavailable with a guaranteed 
                      job, but the guaranteed job would probably also offer other 
                      combinations of labour and leisure that would be unavailable 
                      with a guaranteed income. Therefore neither of them necessarily 
                      has more real freedom than the other, making it extremely 
                      difficult to build a case for basic income from the point 
                      of view of maximizing real freedom.<br>

                      van der Veen responds to Barry's criticism by saying that 
                      in his example everyone faces the same budget constraint, 
                      and are all equal in terms of real freedom to begin with. 
                      This response is inadequate, however, because Van Parijs 
                      argues not that real freedom should be equalized, but that 
                      it should be as high as possible. Even though we can tell 
                      real freedom is equal in this community, we cannot tell 
                      whether this community has more real freedom with or without 
                      BI. Van der Veen goes on to argue that BI could offer more 
                      real freedom than a guaranteed job would, but that is an 
                      empirical question which is very difficult to answer conclusively 
                      using only deductive reasoning.<br>
                      Arneson attacks BI's ability to deliver real freedom rather 
                      than real freedom's ability to justify a universal BI. As 
                      he puts it, &quot;Making the BI grant as high as possible...would 
                      include...individuals who are above average in the real 
                      freedom they enjoy, but who happen to have a strong preference 
                      for leisure over income-generating activity. The redistribution 
                      policies that society establishes could do more to advance 
                      the real freedom of the least advantaged if they were better 
                      targeted at the least-advantaged.&quot; This is a question, 
                      I believe, which real libertarians will have a hard time 
                      answering. <br>

                      Reeve and Stuart White are critical of basic income in general 
                      because they see it as potentially allowing non-workers 
                      to live off, and so exploit, workers. However, they both 
                      write chapters which are quite sympathetic to Van Parijs. 
                      Reeve questions van Parijs's inclusion of jobs as part of 
                      his list of &quot;external assets that can be taxed without 
                      exploiting self-owning individuals,&quot; but he believes 
                      this argument only reduces the potential size of the basic 
                      income, not its validity. White's chapter promotes a principle 
                      of 'fair reciprocity' in which individuals owe society a 
                      productive contribution in exchange for a high minimum share 
                      in the social product. Basic income, he says, would allow 
                      a very important breech in this principle. People who live 
                      off a level of basic income that requires effort on the 
                      part of others to sustain should feel obliged to fulfil 
                      a reciprocal obligation to contribute to that effort. BI 
                      does not hold people to that obligation. But he argues that 
                      it does have several reciprocity-enhancing effects on equal 
                      opportunity, enabling non-market contributions to the social 
                      product, the reduction of domestic abuse, improved job quality, 
                      and serving as a residual safeguard against brute luck disadvantage 
                      and market vulnerability. Thus, he concludes, a modified 
                      basic income such as a time-limited BI or a participation 
                      income combined with a basic capital grant could be part 
                      of a reciprocity-focused system.<br>

                      White, of the University of Oxford, is a rising star in 
                      political theory. Over the past eight years, he has written 
                      more than a half dozen articles on the &quot;reciprocity 
                      objection&quot; to basic income. Fair reciprocity, as White 
                      defines it, states that all those who enjoy a high minimum 
                      share of the benefits of social cooperation owe a corresponding 
                      obligation to contribute to that society in return (p.17). 
                      This point of view seems antithetical to basic income, but 
                      White is sympathetic to the arguments of basic income advocates, 
                      and he is concerned to find a policy that balances the concerns 
                      of both sides.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">White's 
                      new book, <i>The Civic Minimum</i>, brings together many 
                      of the themes from his articles into a coherent theory of 
                      a social system, laying out the rights and obligations that 
                      follow from his theory of &quot;justice as fair reciprocity.&quot; 
                      It is not a book about basic income but one in which the 
                      basic income debate features prominently in a discussion 
                      of how to organize an economic system in accord with basic 
                      principles of justice. It manages to discuss these issues 
                      at a high level of political theory while still being compelling, 
                      interesting to read, and closely connected to the current 
                      policy debate.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Fair 
                      reciprocity, as defined by White, has three characteristics: 
                      First, citizens have social rights. Second, these rights 
                      are instrumental to a radically egalitarian distributive 
                      goal. Third, &quot;Where these rights secure a citizen a 
                      sufficiently generous share of the social product, and sufficiently 
                      good opportunities for productive contribution, citizens 
                      have definite, and potentially enforceable, obligations 
                      to make a productive contribution to the community in return&quot; 
                      (p.17). In its ideal form, fair reciprocity must be made 
                      in the context of institutions that fully correct for unequal 
                      access to the means of production and to inequalities of 
                      natural ability, but, as White recognizes, this is impossible 
                      to achieve fully. In its non-ideal form, fair reciprocity 
                      demands only that society satisfies a threshold of equal 
                      opportunity. It needs to eliminate the proletarian condition 
                      by minimizing class inequality and by ensuring that every 
                      citizen has access to jobs that give them above-poverty 
                      wages, opportunities for self-realization, and security 
                      against abuse and vulnerability (p.19). Where this threshold 
                      of basic fairness exists, citizens are obliged to reciprocate 
                      the benefits they get from society with a productive contribution 
                      in the form of socially desirable paid labour or at least 
                      some unpaid work such as care-giving (p.18). This obligation 
                      exists not only for recipients of government transfers but 
                      also for everyone who benefits from social cooperation, 
                      including those most advantaged in the market. It implies 
                      that there can be no work requirement unless all able-bodied 
                      people, both rich and poor, are equally held to it (pp.136-137).<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">White 
                      finds no strong moral case for a universal unconditional 
                      basic income (p.168), but he does find several strong instrumental 
                      (or practical) arguments for basic income even from the 
                      standpoint of fair reciprocity. First, the reduced need 
                      for workers to rely on their wages for day-to-day survival 
                      could improve the flexibility of the labour market, leading 
                      to higher levels of employment and increased employment 
                      opportunities for everyone. Second, basic income could function 
                      as a social wage for people who make productive contributions 
                      that aren't adequately compensated by society. Third, by 
                      making non-earning parents financially independent BI could 
                      reduce domestic exploitation and abuse. Fourth, basic income 
                      would put employers under pressure to improve job quality, 
                      increasing opportunity for self-realization in work. Fifth, 
                      BI would function as a residual safeguard against significant 
                      brute luck disadvantage and market vulnerability which a 
                      non-ideal system of fair reciprocity might fail to eliminate 
                      (pp.166-168).<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">These 
                      last two practical arguments are, I believe, very much in 
                      tune with the reasons which lead many basic income supporters 
                      hold the position they do, and they are very closely connected 
                      with White's arguments for what constitutes non-ideal fair 
                      reciprocity. As he puts it, &quot;Vulnerability arises from 
                      the pressing need to sell one's labour power. If, however, 
                      individuals have a source of income that is independent 
                      of the immediate sale of their labour power&#133;they need 
                      not suffer the acute dependency, and corresponding loss 
                      of freedom, characteristic of the proletarian condition&quot; 
                      (p.132). <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">However, 
                      White does not believe these arguments for basic income 
                      are decisive because there may be other policies that could 
                      achieve these goals without having the undesired effect 
                      on reciprocity (pp.169-170). He cites an excellent quote 
                      from Leonard Hobhouse: &quot;It seems sometimes to be regarded 
                      as quite a providential arrangement that some should be 
                      born without the necessity of working for their own living 
                      so that they have leisure to impose this fundamental duty 
                      on others.&quot; Those who do not view this arrangement 
                      as providential tend to break off into two camps, those 
                      who want to relieve everyone of this duty to work and those 
                      who want to find a fair way to enforce the duty to work 
                      on rich and poor alike. White's book is largely an exploration 
                      of the second strategy.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">White 
                      justifies his use of the second strategy by making several 
                      strong arguments that basic income supporters will find 
                      difficult to answer. Three of these stand out in importance. 
                      First, he argues that fair reciprocity follows from and 
                      encourages a belief in democratic mutual regard. If one 
                      group seems to benefit from the work of others without contributing 
                      themselves, they break the feelings of solidarity that make 
                      commitment to a generous social system possible.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Second, 
                      he argues that there is a direct connection between reciprocity 
                      and work, which has great intuitive appeal, and which is 
                      best summarized by a quote from a recent article:<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Imagine, 
                        for example, that we institute a 'social right' assuring 
                        all citizens of a decent minimum of income. If, as a citizen, 
                        I accept that there is such a right-and that it is an 
                        equal right held by all citizens, not merely a privilege 
                        peculiar to me-then I must also accept that each citizen,

                        (real) income requires that work be done, then, as part

                        citizens of this income, I surely have a prima facie obligation

                      pay for jobs is actually a rent from either the imperfect 
                      market for those jobs or on the technology that mixes with 
                      labour. The &quot;jobs as assets&quot; argument was pivotal 
                      to Van Parijs's influential case for the highest sustainable 
                      basic income, but White makes a strong rebuttal. True as 
                      it may be that part of the return to labour is a rent, he 
                      argues, output still requires work and it makes sense to 
                      divide the output amongst those who are willing to work. 
                      He uses an excellent example to illustrate his claim (161-162). 
                      He specifically applies this example to technological rent, 
                      but by analogy it demonstrates a weakness in the entire 
                      'jobs as assets' argument. Two people are shipwrecked and 
                      spend a day swimming and unsuccessfully trying to catch 
                      fish with their hands. The next day they wash up on an island 
                      where a previous generation of inhabitants left an abundant 
                      supply of fishing equipment. One fishes all day. The other 
                      refuses to fish, but asks for half of the catch at the end 
                      of the day citing the fact that the entire catch is attributable 
                      to a rent on their joint property-the land and technology-without 
                      which her labour was useless. Such a claim is as obviously 
                      weak as it is obviously true. It is similarly weak for someone 
                      to claim the rental portion of the wages on jobs they refuse 
                      to perform. Van Parijs argues that society should be neutral 
                      between people with different preferences for labour, but 
                      White replies that neutrality does not trump other demands 
                      of justice, and that a preference for living off someone 
                      else's efforts could be just such a preference (pp.158-159).<br>

                      are three general ways in which Basic Income supporters 
                      could answer White's challenges. One is to argue that fair 
                      reciprocity is not an important principle of justice or 
                      at least that there are other principles of social justice 
                      that are more important. Another is to accept reciprocity 
                      as a value, but argue that it does not conflict with basic 
                      income because, for example, the case for basic income derived 
                      from the value of assets is stronger than the version of 
                      that argument he addresses in this book, or empirically 
                      that no one will fail to contribute. A third response would 
                      be to accept the reciprocity principles which imply that 
                      everyone should work but to make the instrumental case for 
                      basic income strong enough to make it acceptable on balance 
                      despite its negative side-effects on reciprocity.<br>
                      One instrumental argument against White's case for enforced 
                      reciprocity is to note the huge complexity of the system 
                      he builds to combine the enforcement of reciprocity with 
                      concerns for fairness towards the people who are being held 
                      to that obligation. Reading through the book reveals an

                      of these programmes would be expensive. Most of them would 
                      require a large bureaucracy with a very large overhead cost, 
                      so that the taxes needed to support the system would be 
                      much greater than the benefits received by those in need. 
                      The complexity would also create obvious disadvantages in 
                      terms of transparency and understandability. Some of the 
                      policies (such as the requirement that even those who have 
                      saved a sufficient amount of money must work a set number 
                      of hours) seem unenforceable without a rather harsh regulatory

                      White's proposal to Anthony Atkinson's basic income/flat 
                      tax proposal, 2 which would replace all these programs (except 
                      the equal opportunity provision) with <i>one </i>tax and 
                      <i>one</i> benefit in a system that would require minimal 
                      bureaucratic administration. The Civic Minimum is not a 
                      moderate alternative to basic income but a far more radical 
                      restructuring of the entire economy. <br>

                      complexity is necessary to make sure that people at all 
                      points in the economic hierarchy follow the norm of fair 
                      reciprocity. Some restrictions are to make sure that recipients 
                      of public benefits fulfil their obligations, others are 
                      restrictions on people with higher incomes which are necessary 
                      because White recognizes that society cannot force the poor 
                      (through their vulnerable condition) to work for a system 
                      that is not fair to them. This turns out to be an enormous 
                      task requiring items 2, 3, 5, 9, and 10 on the list above. 
                      To build a system fair enough to demand such participation, 
                      he has to attempt to build capitalism without unearned income, 
                      if such an ambition is possible. White seems to admit that 
                      the confiscatory levels of income and capital taxes needed 
                      to assure that no one lives without work would be unsustainable, 
                      and we well have to accept that some wealthy people will 
                      live comfortably without working. If this is the correct 
                      interpretation, why then is it so important to make sure 
                      that not one recipient of transfers lives without working? 
                      Why does solidarity allow the better off to demand that 
                      every single able-bodied person on the minimum works, but 
                      solidarity does not allow those on the minimum to demand 
                      that every single person above the minimum works? If this 
                      is not the correct interpretation, are we really ready to 
                      accept the radical changes that would be necessary to ensure 
                      that our society has no people so rich that they need not 
                      work? Do we really know how to do that? For those of us 
                      who believe that the belief in &quot;striking it rich&quot; 
                      is the linchpin of capitalism, it does not even seem possible.<br>

                      do we get for all of this complexity? Apparently, the benefit 
                      appears to be that it allows society to exclude those few 
                      who don't meet their obligations of fairness. The system 
                      is nearly as universal as basic income; a relatively small 
                      number would be left out and only after many second chances. 
                      But what happens to them? White argues convincingly that 
                      the Civic Minimum is universal in the sense that there is 
                      universal access to it for people who are willing to fulfil 
                      their obligations (138). But, as extensive as White's policy 
                      prescriptions are, he does not answer the question of what 
                      to do with people who fall below the minimum; nor does he 
                      argue that there will be no such people. Should there be 
                      a sub-minimum for non-reciprocating indigents or should 
                      nonworking homeless people be left to fend for themselves 
                      somehow until they wise up and enter the system? He mentions 
                      an unconditional right to access to land but concludes that 
                      a case for unconditional benefits based on it is incomplete 
                      (168), and I do not understand what he intends those who 
                      stand outside of the cooperative obligation to have. Basic 
                      income, by contrast, would pick these people up into its 
                      universal benefit. The fact that fair reciprocity can exclude 
                      people is supposed to be an advantage. Certainly, a society 
                      putting non-ideal fair reciprocity would have far fewer 
                      homeless than the present system, but is the great advantage 
                      of the civic minimum over basic income that when we pass 
                      beggars in the street, we will know that in the context 
                      of a basically fair though non-ideal system, there is an 
                      acceptable likelihood that they deserve to be beggars? Or 
                      should the already lengthy list of programs be enlarged 
                      to include the services for non-reciprocating indigents?<br>

                      editors' introduction debates the meaning of 'sustainability' 
                      and posits three possible ways in which demands and resources 
                      can be more evenly matched: &quot;The first way (weak sustainability) 
                      is to expand the stock of resources. This can be done by 
                      replacing renewable resources, by substituting for non-renewable 
                      ones and by searching for technological solutions to depletion 
                      and pollution. A second way (strong sustainability) is to 
                      revise the demands that we make on the world so that, for 
                      instance we consume far less. So, rather than adapting the 
                      world to suit ourselves we adapt ourselves to meet the finitude 
                      of nature. The third way (moderate sustainability) is to 
                      combine elements of those two approaches. Each of these 
                      implies a subtly different conception of sustainability&quot; 
                      (p.3). The question follows: Are existing welfare systems 
                      compatible with any of these definitions ? - for current 
                      welfare systems are based on the notion of economic growth 
                      and on productivist policies, and they themselves contribute 
                      to unsustainability; and the editors identify welfare systems' 
                      relationship to wage-earning as an important part of the 
                      problem. As Fitzpatrick and Cahill conclude: &quot;Welfare 
                      states have developed in concert with an employment society&quot; 
                      (p.9).<br>

                      following chapters offer a variety of perspectives on the 
                      relationship between ecological concerns and economic and 
                      welfare systems and their possible reform. John Barry suggests 
                      that the ethical basis for a sustainable society is already 
                      in place, and that what we need to do is put it into practice; 
                      Matthew Humphrey describes 'Green ideology' as &quot;a full 
                      fledged, independent ideology&quot; (p.59) with distinctive 
                      practical outcomes - such as a Basic Income; Michael Cahill 
                      stresses the importance of the local; Tim Jackson asks how 
                      we might get from where we are now to a more sustainable 
                      social policy without doing new damage along the way - for, 
                      whilst a recession would result in fewer natural resources 
                      being consumed, it would also cause social damage; Meg Huby 
                      concentrates on public utilities and government's role in 
                      her discussion of the sustainable use of resources; Colin 
                      Williams discusses Local Exchange and Trading Systems (LETS) 
                      and the social economy in general; and Adrian Little discusses 
                      a possible conflict between the rights-and-responsibilities 
                      argument for working time reductions and the responsibility-to-future-generations 
                      perspective of Green ideology.<br>

                      Fitzpatrick's first contribution is a more theoretical chapter 
                      on ecosocial welfare as a thought-experiment which goes 
                      beyond liberal democracy; his second is a thorough discussion 
                      of a Citizen's Income (called here a Basic Income). In many 
                      ways this is a summary of his excellent <i>Freedom and Security: 
                      An Introduction to the Basic Income Debate </i>(London: 
                      Macmillan 1999), but it is constructed around the reasons 
                      which Greens might offer for either supporting or opposing 
                      a Basic Income - for instance: a Basic Income &quot;guarantees 
                      a minimum income for all and challenges the employment ethic, 
                      but it also seems to depend upon the ecologically very damaging 
                      activities to which Greens object&quot; (p.150). The chapter 
                      concludes with a call for Greens to mobilise behind short-term 
                      aims as well as long-term ones, and recommends that one 
                      of those short-term aims should be a Citizen's Income.<br>

                      book's final chapter is by James Robertson, who recommends 
                      eco-taxation as a means of funding a Citizen's Income, and 
                      recommends both eco-taxation and a Citizen's Income as means 
                      towards a more sustainable society.<br>

                      is a thought-provoking book, and should be read by anyone 
                      interested in a sustainable society - for in fact it is 
                      more about that than it is about welfare systems. The fact 
                      that a Citizen's Income is the subject-matter of one chapter 
                      and is given a thorough airing in three others speaks for 
                      itself. If the book's contributors had stuck more firmly 
                      to their brief of relating the environment to welfare, then 
                      we would have had a book at the heart of which would have 
                      been a strong argument for the Citizen's Income route to 
                      benefits reform.</font></p>

                      Security in 2001, and it is thoroughly international in 
                      its content. The first part contains international comparisons 
                      of child poverty: on why child poverty is higher in the 
                      US than in Europe; on the UK, and the importance of surveys

                      organisers rarely exercise editorial control - and this 
                      collection is certainly diverse. Professor Bradshaw has 
                      provided an 'Introduction and Overview' at the beginning, 
                      and this provides a sense of cohesion. It might have been 
                      interesting if he had also supplied a concluding chapter 
                      suggesting, on the basis of the evidence contained in the 
                      papers, what kinds of benefit regime would be most likely 
                      to reduce child poverty. His views on the effects of higher 
                      rates of universal benefits (such as the UK's Child Benefit) 
                      would have been informative.<br>

                        fundamental difference between these major figures as

                        as the goal of welfare reform. Gordon Brown has an essentially 
                        one-dimensional view where the object of his tax credit 
                        strategy is to increase the income of the poor. This is

                        considered. Lloyd George shared Gordon Brown's objective 
                        of channelling more money to the poor. But of equal importance 
                        to Lloyd George was the objective of combining increases

                        means-testing, the greater is the restriction on their 
                        freedom. Tax credits make it impossible for a growing 
                        army of individuals to improve their family's income and 
                        well-being by working harder or longer or gaining additional 
                        qualifications&quot; (pp.4f).<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      chapter itself is a mine of historical and contemporary 
                      information and of relevant comment and is a powerful argument 
                      for work-incentives. Gordon Brown's tax credits will provide 
                      such an incentive in the first year of the scheme - but, 
                      as Field correctly notes, &quot;in welfare it is the long-term 
                      impact of policies which is of key importance&quot; (p.54), 
                      and, with Brown's system, &quot;once a person is into the 
                      tax credit system, few will be able by their own efforts 
                      to escape&quot; (p.57). Ironically, a new welfare dependency 
                      has been created by the government which said that it intended 
                      to end such dependency, and Brown has created a ceiling 
                      and not the kind of floor on which people can build, which 
                      Lloyd George created with his contributory pensions and 
                      Trade Union administered unemployment benefits. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Whilst 
                      chapter 4 is somewhat negative in tone, because it is an 
                      argument against means-testing rather than an argument for 
                      a solution, chapter 2 is more positive. It is equally against 
                      means-testing, and particularly against the pensioners' 
                      minimum income guarantee (and now its replacement by a tax 
                      credit), but it also makes a recommendation: a stakeholder 
                      pension to which people have to contribute. Elsewhere, Field 
                      recommends that the value of tax credits should be frozen, 
                      tax rates reduced, and a higher state pension introduced, 
                      as a means of reducing people's dependency on means-tested 
                      benefits, and he concludes: &quot;That welfare reform has 
                      to be built so that it works with the grain of human nature 
                      - of directing self-interest so that it promotes work, savings 
                      and honesty - is a lesson which [he] thought had been learnt 
                      before Labour's 1997 election win. That lesson will have 
                      to be learnt again, but this time in the wake of a collapsing 
                      tax credit system&quot; (p.7). The argument clearly leads 
                      in the direction of universal benefits (for there can be 
                      no firmer 'floor' than automatic, nonwithdrawable benefits 
                      such as Child Benefit), but these don't get a mention. This 
                      is a pity. If Field doesn't like this particular option 
                      for reducing the influence of means-testing then somewhere 
                      in a book like this he should at least have told us why 
                      he doesn't like it.<br>
                      There is some fascinating historical material in this short 
                      book, on education and health care as well as on income 
                      maintenance strategies, and there is some equally fascinating 
                      political theory, particularly relating to the freedom of 
                      the individual citizen. The Institute for the Study of Civil 
                      Society is to be commended for publishing this collection 
                      of lectures and papers, and Frank Field is to be congratulated 
                      for writing what's in it. It's only a pity that he didn't 
                      remain a bit longer in government, and particularly that 
                      he wasn't there long enough to prevent the extension of 
                      means-testing which tax credits represent. <br>

                      is the Joseph Rowntree Foundation's fifth annual report 
                      on levels of poverty and social exclusion in Great Britain. 
                      The report contains statistics related to fifty indicators 
                      covering income, health, education, employment and engagement 
                      in community activity. The first chapter contains pages 
                      on income measures, then come chapters on children, young 
                      adults, adults, and older people, and a final chapter on 
                      communities (with material on involvement in civic organisations, 
                      crime, proportions of households without insurance, etc.). 
                      <br>
                      The income indicators show that there has been a small drop 
                      (of 300,000) between 1999/2000 and 2000/2001 in the number 
                      of people on incomes below 60% of median income, and that 
                      we are now back at the 1995/6 level. This is welcome. But 
                      at 12.9 million the figure is double what it was 20 years 
                      ago. (This rather suggests that the Foundation's sister 
                      organisation, the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, ought 
                      to replace its recently discontinued poverty programme with 
                      one aimed at long-term issues relating to income distribution).<br>
                      As always, this report is highly informative, extremely 
                      clear and accessible, and of considerable practical value 
                      to policy-makers and all involved in policy debates.</font></p>
