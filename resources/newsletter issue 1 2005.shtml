                      of proposals falling under the rubric of universal basic 
                      income, and the potential diversity of arrangements that

                      raises a question about that rubric, debated before in this 
                      newsletter and also on our website: the question of terminology. 
                      Since the first Basic Income European Network congress in 
                      1986 the terms 'Basic Income' and 'Citizen's Income' have 
                      referred to an unconditional payment to every individual 
                      as a right of citizenship, paid automatically, and nonwithdrawable. 
                      The article employs the term 'Basic Income' to denote a 
                      family of schemes, the schemes characterised by a diversity 
                      of conditionalities, withdrawabilities and coverage. The 
                      question is: Should 'Basic Income' and 'Citizen's Income' 
                      be used to denote only schemes in which nonwithdrawable 
                      payments are made to every individual unconditionally, or 
                      should the meaning of the terms be stretched to cover other 
                      income maintenance programmes sharing one or more of the 
                      characteristics of a Citizen's Income ? <br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
                      the past decades the debate on the desirability and feasibility 
                      of universal basic income has reached maturity. Associated 
                      with a growing number of scholars, social activists, public 
                      advocacy groups and political parties, basic income is no 
                      longer perceived as yet another crackpot idea of the radical 
                      left. Indeed, it is increasingly accepted that basic income 
                      advocates have something valuable to contribute to the debate 
                      on welfare reform and employment regulation. But with maturity 
                      comes the need to rethink the ideal of a universal basic 
                      income. As the debate expands, the standard definition of 
                      basic income as an income granted by right to each individual, 
                      without means test or work requirement, may no longer capture 
                      the diversity of policies advanced within the basic income 
                      community and beyond.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                      article contributes a first step to this enterprise by charting 
                      the many faces of universal basic income. Our starting point 
                      is the belief that successfully implementing a universal 
                      basic income crucially depends on our being able to match 
                      the design features of a particular scheme with the surrounding 
                      policy context or administrative environment, which differs 
                      extensively from one country to another. This, in turn, 
                      requires a better appreciation of the wealth of proposals 
                      falling under the rubric of universal basic income, and 
                      the potential diversity of arrangements that exist at the 
                      level of concrete design and implementation. It is towards 
                      this latter task that this article is specifically directed.<br>
                      </font></p>

                      devil in the detail</b><br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For 
                      many scholars and practitioners, basic income constitutes 
                      a distinctive social paradigm within contemporary welfare 
                      theory, leading to vigorous normative arguments and ideological 
                      disputes between its proponents and adversaries. This is 
                      not to say that there is no substantial disagreement pertaining 
                      to form or content of the normative principles underlying 
                      universalism amongst its principal advocates. Neither does 
                      it imply that we must buy into ideological cleavages to 
                      find arguments for or against basic income. In fact, one 
                      of the intriguing aspects of basic income is precisely its 
                      capacity to secure support across the ideological spectrum.1<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Moving 
                      from social philosophy to policy it becomes apparent that 
                      the paradigm of universalism does not constitute a single 
                      identifiable policy, but represents a myriad of social support 
                      schemes that differ substantially along a range of policy 
                      dimensions. Basic income supporters readily acknowledge 
                      that there exists ample choice of which policy to pursue 
                      within a broadly universalist approach. Consequently, the 
                      debate has now moved from defending universalism writ large 
                      to a dispute within the basic income community itself over 
                      the preferred form of basic income. The result is substantial 
                      disagreement at the level of ideal-type policies: some scholars 
                      favour a negative income tax scheme, others advocate an 
                      unconditional basic income or a participation income, and 
                      still others believe stakeholder or basic capital grants 
                      are superior, and so on.2<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, 
                      at the level of fine-grained design and implementation, 
                      apparently similar proposals are even further differentiated 
                      along dimensions that are characteristically not captured 
                      in ideal-type analysis. An additional concern is that universal 
                      schemes that are substantially similar in design may still 
                      end up producing widely divergent outcomes because of different 
                      interaction effects with policies already in place. It is 
                      a mistake to assume that a universal basic income would 
                      operate in something resembling an institutional vacuum. 
                      To the extent that fine-tuned distinctions also produce 
                      distinctive outcomes, both normative and empirically driven 
                      research ought to take differential design features seriously. 
                      In the next section we discern seven principal dimensions 
                      along which concrete basic income proposals can be differentiated.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Universality 
                      refers to the extent of the population that is covered by 
                      a given policy. Typically, universal policies are open to 
                      all, while more selective measures single out a subset of 
                      the population as beneficiaries. One category of subjects 
                      often excluded from even the most universal schemes is non-citizens 
                      (however defined), while more selective measures discriminate 
                      even further to select eligible individuals or groups from 
                      the broader population. Selectiveness immediately invokes 
                      debate regarding the principles and mechanisms employed 
                      to decide on eligibility. In practice this implies building 
                      in some level of conditionality, discussed further below.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      distinction between universal and selective measures, however, 
                      is often overstated on ideological grounds. To begin with, 
                      the label 'universalist' is misleading in cases where policies 
                      are universal in some respects but selective in others. 
                      Most policies in contemporary welfare regimes appear to 
                      fit this mixed-bag category. In addition, a strict divide 
                      between universal and selective measures is easily blurred 
                      in practice. Circumstances typically introduce selective 
                      effects in an otherwise universal policy; conversely, selective 
                      measures may well combine to mimic the effects of a universal 
                      policy.<br>

                      income advocates often favour an incremental approach to 
                      instituting a full basic income. One way in which this could 
                      be done is to have basic income type policies in a specific 
                      domain-child benefit, basic pension or sabbatical accounts-which 
                      are then gradually expanded or 'universalised' over time.3 
                      Here too we must be wary about attaching too much importance 
                      to the label and ignoring what happens on the ground. In 
                      what follows we review various ways in which universal basic 
                      income schemes can be more or less universal, as well as 
                      other salient dimensions in which concrete proposals can 
                      be differentiated.<br>

                      refers to the standard unit at which a policy is directed. 
                      Welfare policy schemes basically face a choice of administering 
                      their services either directly to individuals or indirectly 
                      through a household unit. Basic income is routinely advocated 
                      as a form of income support that caters to individuals. 
                      However, some advocates, mainly for reasons of goodness-of-fit 
                      with traditional approaches in welfare policy, have been 
                      willing to compromise on this and recommend instituting 
                      a basic income targeted to households. The dimension of 
                      individuality therefore does not lose its relevance for 
                      policy purposes. <br>

                      the case of households many questions arise with respect 
                      to the appropriate definition of a household and its internal 
                      composition. Tony Atkinson distinguishes four types of household 
                      units, each with its own delineation and composition problems: 
                      'households' based on common residence; 'spending units' 
                      based on common spending patterns; 'family units' defined 
                      by blood ties or marriage; and finally the 'inner family' 
                      defined in terms of a sustained dependence relationship.

                      from one household base to another in policy design has 
                      been shown to imply up to a quarter of reductions in the 
                      measurement of people on low income.4 Measuring the actual 
                      effects of welfare policies is clearly sensitive to choice 
                      of household type. Similar observations can be made regarding 
                      the administrative challenges associated with targeting 
                      policies to households. These reasons often lead policy-makers 
                      to favour a more individualised approach.<br>

                      a normative point of view, the chief sources of concern 
                      are the often arbitrary discrimination of life-style choices 
                      associated with household-based policies; unacceptable inequalities 
                      between single-income and double-income households and between 
                      single persons and double-income households (sometimes leading 
                      to perverse redistributive effects from the poor to the 
                      well-off); and the fact that non-individualised rights often 
                      generate employment traps or trap partners into a dependency 
                      relation.5 While conservative political factions are often 
                      keen to use welfare policies to strengthen the traditional 
                      nuclear family unit, the increasing variation of living 
                      arrangements within and across generations suggests this 
                      argument may have outlived its usefulness. Although much 
                      attention has recently been devoted to the effects of individualising 
                      benefits on intra-householder power relations, the research 
                      remains surprisingly ambivalent about its implications for 
                      basic income.6<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Conditionality 
                      implies the extent of conditions built into a policy that 
                      may restrict a person's eligibility for a service. Most 
                      welfare policies come with different types of conditions 
                      attached that recipients need to satisfy to gain or maintain 
                      eligibility. Basic income is of course distinctive precisely 
                      in that it is purportedly unconditional or, failing that, 
                      at the very least only employs conditions that do not violate 
                      the programme's inclusiveness. An example of a conditionality 
                      requirement that ostensibly does not affect inclusiveness 
                      is Tony Atkinson's well-known proposal for a participation 
                      income.7<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
                      understand better the dimension of conditionality a number 
                      of distinctions need to be kept in mind. Conditionality 
                      refers in the first instance to formal criteria of eligibility 
                      that either imply a set of characteristics necessary to 
                      acquire eligibility status or, alternatively, impose certain 
                      behavioural constraints to retain eligibility (ex ante and 
                      ex post conditionality, respectively). In addition to these 
                      two main types we can discern hidden or implied forms of 
                      conditionality: a universal basic income can become more 
                      conditional because of the interplay with external contingencies, 
                      which may result in the policy effectively treating recipients 
                      differently within a formally uniform framework. Suppose 
                      we institute a fully unconditional basic income at a variable 
                      level related to a macroeconomic performance indicator such 
                      as GDP or employment rates. The level of the grant decreases 
                      when more people opt out of formal employment or if productivity 
                      decreases below a certain threshold indicator, which serves 
                      as a 'soft incentive' to push people back into work. While 
                      such a scheme does not have any formal conditions attached 
                      to it, it nevertheless institutes a set of incentives to 
                      contribute towards maintaining a certain level of production 
                      or employment.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next, 
                      conditions can be strict or weak depending on whether they 
                      are 'set in stone' or there is a significant measure of 
                      bureaucratic discretion in assessing when a claimant has 
                      satisfied a requirement. Bureaucratic discretion invites 
                      a measure of arbitrariness, and may induce welfare administrators 
                      to engage in behaviour that violates professional standards. 
                      Interestingly, welfare workers often oppose discretion and 
                      prefer a system that rigorously outlines their duties precisely 
                      because they want to minimise the risk of unprofessional 
                      conduct.8 In addition, bureaucratic discretion may boost 
                      administrative error, particularly when rules change rapidly 
                      and become increasingly complex.9 At the same time, basic 
                      income research should be aware of the literature in public 
                      administration and administrative law that points to the 
                      limits of administration 'by rule and rote' and of the appropriate 
                      uses of discretion.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, 
                      conditions can also be narrow or broad depending on whether 
                      they result in more or less exclusive policies-that is, 
                      policies that capture a larger subset of the population. 
                      The Earned Income Tax Credit, for instance, only applies 
                      to those in work, whereas a participation income is meant 
                      to encompass a broader range of activities, and hence a 
                      broader range of target beneficiaries. This of course raises 
                      the precarious problem of who ends up making the decision 
                      to value certain social activities by including them in 
                      the participation requirement. This is not a moot point: 
                      conditions are often introduced within a universal basic 
                      income for political reasons, because decision makers believe 
                      there will not be sufficient political support for unconditional 
                      measures-although occasionally economic grounds are also 
                      put forward as arguments in favour of some conditionality. 
                      On the other hand, increased target efficiency associated 
                      with improved take-up rates is often cited as the strength 
                      of unconditional measures. In practice, the choice of a 
                      basic income scheme and its level of conditionality will 
                      depend in large part on which constraint we believe to be 
                      the stronger.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Uniformity 
                      is the extent to which all those who are eligible receive 
                      a similar level of benefit. Universal basic income schemes 
                      can deviate from this strict interpretation in at least 
                      two ways. First, we may decide to allocate different levels 
                      of transfer to different types of recipients, thus imposing 
                      a form of ex ante conditionality within the scheme. A familiar 
                      example is the use of age to differentiate the allocation 
                      of grants to children, adults of working age and pensioners. 
                      By making good strategic use of a distinction that is already 
                      embedded in existing welfare systems, basic income proponents 
                      have a better chance of bringing basic income in via the 
                      back door. Even noted opponents of unconditional basic income, 
                      such as G&oslash;sta Esping-Andersen, favour universal child 
                      benefits and basic pensions, effectively endorsing a basic 
                      income ideal for a subset of the population. Differentiating 
                      uniformity provides a handy tool for policy design and advocacy.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Contingencies 
                      also affect the uniformity of basic income. Imagine, for 
                      instance, a universal scheme that is formally uniform but 
                      with the value to its recipients fluctuating in line with 
                      a set of external circumstances, such as the regional variation 
                      in cost of living. It is a matter of some discussion whether 
                      a basic income should remain uniform, as argued by Philippe 
                      Van Parijs, or instead regional price differences should 
                      provide a legitimate departure from the uniformity rule.10 
                      Of course, policy-makers may well decide to use the differential 
                      value of the grant to actively influence certain behavioural 
                      traits: like taxes, grants may end up serving multiple purposes 
                      that need to be balanced. In principle, then, both uniformity 
                      and differentiation are consistent with most forms of basic 
                      income. Of course, one should keep in mind that at the margin 
                      a heavily differentiated scheme may no longer satisfy the 
                      key requirement of universality, blurring the line between 
                      'differentiation' and 'selectivity'.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Until 
                      recently, the dimensions of frequency and duration were 
                      somewhat neglected within universal basic income schemes. 
                      But at the end of the 1990s, a real cleavage emerged between 
                      universal basic income proposals that provide a regular 
                      income stream, as in unconditional basic income or participation 
                      income, and schemes where beneficiaries receive a one-off 
                      payment, constituting a capital stock as in stakeholder 
                      or capital grant proposals.11 With respect to income streams, 
                      a further relevant distinction should be made with respect 
                      to the timing of regular instalments. It does make a difference 
                      whether a recipient receives the grant on a weekly, monthly 
                      or even yearly basis. Shorter intervals often draw support 
                      from those who emphasise basic security, whereas advocates 
                      of equal opportunity, suspicious of any form of paternalism, 
                      typically favour longer intervals. Of course, timing may 
                      simply be determined by the surrounding ad-ministrative 
                      time frame: until recently, wages were commonly paid in 
                      weekly instalments in the UK and Ireland as compared to 
                      the majority of European countries which employed a monthly 
                      pay system. Having basic income 'piggy-back' on whatever 
                      system is in operation at any given time often makes good 
                      administrative sense.<br>

                      the distinction between streams and stocks informs much 
                      of the current debate, the distinction is prone to overstatement. 
                      Under the right circumstances income streams can be converted 
                      into stocks and vice versa, though it remains unclear whether 
                      such condit-ions are currently present in even the most 
                      advanced welfare regimes. In addition, many of the basic 
                      capital approaches seem to have some in-built mechanisms 
                      of ensuring that the entire grant is not wasted on so-called 
                      'stakeblowing' activities. Once we take this expansion into 
                      account, the distinction between income and capital grant 
                      schemes diminishes.12<br>

                      final consideration concerns the duration aspect of basic 
                      income. Putting a time-limit upon receipt of assistance 
                      is a measure common to most selective income support policies, 
                      but could conceivably be used to render universal basic 
                      income socially and politically acceptable. A recent proposal 
                      by Stuart White argues in favour of introducing a temporary 
                      basic income scheme to combat exploitation and free-riding.13 
                      Limiting the receipt of basic income to, say, a total of 
                      five years may deflect free-riding by recipients who would 
                      otherwise take advantage of the scheme, or at the very least 
                      render its overall effect less socially damaging. In addition 
                      to these normative considerations, a time-limited basic 
                      income policy may also reflect practical considerations, 
                      such as fitting neatly with other policies that make up 
                      the institutional background of that particular welfare 
                      regime (such as child benefit or universal pension provisions).<br>

                      refers to the particular shape that a universal transfer 
                      takes. When debating basic income we commonly think about 
                      cash transfers, but certain forms of in-kind transfers (for 
                      example, food coupons, education or travel vouchers, housing 
                      benefits) should not be dismissed out of hand. The defining 
                      feature of a universal basic income scheme is not the distinction 
                      between cash or in-kind transfers as such, but rather whether 
                      social assistance takes the form of public or private goods. 
                      Universally distributed private in-kind measures such as 
                      education vouchers may be con-sidered part of a universal 
                      basic income, as opposed to strict public goods such as 
                      road infrastructure. Having said this, there are many good 
                      reasons why most universal basic income schemes will rely 
                      on cash transfers, but in principle at least part of a basic 
                      income or capital grant could be transferred in kind.<br>

                      researchers seem to appreciate fully how many distinctive 
                      forms cash transfers can take. Consider, for instance, the 
                      difference between schemes that deliver the grant by postal 
                      cheque, in the form of a debit card with automatic top-up, 
                      or as a refundable tax credit. Each of these forms has benefits 
                      and drawbacks that need to be carefully considered at the 
                      level of design and implementation. One important administrative 
                      factor is the level of integration, the ease with which 
                      a given scheme operates within the existing administrat-ive 
                      environment. Highly integrated grants make use of existing 
                      tax-and-transfer mechanisms only, whereas weakly integrated 
                      versions may require additional, often costly, administrative 
                      measures. The latter must of course be offset by the corresponding 
                      advantages: for example, higher levels of take-up of schemes 
                      that oper-ate independently of other, more selective, welfare 
                      benefits.</font></p>

                      final dimension of universal basic income schemes relates 
                      to the capacity to satisfy recipients' basic needs. Strictly 
                      speaking, a universal basic income need not be fixed at 
                      subsistence level: it can conceivably both exceed as well 
                      as fall short of what is commonly considered adequate in 
                      a given society.14<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some 
                      scholars have made the case for a partial as opposed to 
                      a full basic income, and most cognate universal schemes 
                      can be varied along this dimension. The key distinction 
                      here is between partial proposals that allow for basic income 
                      to be complemented by other types of cash or in-kind assistance, 
                      and proposals where the partial basic income becomes the 
                      sole means of social assistance. Not surprisingly, ideological 
                      positions differ considerably as to which form is most desirable. 
                      Neo-conservatives like James Buchanan, Milton Friedman or 
                      Charles Murray have all at times endorsed a welfare state 
                      that adopts a single universal scheme for social assistance, 
                      provided we simultane-ously cut all other types of state 
                      intervention. Socialists and social democrats, on the other 
                      hand, oppose such proposals and insist that a partial basic 
                      income should always be complemented by other forms of social 
                      assistance. With respect to one-off grants, things are slightly 
                      different: in this case the goal is not primarily income 
                      security but rather improving one's stock of personal assets. 
                      Typical examples of how to use a basic capital include investing 
                      in education or using the grant as start-up capital for 
                      a small business.15<br>
                      Focusing for the moment on income stream versions of universal 
                      basic income, the adequacy dimension raises a number of 
                      problems. There is first the familiar problem of defining 
                      and measuring the level of subsistence at any given time 
                      or place. There exists an immense literature on various 
                      ways of delineating basic needs in contemporary welfare 
                      societies. While most of this literature accepts that there 
                      is something arbitrary about determining a uniform level 
                      of subsistence across society, we should nevertheless appreciate 
                      that even arbitrary benchmarks often serve a useful purpose 
                      in social policy. This is not merely a matter of debating 
                      the proper criteria but also of finding ways to properly 
                      assess how differential contingencies affect people's lives.

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                      related concern is whether the level of a universal grant 
                      needs to be fixed at all. Perhaps we should take a dynamic 
                      approach by making the level of the grant periodically revisable, 
                      which could be done in two ways. First, the level of the 
                      grant can be periodically revised by Parliament or an independent 
                      commission, taking into account reflections of economic 
                      perform-ance, political will and so on. A second possibility 
                      is to link the level of the grant automatically to some 
                      macro-economic indicators, as is already the case in some 
                      European countries. This indexation approach has the clear 
                      advantage of minimising direct political interference, but 
                      it remains a question whether this is in all cases a good 
                      thing. Two further advantages of the dynamic approach, whichever 
                      form it takes, are that the resulting level of grant reflects 
                      the overall state of the economy as well as being able to 
                      respond much quicker to dynamic changes in behaviour that 
                      will inevitably occur with the introduction of a basic income. 
                      A potential downside of such a dynamic approach, however, 
                      is perhaps that it does not instil the same degree of basic 
                      security as a fixed level grant achieves, which in turn 
                      may have adverse effects at the personal as well as the 
                      social level.<br>

                      history of basic income is replete with deep-seated divisions

                      regard basic income broadly as a radical departure from 
                      welfare policy rooted in the Bismarckian or Beveridgean 
                      traditions. However, as mentioned before, this adversarial 
                      approach to policy design is increasingly inadequate because 
                      welfare policy defies simple normative and ideological opposition. 
                      The point applies to almost any kind of policy, but universal 
                      basic income is a case in point.<br>

                      income may end up serving a number of goals, not all of 
                      which are compatible or even desirable. More significantly, 
                      what Brian Barry has labelled the principled argument for 
                      basic income can only justify its broad contours, leaving 
                      detailed features, such as those discussed, undecided.16 
                      This raises a serious political problem for basic income 
                      advocates, who remain unsure which political forces to court. 
                      Each political faction on the ideological spectrum seems 
                      divided as to whether they should fully endorse basic income 
                      and, even in cases where they do, which partic-ular variant 
                      to sponsor. And even if all of this could be resolved, as 
                      we argued, practicalities associated with the implementation 
                      of basic income repeatedly interfere with neatly drawn theoretical 
                      categories, rendering a principled, adversarial approach 
                      fruitless. Taking a less antagonistic approach, we propose 
                      that the mature stage of basic income debate would be more 
                      suited to the sort of 'fuzzy' policy design that features 
                      prominently in recent policy discourse.17 <br>

                      has a number of potential advantages. First, it takes seriously 
                      the idea that policies do not simply follow from a prescriptive 
                      statement of desirable goals. It is often suggested that 
                      policy design has to contend with second-best solutions 
                      because of economic, political or administrative feasibility 
                      constraints. But this assumes that a preferred policy can 
                      be determined independently from these background constraints, 
                      which in our view does not make much sense. Because policy 
                      must necessarily fit a number of contingencies, it is inherently 
                      pragmatic and compromising in nature (even if one agrees 
                      that any policy must start from a normative argument about 
                      desirable social goals). Fuzzy design clearly welcomes the 
                      idea of basic income as a family of concrete proposals, 
                      which can be better fitted to the background circumstances 
                      at hand.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following 
                      from this, we recommend that basic income design take a 
                      bottom-up approach where circumstances dictate both constraints 
                      and opportunities, and good policy requires that policy-makers 
                      experiment with different ways of solving practical problems 
                      and achieving certain goals. The idea of basic income having 
                      many faces sits well with the rejection of 'one size fits 
                      all' approaches in public policy analysis. From a fuzzy 
                      perspective it is perfectly congruent to advoc-ate basic 
                      income in principle, while recognising that the detailed 
                      outlook of any actual proposal will be largely determined 
                      by the specific constellation of goals, constraints and 
                      opportunities. One interesting implication in the context 
                      of an emerging social Europe is that different states or 
                      welfare regimes do not need to endorse precisely the same 
                      policy in order to deliver universal welfare. Recent years 
                      have witnessed a massive literature on the difficulties 
                      of obtaining positive coordination on social measures across 
                      EU member states.18 The variety within the basic income 
                      ideal should be appreciated as one of its key advantages, 
                      allowing it to match a wide range of political limitations.<br>

                      antagonism to 'fuzzy congruence', then, has important implications 
                      for the comparative analysis of universal welfare policies. 
                      Acknowledging the many faces of basic income allows for 
                      a specific comparative approach to basic income research 
                      which need not focus on programme specifics, but instead 
                      allows for evaluating policy outcomes. To policy-makers 
                      it matters less whether a basic income is fully unconditional 
                      or incorporates a weak participation requirement, as long 
                      as both score roughly equally well on desirable goals such 
                      as combating poverty, increasing equal access to employment, 
                      supporting a variety of life-styles, etc. And even where 
                      programmes score unevenly, a comparative approach might 
                      provide good indications why this is either not desirable-maybe 
                      different countries rate competing social goals differently-or 
                      perhaps not feasible. After all, different economic, political 
                      or administrative background conditions entail different 
                      possibilities for policy implementation.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      main lesson of this article can be summarized as follows: 
                      there is no such thing as a preferred basic income scheme 
                      independent of the overall institutional and policy context. 
                      The debate concerning the best possible basic income design 
                      can only generate productive results when carried out within 
                      the rich institutional environment of case studies. It is 
                      part of the policy-making balancing act that what works 
                      here may not work over there, and what seems a good idea 
                      now might become counterproductive or obsolete at a later 
                      time. This insight should not lead to despair; instead, 
                      the crafty policy designer should wholeheartedly embrace 
                      it. 'Fuzzy' policy design paints a world in which policy 
                      reform explicitly acknowledges the many faces of basic income, 
                      and uses this feature as its main strength to further the 
                      cause of social justice across Europe and beyond.<br>

                      book originates in a project by the International Social 
                      Security Association (ISSA) looking at the close interaction 
                      between social security and labour market regulation. It 
                      has been clear to anyone interested in either area that 
                      one cannot really know how to provide properly for income 
                      security for various social groups without at the same time 
                      looking at how these groups are affected by what happens 
                      on the labour market, yet a systematic and detailed analysis 
                      of such interactions has been largely missing. Similarly, 
                      labour economists in particular have known for quite a while 
                      that one of the crucial elements affecting how individuals 
                      behave, in terms of job-seeking, expending work effort and 
                      so on, is precisely the background of social security <br>
                      arrangements on which they can draw (or not) if they ever 
                      need to. But labour economists too by and large only have 
                      a crude understanding of security systems and seem only 
                      interested in how benefits affect the reservation wage or 
                      the supply of labour etc. Policy advances in both areas, 
                      in particular the focus on activating welfare as well as 
                      the appreciation of how 'permanent austerity' (Pierson) 
                      affects policy choice, now demand that we integrate insights 
                      where possible. <br>

                      present collection explicitly aims to contribute to this 
                      enterprise, charting significant evolutions in the labour 
                      market as well as social protection systems. The book takes 
                      a comparative approach, looking at a wide variety of countries 
                      and welfare/employment regimes as well as covering an extensive 
                      set of issues. The inevitable consequence is that the book 
                      turns out to be a bit all over the place. Also, as is often 
                      the case in such volumes, the emphasis is on describing 
                      current systems in place and how they evolved using country-by-country 
                      case studies. </font></p>

                      evolved labour market and social security arrangements. 
                      Granted, comparative researchers may disagree but to this 
                      reader at least a bit more analytical rigour would have 
                      benefited the collection. Nevertheless the volume includes 
                      a number of papers that will be of great interest to basic 
                      income supporters. <br>

                      individualization of protection rights. The individualization 
                      of assistance is of course one of the core arguments in 
                      the basic income debate. <br>

                      related is Robert Salais's piece on 'Security in a Flexible 
                      Economy'. Salais suggests we now have entered a third age 
                      of social protection, characterized by a concern with choice 
                      and quality in employment as opposed to merely minimum subsistence 
                      and adequate employment levels. Of course the third age 
                      also requires a rejuvenated policy agenda which, according 
                      to Salais, should move towards broader strategies of inclusion 
                      and social participation. Such an agenda is hardly alien 
                      to the community of basic income supporters, many of whom 
                      have adopted a post-industrialist or social inclusion stance 
                      in defence of their preferred policy. <br>

                      Millar neatly reviews New Labour's welfare-to-work policy: 
                      her article serves as a reminder of the Labour Government's 
                      goals as well as some critical notes on why it hasn't delivered 
                      on its promises despite Government protestations to the 
                      contrary. Chief amongst these is a fundamental confusion 
                      in New Labour's various New Deals - to wit, that it rather 
                      indiscriminately targets everyone without a job instead 
                      of those who are really unemployed. This is not a matter 
                      of semantics as anyone who is disabled or suffers from long-term 
                      illness can testify. Here again, basic income supporters 
                      will find much of use. <br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, 
                      the only paper that explicitly mentions basic income is 
                      by Jean-Michel Belorgey. In a comprehensive review of the 
                      French experience, Bergoley charts the ways in which labour 
                      market evolutions have threatened social security. In the 
                      absence of a state guarantee to provide all (able-bodied) 
                      workers with a job, the state has a duty to provide income 
                      security instead. The question remains what form such a 
                      system should take. Belorgey first pays homage to basic 
                      income's innovative approach, only to dismiss it out of 
                      hand later on for not making economic sense and remaining 
                      ambiguous. Unfortunately the author spends too little time 
                      detailing his criticisms, so there is not much to be said 
                      in response. It seems to me, however, that Belorgey's appreciation 
                      of basic income, and in particular the way in which different 
                      proposals that fall under this label operate, is quite different 
                      from that of most basic income supporters. In short, Sarfati 
                      and Bonoli have delivered a volume which offers many interesting 
                      thoughts on the important relation between labour market 
                      regulation and social security, but it seems readers will 
                      have to surf through quite a bit of material before actually 
                      coming across something that captures the mind. And it is 
                      still a bit of a shame that basic income has not managed 
                      to impact more on a volume that deals directly with issues 
                      at its very heart. <br>

                      to the dust jacket, &quot;Michael Otsuka sets out to vindicate 
                      left-libertarianism, a political philosophy which combines 
                      stringent rights of control over one's own mind, body, and 
                      life with egalitarian rights of ownership of the world.&quot; 
                      In so doing, he creates a political philosophy more true 
                      to the ideal of self-ownership than libertarian philosophers 
                      such as Robert Nozick, and more true to the idea of society 
                      as a voluntary association than liberal egalitarian philosophers 
                      such as John Rawls. Otsuka reconsiders self-ownership and 
                      the &quot;Lockean proviso&quot; on which much of Nozick's 
                      argument against the redistribution of property rests. He 
                      presents his work as a revision of Locke, but one that is 
                      true to the voluntary spirit of Locke's treatise.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Otsuka 
                      defines &quot;robust self-ownership&quot; as &quot;in addition 
                      to having the libertarian right itself, one also has rights 
                      over enough worldly resources to ensure that one will not 
                      be forced by necessity to come to the assistance of others 
                      in a manner involving the sacrifice of one's life, limb, 
                      or labour&quot;. Nozick does not consider robust self-ownership 
                      and seems willing to sacrifice it to preserve nominal self-ownership 
                      and unrestricted rights of property ownership. He, therefore, 
                      ends up with a world in which people are much less free 
                      than Otsuka's society. <br>
                      Locke, like many other philosophers, begins with the recognition 
                      that all people have equal claim to the land and resources 
                      of the world, and argues that individuals can appropriate 
                      portions of it as long as they leave &quot;enough and as 
                      good&quot; for everyone else. If one interprets this to 
                      mean that others are no worse off than they would be in 
                      a primitive state of nature, the proviso allows great inequalities 
                      to result from the appropriation of land. But Otsuka defines 
                      an &quot;egalitarian proviso&quot; to mean that one can 
                      only appropriate resources if they leave others with the 
                      ability to acquire an equally advantageous share. Such a 
                      rule might allow inequalities, but none that follow from 
                      control of resources outside of one's own mind and body.<br>

                      basing his theory of government on the principles of robust 
                      libertarian self-ownership and the egalitarian Lockean proviso, 
                      Otsuka seeks to create a society in which all people give 
                      their actual consent to the political society in which they 
                      live, not the weak tacit consent offered by Locke nor the 
                      hypothetical consent offered by Rawls. Otsuka goes on to 
                      apply his theory to issues such as the right to punish and 
                      intergenerational equity. However, the distributive implications 
                      of these two principles will be of most interest to readers 
                      of the Citizen's Income Newsletter.<br>

                      does not discuss what practical policy would be needed to 
                      ensure that these two principles are upheld in a modern 
                      society, and he does not discuss basic income at all. He 
                      sticks instead to the hypothetical model of an agrarian 
                      society in which these principles can be attained by granting 
                      plots of land. However, a very good case for basic income 
                      could be made using these two principles. The egalitarian 
                      proviso justifies a large amount of redistribution from 
                      the wealthy to the poor, and the principle of robust libertarian 
                      self-ownership implies that redistribution should come in 
                      the form of an unconditional grant large enough to cover 
                      one's basic needs. What policy could do this other than 
                      basic income?<br>

                      certain politics courses. At times it might be a little

                      Citizenship and Welfare, Part Two with 'Issues of Difference' 
                      - meaning how one designs social policies for those facing 
                      different kinds of problems; and Part Three looking to citizenship

                      beyond.<br>

                      main themes of Part One include the needs of citizenship 
                      seen largely as a collective coalition of contractually 
                      obliged individuals who can work together to fulfil each 
                      other's needs. Welfare issues are discussed in traditional 
                      categories such as 'equality', 'need', 'desert', and the 
                      issues of universality and conditionality contrasted. Chapter 
                      Two examines the major traditions of citizenship, liberalism 
                      and the renewed contender 'civic republicanism', which seems 
                      to include communitarianism here. Chapter Three is addressed 
                      to a British audience and discusses the thinking of T.H. 
                      Marshall. The final chapter of Part One discusses Marxist 
                      challenges, the new right, and the communitarianism of Etzioni. 
                      A final brief discussion considers the policies of 'new 
                      labour', though says so little that it hardly seems worth 
                      the while.<br>

                      Two tackles poverty, what gender issues throw up for citizenship 
                      rights and welfare, and the problems of disabilities, and 
                      race or ethnicity. For some reason some people imagine that 
                      these 'issues of difference' cause problems for universal 
                      benefit schemes, which simply seems a misunderstanding of 
                      the terms of the debate, but Dwyer discusses these issues 
                      in a generally sensible and sensitive manner. <br>
                      The final part looks towards the possibility of a social 
                      Europe where citizenship and social security schemes might 
                      converge. Whilst a theoretical possibility, convergence 
                      is only likely to be towards the lowest common denominator 
                      since too much that is different is already invested in 
                      the diverse systems, unless, that is, a radical alternative 
                      - such as a Basic or Citizen's Income - can be instituted 
                      throughout Europe. The final chapter considers globalization.

                      shows how the choice of countries studied determines the 
                      theory of welfare state transformation which emerges. All 
                      European economies have experienced globalisation (involving 
                      lower trade barriers, liberalised financial markets, global 
                      competition, and downward pressure on tax rates), but their 
                      welfare states have reacted in different ways. Finland and 
                      Sweden have developed 'encompassing' or 'institutional' 
                      welfare states, and these have adapted to globalisation 
                      and economic crises by taking on 'liberal' (or residualist) 
                      and 'conservative' (earnings-related insurance-based) characteristics 
                      in order to retain their basically institutional character 
                      - i.e., they have taken on characteristics long-established 
                      in Anglo-Saxon welfare states (such as that in the UK) and 
                      in Bismarckian systems (such as that in Germany) in order 
                      to remain 'encompassing' structures. In particular, greater 
                      reliance on means-tested benefits of last resort (which 
                      characterise social security provision in the UK), higher 
                      employees' (rather than employers') contributions, and greater 
                      reliance on private insurance (which mirror recent changes 
                      in the German and French insurance-based systems) have enabled 
                      the basic structure of the Scandinavian welfare states (characterised 
                      by universal pensions and by sickness and unemployment benefits 
                      to which employers make considerable contributions) to survive.

                      on globalization and other outside pressures which have 
                      triggered welfare state restructuring, on political parties 
                      and interest groups, on power resources at work, on restructuring 
                      of public health and social services, and on the greater 
                      reliance on means-tested benefits, lead to the conclusion 
                      that particular stabilising forces (such as Trades Unions 
                      and employers' organisations) and a structure which gave 
                      to all Scandinavian population groups an incentive to contribute 
                      to the system when it was built, have resulted in increased 
                      public approval of the system during a recession, rather 
                      than the kind of unwillingness to finance the welfare state 
                      which the UK has experienced. As Timonen puts it, &quot;in 
                      a game of politics against markets, politics scored another 
                      victory&quot; (p.17).<br>

                      particular interest to those interested in social security 
                      reform is chapter 7. During the recession of the 1990s pensions 
                      ceased to be universal in Sweden and became earnings-related 
                      and means-tested, and some other benefits became more tightly 
                      work-related. As Timonen sees it, no particular organised 
                      groups were defending universal benefits - but that doesn't 
                      mean a permanent slide away from universal and towards means-tested 
                      benefits, because the median voter is likely to favour universal 
                      benefits. It is interesting that Sweden's child benefit 
                      has remained universal, as has the UK's. As Timonen suggests, 
                      <br>
                      &quot;child benefits could have been taken away from high-earning 
                      families, but this option was not seriously considered at 
                      any time during the 1990s, partly because the resulting 
                      reduction in expenditure would not have been significant 
                      but more importantly because it would have undermined the 
                      support and legitimacy of the system as a whole&quot; (p.180).<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                      book suggests that means-tested benefits will re-main important 
                      but also that problems of means-testing are understood and 
                      that there are parts of the benefits system where means-testing 
                      doesn't belong - and this seems to be particularly true 
                      of benefits for children.<br>
                      The author suggests that we ought to expect that universal 
                      benefits in general will be more popular and thus better-defended 
                      than means-tested ones because everyone receives universal 
                      benefits but not everyone receives means-tested benefits 
                      - but this isn't what happens, except in relation to public 
                      services which benefit or potentially benefit everybody 
                      substantially (such as litter collection), because for increasing 
                      numbers the value of universal benefits is negligible so 
                      they wish to see as little of their taxes spent on benefits 
                      as possible - hence the drive towards means-testing.<br>

                      why has universal child benefit survived? If a benefit structure's 
                      survival is merely the result of an emotional reflex, then 
                      the future of universal benefits might look bleak - unless, 
                      of course, organised interest groups argue for them.</font><br>

                      report assesses the progress made in the reduction of poverty 
                      during the six years since 1997 and asks whether the same 
                      reduction would have occurred if the policy changes made 
                      during those years had not been made. Using a definition 
                      of poverty of 'income below 60% of the median income', the 
                      authors model policy changes and conclude that if there 
                      had been no changes to direct tax or benefits then poverty 
                      would have been higher for children by 62% if income means 
                      'income before housing costs' but only by 38% if income 
                      means 'income after housing costs'. For pensions poverty 
                      would have been higher by 53% based on income before housing 
                      costs and by 129% based on income after housing costs. The 
                      Government's tax and benefit policy changes are calculated 
                      to have removed 1.3m children from poverty.<br>

                      problem is that household expenditure data is only available 
                      about two years after the event, and because a variety of 
                      labour market, earned income, family com-position and other 
                      factors can change considerably over six years, the actual 
                      change in poverty levels cannot easily be estimated. The 
                      researchers estimate that the actual number of children 
                      taken out of poverty will be about 1m and that the Government 
                      will therefore have met its target of reducing child poverty 
                      by 25% by 2004. <br>

                      to the future, the authors conclude that, if employment 
                      levels are maintained, and if benefits and tax credits keep 
                      up with median income, then poverty levels will not rise 
                      - but the fact that Income Support rates remain well below 
                      the Government's own definition of poverty will mean that 
                      some sections of the population cannot be lifted out of 
                      poverty.<br>

                      problem with the Government's definition of poverty is that 
                      if earned incomes rise then the median (and mean) income 
                      rises and the poverty line rises, meaning that tax and benefit 
                      changes are needed simply to stop poverty levels rising. 
                      Thus &quot;more redistribution will be needed each year 
                      simply to maintain the progress which has been made.&quot; 
                      This means that &quot;further reductions in child poverty 
                      are likely to be increasingly difficult to achieve&quot;

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
                      the period under review, Tax Credits entered the landscape. 
                      These have not only affected income calculations but will 
                      also have had labour market behavioural effects which in 
                      turn will have had an effect on incomes. If it proves possible 
                      to use household expenditure data to isolate these effects 
                      then it will be interesting to see how significant they 
                      are. Equally interesting would be predictions of future 
                      poverty levels based on further changes to the structure 
                      of tax and benefits rather than simply on changes in rates 
                      within the current system.<br>
