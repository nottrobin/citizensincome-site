                      complexity of a tax and benefits system, the greater the 
                      likelihood that mistakes will be made; and, as computer 
                      companies and civil servants are discovering, the greater 
                      the complexity of a system the greater the difficulties 
                      of computerising it - leading, we believe, to software developers

                      Royston of the <b>Department for Work and Pensions Simplification 
                      Unit</b> is inviting advice agencies to tell her how things 
                      could be made easier for clients: 'We believe complexity 
                      matters because it may prevent customers getting the benefits 
                      to which they are entitled. It may lead to errors both by 
                      staff in administering the benefit and by customers in not 
                      being clear what they need to report. It makes the system 
                      time consuming and therefore costly to administer. The benefits 
                      system has become complex because of the wish to ensure 
                      fairness for customers whose circumstances may be complicated; 
                      the desire to maximise the use of limited resources and 
                      the need to safeguard the system against fraud and abuse. 
                      In addition, over time, a multitude of small and large scale 
                      changes have been introduced which have interacted and overlapped 
                      with existing provisions to cause further complexity, which 
                      can be difficult for staff and customers alike to navigate 
                      their way around. The introduction of the Tax Credit System 
                      and the way it interacts with existing benefits has added 
                      a whole new layer of complexity for customers and staff. 
                      There are, however, things which can be done to reduce complexity 
                      and the unit have been asked to look at what can be achieved 
                      in the current year.'</font> </p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      <b>'Community Care' website</b> (on 22nd June 2006) reports 
                      that measures to help people into work have the opposite 
                      effect: It suggests that 'there is a carrot-and-stick approach 
                      to moving people off benefits. The carrots are tax credits, 
                      national minimum wage, benefit 'run-ons', special rules 
                      for disregarding earnings and so on. The sticks are just 
                      as numerous: tighter rules on proving that you are looking 
                      for work or establishing you are genuinely sick; penalties 
                      for turning work down; greater policing of the claimant's 
                      out-of-work activity.' Particularly problematic is the 'rule 
                      that limits unemployed claimants to studying fewer than 
                      16 hours a week even if the course they want to do would 
                      subsequently increase their employability. This rule has 
                      been belatedly recognised as a barrier to employment. From 
                      September, in &#133;.. pilot areas, low-skilled unemployed 
                      people will be able to attend full-time training and retain 
                      their Jobseeker's Allowance. The site cites the example 
                      of a carer with a partner with disabilities who finds herself 
                      no better off employed for 15 hours per week than when employed 
                      for 4 hours per week, and worse off if they are employed 
                      for 20 hours per week than if they are employed for 4 hours 
                      per week. The article concludes: 'There is something wrong 
                      with a benefit system that is so complicated that it's difficult 
                      for people to make informed choices about what work they 
                      can safely undertake and not be worse off. And these are 
                      issues that must be addressed.'</font></p>

                      <b>Institute for Fiscal Studies </b>has discovered that 
                      when household spending, rather than income, is used to 
                      measure living standards, relative poverty in Britain has 
                      risen, rather than fallen, since 1997. The study, funded 
                      by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, suggests that a useful 
                      alternative definition of relative poverty would be living 
                      in a household which spends less than 60% of the median-spending 
                      household, rather than the measure most frequently used 
                      by the government, which is to be living in a household 
                      whose income is less than 60% of the median-income household. 
                      Using this alternative measure, the study finds that the 
                      rate of child poverty based on household spending rose by 
                      11 per cent between 1996/97 and 2002/03, whereas the measure 
                      of child poverty targeted by the Government, based on income,

                      on a research project by Professor Jane Millar (in The Edge, 
                      issue 22, July 2006, p.31) which shows that non-poor low-paid 
                      employees have less chance of staying out of poverty during 
                      the following year than non-poor employees in general (91% 
                      as opposed to 96%), and that 'tax credits and in-work benefits 
                      play an important role in keeping some low-paid people out 
                      of poverty, but are associated with a lower probability 
                      of avoiding poverty over time.' As Professor Millar writes, 
                      'preliminary analysis of our data suggests the need to question 
                      the sustainability of relying too heavily on this type of 
                      fiscal strategy in preventing poverty over the longer term.'</font></p>

                      <b>Norwegian research project</b> has reported that being 
                      in contact with the needs testing part of the welfare state 
                      reduces levels of interpersonal trust but universal welfare 
                      arrangements increase them. The researchers conclude: 'If 
                      it is the case that social capital as trust is an asset 
                      both for individuals and for society as a whole, interpersonal 
                      trust should ideally be cultivated, so also by the welfare 
                      state. From a policy point of view, one solution to develop 
                      trust, or at least not break it down, may thus be to restructure 
                      parts of the system of social assistance. In line with the 
                      results from this study, this may be possible by developing 
                      the universality of the welfare system as opposed to making 
                      it even more discretionary' (Christer Hyggen, 'Risks and

                      earned incomes. The problem is compounded by the complexity

                      the 'depth' of the poverty trap we mean the extent of the 
                      marginal deduction rate, i.e., the rate at which income 
                      is withdrawn for any particular level of earned income. 
                      So, to take the example below, a lone parent who is a private 
                      tenant and who has one child under 11 experiences a marginal 
                      deduction rate of 89.5% for any earned income within the 
                      range &pound;134.33 to &pound;392.66. By the 'breadth' of 
                      the poverty trap we mean the spectrum of earned incomes 
                      for which there is a high marginal deduction rate: so here 
                      the breadth of the poverty trap is defined by an earned 
                      income of &pound;392.66 per week. <br>

                      over 60% on gross earnings at least up to &pound;300 per

                      This is because Child Benefit is paid unconditionally, so 
                      to increase it is to reduce child poverty because 1) it 
                      increases the net income of families with children, and 
                      2) it reduces the marginal deduction rates for families

                      Citizen's Income (CI) is 'an unconditional, non-withdrawable 
                      income payable to each individual as a right of citizenship' 
                      (Citizen's Income Trust strapline). Within that definition 
                      a wide variety of options are possible in terms of how large 
                      the income might be and how it might be paid for. Most of 
                      the research and debate which the Citizen's Income Trust 
                      has undertaken or sponsored has been based on the premise 
                      that only a small Citizen's Income is politically feasible 
                      in the short- to medium-term and that only revenue-neutral 
                      schemes funded by something like existing tax rates are 
                      likely to be considered (i.e., schemes entirely paid for 
                      by reducing tax allowances, means-tested benefits and National 
                      Insurance benefits and by leaving income tax rates at somewhere 
                      near their current level) - though this presupposition has 
                      been somewhat dented recently by the Irish Government's 
                      willingness to consider a sizeable Citizen's Income paid 
                      for by substantially increasing tax rates (Department of 
                      the Taoiseach, 2002). An adult Citizen's Income of &euro;109 
                      per week is envisaged, paid for by a single tax rate of 
                      47.14% (Anne Miller, 2003). And the Citizen's Income Trust 
                      is itself about to publish a persuasive paper which shows 
                      that a Citizen's Income paid at &pound;90 for each adult 
                      might be feasible.<br>

                      the debate about how large a Citizen's Income would be is 
                      a secondary matter. What matters is the structure: its unconditionality, 
                      its nonwithdrawability, and its payment to individuals rather 
                      than to households; and it is this structure which creates 
                      its effect, which makes it attractive to people with a variety 
                      of political outlooks, and which gives it its close relationship 
                      with notions of citizenship.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because 
                      the Citizen's Income is not withdrawn as earnings rise, 
                      a large CI would mean that net income would rise steadily 
                      for the poorest families as earned income rises, and a small 
                      CI would mean that for those families still on means-tested 
                      benefits net income would rise more rapidly than it does 
                      now.<br>
                      For Britain's many flexible workers, a Citizen's Income 
                      would provide a measure of security on which they could 
                      build. Part-time work and self-employment would become more 
                      attractive, allowing people to develop more flexible patterns 
                      of working more consistent with their own and their children's 
                      or other dependents' needs. Thus consistently high levels 
                      of employment can be expected.<br>

                      income is redistributed from people in the higher income

                      low percentage decreases for those in the higher deciles. 
                      This kind of redistribution will not affect the lifestyles 
                      of the wealthy overmuch, it will leave middle-income individuals

                      and it will considerably increase the incomes of the poorest 
                      section of the community - and it achieves this while not 
                      deepening the poverty or unemployment traps. Because every 
                      individual and household will receive a greater proportion 
                      of their income as non-withdrawable cash payments, those 
                      in the lower earnings deciles will experience lower withdrawal 
                      rates and thus a greater incentive to increase their earned

                      main argument of this wide ranging, interdisciplinary and 
                      well-researched book is that if the economy were to be in 
                      a state of long-run full employment, and if everyone had 
                      equal earning capacities, then there would be no need for 
                      a Citizen's Income (here called 'basic income' (BI) or 'universal 
                      basic income' (UBI)). However, in situations of structural 
                      unemployment and nonequal earning-powers, compensatory justice 
                      is best served by a BI.<br>

                      introductory chapter by Philippe Van Parijs defines a BI 
                      as an 'income paid by a government at a uniform level and 
                      at regular intervals, to each adult member of society' (p.12) 
                      and compares it with other policy instruments, and particularly 
                      with a Negative Income Tax which, while similar to a BI, 
                      is based on the household rather than the individual, is 
                      paid after tax returns are submitted and thus risks poverty 
                      during the previous year, and contributes to the financial 
                      uncertainty experienced by someone unemployed and faced 
                      with a job offer. Van Parijs goes on to argue for a BI on 
                      the basis of a 'real freedom' notion of justice, and in

                      first chapter compares the increasing conditionality of 
                      social security benefits with a BI, and answers the objection 
                      to a BI that it damages self-reliance, reciprocity and the 
                      work ethic by showing that in some ways they might increase 
                      with a BI. <br>
                      The second chapter suggests that some parasitism is a price 
                      worth paying for the compensatory justice which a BI would 
                      promote. This chapter also contains a careful critique of 
                      three understandings of 'compensatory justice'. It shows 
                      that raising means-tested benefits and increasing the minimum 
                      wage increases unemployment and thus has a detrimental effect 
                      on compensatory justice, and that a BI would improve compensatory 
                      justice because workers would be more able to turn down 
                      jobs which did not offer pay which compensated sufficiently 
                      for the disadvantages of the job.<br>

                      chapter 3 the author understands the voluntary non-work 
                      option as a giving up of job rights in return for a BI; 
                      and in chapter 4 he discusses a possible BI experiment (discussed 
                      in the Citizen's Income Newsletter, issue 2 for 2005, pp.5ff) 
                      - because only in this way shall we be able to evaluate 
                      a BI's effects. The limitations and results of Negative 
                      Income Tax and other similar experiments are discussed, 
                      and an experiment to discover the behavioural responses 
                      to a BI is described.<br>
                      The final chapter outlines the steps which could be taken 
                      to implement a BI scheme: steps which would begin to have

                      book is generally clear and well-argued, though two issues 
                      might have been given rather clearer treatment: 1. A Negative 
                      Income Tax could indeed have the same net income effect 
                      as a BI, but given the problems which Van Parijs finds with 
                      it (the household base, delayed payment, and financial uncertainty 
                      when faced with a job offer - and other problems might have 
                      been mentioned, such as administrative complexity), it is 
                      difficult to see why this option is given the prominent 
                      treatment it gets throughout the book; and 2. Both 'work' 
                      and 'employment' are used to mean 'paid work', whereas 'work' 
                      should properly encompass both paid and unpaid family, community 
                      and artistic work. (Writing this book review is work, but 
                      it's not paid work). <br>

                      see a Basic Income (BI) as facilitating an efficient market 
                      economy, 'allowing for greater labour market flexibility 
                      and making for a society of greater individualism and economic 
                      rationality' (pp.xiii-xiv) and those who believe that a 
                      BI 'must be part of an egalitarian strategy, not to be seen

                      the Basic Income of the Foreword is only one possible example 
                      of the Basic Income Guarantee (BIG) which the book and USBIG 
                      are about, as a BIG is defined as 'a public policy that 
                      unconditionally ensures that the income of every citizen 
                      reaches some minimum level. Its guarantee is unconditional 
                      in the sense that every citizen receives it without any 
                      obligation to work, to have children, to get married, or 
                      to perform any socially mandated task' (p.1). The problem 
                      with this definition is that both a Citizen's Income and 
                      the UK's means-tested Pension Credit and Income Support 
                      can fit into it and that 'basic income guarantee' can either 
                      mean that an unconditional equal income is paid to all citizens 
                      or that the State ensures that no-one's income falls below 
                      a certain level. These are very different ideas. When the 
                      editors list the possibilities they have in mind (negative 
                      income tax (NIT), BI and Basic Capital (BC)) they omit the 
                      means-tested options, suggesting that the definition on 
                      p.1 should read 'a public policy which by some means or 
                      other pays to every citizen an income the amount of which 
                      is not affected by the citizen's other income' (a definition 
                      which with a small stretch of its literal meaning can include 
                      NIT by counting an income tax allowance as a cash payment).<br>

                      2 revisits the Speenhamland experiment of 1795, finds that 
                      'while it is theoretically possible that a floor under incomes 
                      would be transformed into a ceiling, this certainly did 
                      not happen during the Speenhamland period, and there is 
                      little evidence that it has ever happened' (p.43), and concludes 
                      that 'if an income guarantee were in place, employers would 
                      become even more cautious about imposing wage cuts' (p.43) 
                      - but only, of course, if such an income guarantee were 
                      non-means-tested. Chapter 3 discusses the idea of a capital 
                      endowment paid for by inheritance tax; and chapter 4 the 
                      recent history of American income maintenance policy: the

                      Tax Credit (EITC) and workfare. Chapter 5 returns to US 
                      NIT experiments, in which work disincentive effects were 
                      found to be interestingly small (though the press at the 
                      time treated the existence of any such effect as serious)

                      has made a BI unnecessary (though the conclusions are about 
                      lack of evidence for a link between short- and long-run

                      is a highly detailed report on a research project at the 
                      University of York on the non-take-up of social security 
                      benefits by older people who are entitled to them, and in 
                      particular of the means-tested Minimum Income Guarantee 
                      (MIG) (now replaced by Pension Credit). As the author suggests, 
                      the MIG was in fact far from 'guaranteed', as to receive 
                      it pensioners needed to claim it. This is no minor issue, 
                      for Pension Credit shares many of the MIG's characteristics 
                      and five million people are entitled to it (p.2).<br>
                      Dornan lists the negative aspects of means-testing: 'complexity, 
                      fraud, stigma, moral hazard and incomplete take-up' (p.3). 
                      Given that both major political parties now regard means-testing 
                      as the foundation of income-maintenance policy, these negative 
                      aspects matter - and in the context of pension provision, 
                      low take-up of the Pension Credit will compromise the ability 
                      of other parts of the government's pensions plan to ensure 
                      income security in old age.<br>
                      An introductory chapter is followed by a review of existing 
                      research on take-up. The finding is that previous studies 
                      have concluded that levels of non-take-up relate to the 
                      costs of claiming and that the most important factor is 
                      that pensioners simply don't understand the system. This 
                      means that 'the trade off between costs and benefits is 
                      not an informed rational process' (p.35). <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chapter 
                      3 studies the pensioner population in order to understand 
                      factors which lead people not to claim benefits to which 
                      they are entitled. Dornan finds that increasing numbers 
                      are reliant on the means-tested safety net, many with small 
                      entitlements - and these are the people least likely to 
                      claim. He also finds that the oldest claimants are likely 
                      to be the most isolated and therefore, even if entitled 
                      to substantial amounts of MIG, the most likely to find it 
                      difficult to negotiate the claiming process. <br>
                      Chapter 4 discusses the Pensions Green Paper, Partnership 
                      in Pensions, to which the means-tested Pension Credit remains 
                      central, and also the alternative of a simpler non-means-tested 
                      system; chapter 5 describes the modeling techniques used 
                      in the research project; chapter 6 provides a longitudinal 
                      perspective (which shows receipt of means-tested pension 
                      benefits to be more volatile than one might expect); and 
                      chapter 7 explores the impact of additional income on consumption.<br>
                      A concluding chapter suggests that, if means-tested provision 
                      is to remain at the heart of government policy, then methods 
                      must be employed to ensure greater take-up, and particularly 
                      a more proactive approach by the Department for Work and 
                      Pensions; but, as Dornan suggests, 'if a radical solution 
                      such as the Citizen's Pension were to be used, solving non-take

                      that extending entitlement to the Basic State Pension and 
                      increasing its value would reduce the number of pensioners 
                      on means-tested benefits and would thus reduce the problem

                      inclusive and realistic understanding of state welfare arrangements' 
                      (p.1), because 'to fully appreciate and understand the nature 
                      of social security measures the debate must progress beyond 
                      the realms of determining an efficient allocation of resources 
                      and incorporate questions of social justice, citizenship

                      presuppositions because they limit the policy options we

                      and has interesting things to say both about social construction

                      and chapter 3 pursues McKay's preference for seeing transfers 
                      as promoting 'social security' rather than serving 'income 
                      maintenance', with 'social security' understood as 'an ideological 
                      objective to provide and/or promote an environment where

                      4 provides a brief history of social security policy in 
                      Britain and a description of New Labour's 'welfare to work' 
                      strategy. The author also notes trends towards increasing 
                      means-testing and the associated emphasis on households 
                      rather than individuals. McKay documents the feminization 
                      of poverty through women's labour market participation being 
                      concentrated in occupations which lend themselves to part-time 
                      and casual employment, and she discusses social exclusion 
                      as an effect of poverty. She concludes that what is required 
                      is 'a policy that is independent of traditional labour market 
                      processes but which will operate in such a way that does 
                      not adversely affect the efficient functioning of the waged 
                      economy' and that 'a CBI presents as a possible remedy to 
                      the related, but yet distinct, problems of poverty and social 
                      exclusion and that positively responds to the dynamics of 
                      modern living conditions' (p.102).<br>

                      5 defines a CBI, discusses its possible effects on existing 
                      patterns of work (i.e., paid work), and argues that it would 
                      meet the needs of a modern flexible labour market and particularly 
                      of women's needs within such a labour market.<br>
                      Rather less satisfactory is chapter 6, which treats 'minimum 
                      income guarantee', 'social dividend', Juliet Rhys Williams' 
                      work-tested scheme and Negative Income Tax as 'variations 
                      of a CBI' (p.181) and then regards them as elements of the 
                      history of CBI understood as a 'reform proposal' (p.181). 
                      McKay's case would have been better served by regarding 
                      CBI as sufficiently different from these 'variations' to 
                      enable the debate to leave behind the dominant mind-set 
                      which has informed arguments for the 'variations'.<br>

                      7 shows that many arguments for a CBI are rather less than 
                      radical (and here the argument would have been clearer if 
                      the author had recognized that a partial CBI is still a 
                      CBI and not a 'modification'); and chapter 8 develops more 
                      radical arguments based on a feminist economics perspective. 
                      The main argument here is that 'work' encompasses a wide 
                      range of activity, both paid and unpaid, both individual 
                      and corporate, and that a CBI, by disconnecting work and 
                      income, would enable us to value unpaid work more highly. 
                      (While 'work is defined broadly at the beginning of this 
                      chapter, it is still sometimes used with the meaning 'paid 
                      work' and so ought to have been replaced by that term).

                      7 to 11 discuss different forms of citizens' stakes: capital 
                      grants for children (such as the CTF); use-restricted capital 
                      grants (e.g. for higher education); capital grants for parents; 
                      care accounts (for anyone with caring responsibilities); 
                      and time assets (a 'time' account into which employees can

                      paid leave). <br>
                      In the concluding chapter the editors employ 'social investment', 
                      'libertarian', 'post-productivist' and 'egalitarian' perspectives 
                      to evaluate the citizen's stake idea, and they also discuss 
                      social policy and policy debate in other countries. They 
                      argue that support for the CTF is grounded in egalitarianism, 
                      and that therefore every child's fund should have the same 
                      amount in it when they reach age 18. At the moment a family 
                      which can afford to pay into the fund can create a fund 
                      of &pound;31,580 whereas a family which can't will leave 
                      their child with only &pound;2,300. Unfortunately, the remedies 
                      recommended rely on means-testing or bureaucratic discretion 
                      rather than on simply isolating the account from additional 
                      saving.<br>

                      stake is likely to become more embedded in popular thinking'

                      such a successful policy we might have seen more examples

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      authors focus their study on the impact of the current processes 
                      of structural transformation of European welfare states 
                      on work and family. To conduct their analysis they employ 
                      a familiar triangular theoretical framework that conceives 
                      of welfare regimes as mixes between state, market and civil 
                      society. Denmark, Sweden, Germany, France and the United 
                      Kingdom are taken as representatives of different welfare 
                      mixes and both quantitative and qualitative data are used 
                      to examine recent changes and discuss future trends.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                      are three main topics framing the several comparative perspectives 
                      presented in the book. The first is the change in the pattern 
                      of labour market participation, with increased participation 
                      by women and a steady reduction of the number of households 
                      where there is only one person, usually male, integrated 
                      in the formal workforce. The authors also assume that the 
                      'mixed economy of welfare' can be identified as 'the new 
                      overall consensus on the future of welfare administration 
                      in Europe' (p. 2) thereby mostly relieving their analysis 
                      of the task of dealing with alternative normative perspectives 
                      that might take issue with that assumption. The third topic 
                      framing the analysis is the set of fiscal constraints deriving 
                      from monetary integration and their implications as external 
                      pressures for the future of the welfare state. Throughout 
                      the book, the authors attempt to ascertain what these three 
                      issues mean for different welfare regimes in contemporary 
                      Europe.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      authors' discussion of different welfare models is heavily 
                      based on the mixed economy and the triangular perspective 
                      mentioned above. It is also focused, as one would expect, 
                      on differences in terms of work and family policies. Ultimately, 
                      the authors choose to use four variants: a 'parental welfare 
                      model' associated with France, a 'male breadwinner model' 
                      associated with Germany (these two being subdivisions of 
                      the more standard corporatist model), a 'residual poverty 
                      oriented welfare model' exemplified by the United Kingdom 
                      and a 'municipal social service state' associated with Denmark 
                      and Sweden. While the reasons laid out for drawing distinctions 
                      between the selected welfare regimes are relevant, one does 
                      wonder if it wouldn't be more straightforward just to assume 
                      that the study is a comparative analysis of five specific 
                      countries. As it stands, the categorical models that are 
                      presented tend to appear as a posteriori constructions built 
                      to fit the set of previously selected countries included 
                      in the study. One could of course argue that all typologies 
                      in the 'welfare modelling business' necessarily fit to some 
                      extent under the previous description. However, the usefulness 
                      of such modelling rests to a large extent on providing us 
                      with a better understanding of similarities and differences 
                      between different groups of welfare regimes along specified 
                      dimensions. If the models in question are so specific that 
                      they only fit one or a very small number of similar countries 
                      the usefulness of such a typology certainly isn't clear.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      terms of methodology, aggregate data mainly from EU and 
                      OECD sources is used for comparing the regimes at the macro 
                      level. The core of the analysis however relies on qualitative 
                      data (and some specific quantitative data) obtained through 
                      interviews of a limited sample of low-income and middle-class 
                      households from average sized cities in Denmark, Sweden, 
                      Germany, France and the United Kingdom (making for a total 
                      of ten European neighbourhoods). The information from these 
                      interviews is more illustrative than representative given 
                      the sampling risks (recognized by the authors) associated 
                      with such specific data collection efforts. It therefore 
                      seems questionable for the authors to allow themselves to 
                      draw general conclusions such as that '[their] interviews 
                      (&#133;) show that the combined effort of state economic 
                      support as a safety net is very important' (p. 202). Still, 
                      the qualitative information provided is of much greater 
                      depth than would have been possible by using only data available 
                      at the national level and as such it constitutes an interesting 
                      effort, as long as proper caution is exercised in deriving 
                      conclusions from such material.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
                      relevant aspect of the book is the authors' wish to accommodate 
                      feminist concerns and criticisms that permeate the analysis 
                      of the relation of social citizenship with family and work 
                      patterns. The main emphasis is on women's increased participation 
                      in the labour force and its implications for family and 
                      child care structures and policies. Taking the lead from 
                      mainstream feminist scholars, the authors assume that the 
                      goal of gender equality is a desirable one and proceed to 
                      discuss what arrangements in labour markets and welfare 
                      systems are more likely to produce that result. Since the 
                      authors in fact argue for more flexible arrangements in 
                      both the labour and welfare arenas (p. 138) perhaps individual 
                      autonomy would be a better way to describe their goal than 
                      gender equality. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
                      the crucial importance of family and social networks is 
                      often mentioned, the potentially disruptive effects of modern 
                      welfare systems on those institutions are not discussed. 
                      Since, even in the context of strong state economic assistance, 
                      family support is generally regarded as crucial, it would 
                      be advisable to take into account the possible negative 
                      effects of welfare policies in terms of incentives and family 
                      cohesion (or at the very least argue why this isn't a relevant 
                      concern). Perhaps the fact that the analysis is largely 
                      descriptive and based on the family's perspectives (as expressed 
                      in the interviews) can account for this analytical gap, 
                      but the fact is that these concerns remain unaddressed throughout 
                      the book. This is by no means a deficiency exclusive to 
                      this book as so much of the contemporary literature on welfare 
                      regimes appears to rely almost exclusively on measurement 
                      and descriptive techniques. It is nevertheless a trend to 
                      be regretted. Focusing almost exclusively on quantitative 
                      and qualitative depictions may help us to get a better structural 
                      picture of society but it will do little to contribute actively 
                      to our understanding of those structures. <br>

                      some shortcomings, Welfare and Families in Europe will be 
                      of interest to all those wishing to get an account of the 
                      recent evolution and relation between work and family in 
                      the five welfare regimes analysed. Although no Citizen's 
                      Income proposals are considered in depth, the book contains 
                      some findings that may be of interest to that discussion, 
                      particularly regarding the cases of mature industrialized

                      in Central and Northern Europe, such as that most families
