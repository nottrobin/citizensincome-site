                      to 2005</i>, Danny Dorling et al find that already wealthy 
                      areas have become disproportionately wealthier and that 
                      there is evidence of increasing polarization, with both 
                      poor and wealthy households becoming more geographically

                      their report <i>Public attitudes to economic inequality</i> 
                      Michael Orton and Karen Rowlingson reveal substantial public 
                      disquiet about growing levels of inequality, and particular 
                      unease about the levels of higher incomes. They also find 
                      a contradiction: fewer people support redistribution than 
                      see the income and wealth gaps as too wide. This suggests 
                      that, rather than redistributing income and wealth, we need 
                      to find a different way of distributing them in the first 
                      place. <br>
                      A Citizen's Income funded by a carbon tax would be such 
                      an appropriate initial distribution as the revenue would 
                      be raised from energy producers and the payment made equally 
                      to every citizen. The Citizen's Income would provide a higher 
                      proportionate net income increase for poorer households 
                      than for wealthier ones and would therefore redress both 
                      income inequality overall and, by reducing the number of 
                      poor households and increasing the number of average income 
                      households, would reduce the geographical segregation of 
                      poor and wealthy households.<br>

                      provides a graphic expression of the reason. The only conclusion 
                      to draw is that only by removing poor families, and particularly 
                      lone parent families, from means-tested benefits and tax 
                      credits, shall we be able to provide them with the necessary

                      of 50% for high earners, reckoning that higher than 40% 
                      will impose a disincentive effect. A little consistency

                      <b>Institute for Public Policy Research</b> has published 
                      its report <i>It's All About You: Citizen-centred welfare</i> 
                      (edited by Jim Bennett and Graeme Cooke, September 2007) 
                      (available at <a href="www.ippr.org/publicationsandreports.html">www.ippr.org/publicationsandreports</a>). 
                      'We propose moving towards a single income replacement benefit 
                      for people of working age. The benefit would be based on 
                      a single set of rules, paid at a standard basic rate and 
                      remain the same over time (so there would be no higher, 
                      long-term rates). It would replace Jobseeker's Allowance 
                      (JSA), Incapacity Benefit (IB) and Income Support (IS) and 
                      could also incorporate Carer's Allowance. There are a range 
                      of advantages to this proposal and they deal with some of 
                      the problems of the current benefits (and particularly the 
                      links between them). &#133; The problems associated with 
                      moving between benefits would disappear. There would be 
                      no risk to a person's benefit if they tried going to work 
                      because the benefit would be the same before and after a 
                      period in work. Importantly, there would be no financial 
                      gain to be made from claiming one benefit over another or 
                      from remaining in receipt of benefit for a long period.' 
                      The system would be simple to administer and easy to understand, 
                      and it would reduce stigma. The report suggests that the 
                      individual and not the household should be the benefit unit, 
                      and that a non-means-tested benefit should be paid for 12 
                      weeks and a means-tested benefit thereafter.<br>

                      <b>Institute for Fiscal Studies</b> has published a report, 
                      <i>Pensioner Poverty over the Next Decade: What Role for 
                      Tax and Benefit Reform? </i>By simulating the future pensioner 
                      population and its known and likely sources of income, the 
                      researchers find that generally incomes of people over 65 
                      will rise, with most of the growth coming from employment 
                      income as people remain in the labour market for longer. 
                      The report recommends that the Basic State Pension should 
                      be made universal as this would reduce pensioner poverty

                      <b>Joseph Rowntree Foundation</b> has published two reports 
                      on similar themes. <i>Lone parents and 'mini-jobs'</i>, 
                      by Kate Bell, Mike Brewer and David Phillips, finds that 
                      2.5m people have 'mini-jobs' of less than 16 hours per week, 
                      but that the financial incentives for lone parents to work 
                      in mini-jobs are weak. The authors suggest that the amount 
                      that lone parents can earn before benefits are withdrawn 
                      should be increased. This would 'encourage almost all lone 
                      parents to do mini-jobs, and many to work in jobs with longer 
                      hours. It would particularly benefit lone parents with the 
                      weakest incentives to earn and those on the lowest incomes'.

                      by Yekaterina Chzhen and Sue Middleton, finds that 'the 
                      estimated employment rates of lone parents who were receiving 
                      child tax credit were around 11 percentage points lower 
                      than those of eligible non-recipients with similar characteristics; 
                      the employment rate of mothers in couple families (i.e. 
                      with partners) who were getting child tax credit was 8 percentage 
                      points lower, on average, than that of comparable non-recipients; 
                      child tax credit decreased the probability of moving into 
                      work for women who had not been working in 2002-03 and were 
                      not in receipt of working tax credit ... ; lone parents 
                      receiving working tax credit worked around four hours fewer, 
                      on average, than comparable non-recipients'. (Quotations

                      hours worked to spend more time with their children, but 
                      do not because they cannot afford to take a pay cut, or

                      26 and 27 October, the Centre for the Study of Social Justice 
                      at Oxford University (with support from the Department of 
                      Politics and International Relations and the Public Policy 
                      Unit at Oxford as well as the Association for Legal and 
                      Social Philosophy) held a two-day conference on basic income. 
                      The conference brought together an audience of 15 invited 
                      speakers and 60 delegates to discuss a number of issues 
                      surrounding the idea of 'the basic income society'. The 
                      organizers of this conference, David Casassas (University 
                      of Oxford), Jurgen De Wispelaere (Trinity College Dublin) 
                      and Stuart White (University of Oxford) explicitly wanted 
                      to explore the notion of a basic income society, its likely 
                      form and limitations, and how pathways towards its achievement 
                      could be conceived. To this effect they invited a number 
                      of speakers who are sympathetic to both the strengths and 
                      limitations of basic income.<br>

                      first day of the conference comprised a round table debating 
                      the normative justification of basic income schemes from 
                      a republican perspective. So a central question was 'How 
                      does a basic income contribute to us being free citizens?' 
                      Building on recent work in republican political theory, 
                      David Casassas (University of Oxford), Daniel Ravent&oacute;s 
                      (University of Barcelona), Carole Pateman (University of 
                      Cardiff/UCLA), Stuart White (University of Oxford) and Karl 
                      Widerquist (University of Reading) discussed various aspects 
                      of republican political thought and whether this perspective 
                      can offer a robust philosophical justification for the basic 
                      income society. Casassas and Ravent&oacute;s outlined a 
                      strong republican case for basic income, with Pateman, White 
                      and Widerquist introducing critical remarks. Most of the

                      the normative justification and political feasibility of 
                      the basic income society. In his introductory lecture, Tony 
                      Fitzpatrick (University of Nottingham) offered an assessment 
                      of the current state of the basic income debate a decade 
                      after the publication of his book Freedom and Security. 
                      Fitzpatrick identified both theoretical and practical challenges 
                      that basic income advocates must engage with when advancing 
                      the debate. (See Tony Fitzpatrick's article on page 5 of

                      next panel offered two papers discussing the ideal of the 
                      basic income society. Bill Jordan (University of Plymouth) 
                      challenged the strong individualist focus of much of the 
                      basic income debate, suggesting that advocates and researchers 
                      instead should be more concerned with social value (and 
                      the ways in which it can be promoted) if basic income is 
                      to deliver on its promises in terms of emancipation and 
                      freedom. Jos&eacute; Antonio Noguera (Universitat Aut&ograve;noma 
                      de Barcelona) then questioned the very idea of a basic income 
                      society, arguing that basic income advocates should not 
                      overstate the role and importance of these policies in current 
                      welfare arrangements. In her invited commentary, Louise 
                      Haagh engaged with both papers, offering an account of basic 
                      income from an institutional point of view.<br>

                      lunch the conference moved from the ideal of the basic income 
                      society to examining some aspects of the political feasibility 
                      of basic income schemes, and how these insights might impact 
                      on the form of the proposed basic income society. The first 
                      contribution by David Purdy (University of Manchester) posed 
                      the question whether basic income could be viable, taking 
                      into account the dynamics of basic income schemes once introduced. 
                      Purdy suggested this question must be assessed in a way 
                      that allows basic income proponents to engage with social 
                      institutions as well as existing social forces, but was 
                      adamant that, when properly analysed basic income will prove 
                      viable. In the second contribution Jurgen De Wispelaere 
                      (Trinity College Dublin) suggested that a governance perspective 
                      might offer important insights on the design of basic income 
                      schemes. He focussed much of his presentation on outlining 
                      a governance dilemma in which basic income designs trade-off 
                      effectiveness and political legitimacy, and that must be 
                      resolved before basic income can become a genuinely feasible 
                      policy. In his invited commentary, Yannick Vanderborght 
                      (Facult&eacute;s Universitaires St.Louis, Brussels) offered 
                      some critical comments on both papers. The conference ended 
                      with a round table with the main participants of the second 
                      day, giving the audience another opportunity to engage with 
                      the speakers.<br>

                      Studies, Oxford University, hosted a Keynote Address by 
                      Amitai Etzioni on Guaranteed Basic Income (GBI). The lecture 
                      opened the Foundation's two-day conference on 'The Contract 
                      for Income Support and Pensions in the Modern Welfare State', 
                      attended by an international panel of government officials, 
                      policymakers, academics, economists, and political scientists. 
                      <br>
                      Professor Etzioni, a former Senior Advisor to the White 
                      House and President of the American Sociological Association, 
                      speaking to an audience at Rhodes House, Oxford, argued 
                      that everyone should be entitled to a guaranteed basic income 
                      'as a reflection of our basic humanity'. <br>

                      his standpoint as founder of the Communitarian Network, 
                      he outlined his proposal for a GBI that is not means tested 
                      and not contingent on people's ability to work. Etzioni 
                      argued that we are not complete human beings when deprived 
                      of lasting, meaningful human relationships, and that we 
                      have basic obligations toward one another that GBI can help 
                      to engender. A basic income, he went on to say, would allow 
                      for a stakeholder society that would mitigate the dependence 
                      of the disempowered and foster mutual respect.<br>

                      Adams, FLJS Chairman, opened the conference the following 
                      day as part of the Foundation's programme on the Social 
                      Contract, which aims to examine the reciprocal rights and 
                      obligations between the citizens and the state in modern 
                      liberal society. <br>

                      first speaker, Professor Peter Edelman, drawing on his experience 
                      as a servant in all three branches of US government, challenged 
                      the idea that welfare causes dependency, and called for 
                      an expanded conception of the social contract from a commitment 
                      to end poverty to a determination to achieve a living income 
                      for everyone. Dalmer Hoskins, the newly appointed Chief 
                      Officer for Strategic Planning of the US Social Security 
                      Administration, corroborated this perspective of American 
                      welfare, attacking the 'myth' of the US pension policy and 
                      the US healthcare system that is 'spinning out of control'.

                      alternatives were explored, including the Swedish model 
                      for merging welfare with the social contract to produce 
                      a system of income support which verges on a basic income, 
                      albeit one that is slightly means-tested. Avia Spivak, former 
                      deputy governor of the Bank of Israel, examined the increased 
                      economic risks caused by ageing populations through case 
                      studies of Sweden and Chile, and Jef van Langendonck proposed 
                      a global welfare fund to which governments would contribute, 
                      enforced by international trade agreements.<br>

                      Lucy Williams and Charles Mills offered feminist and racial 
                      critiques of the precepts underlying social contract theory, 
                      arguing that it obscures the roots of poverty by 'naturalising' 
                      it, thereby ignoring the imbalance of assets and opportunity 
                      inherent in most societies. The conference concluded with 
                      an assessment of the feasibility of GBI by the sociologist 
                      Michael Opielka, and Professor Charles Murray's proposal 
                      for GBI as a replacement for the welfare state. </font></font></p>

                      I was invited to address this conference, the task that 
                      I was set involved outlining the main challenges facing 
                      the Basic Income debate and the main limitations of the 
                      BI community in meeting them. I am more capable of addressing 
                      the former than the latter, as a brief autobiography will 
                      explain.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BI 
                      was the subject of my PhD (1992-95). So by the time of its 
                      eventual publication, as <i>Freedom &amp; Security</i> in 
                      1999, I had basically spent 6/7 years on the same subject. 
                      As I pursued other interests, my work on BI became largely 
                      confined to book reviews and article refereeing, though 
                      it continued to appear in the background or in the margins 
                      of my publications. Essentially, I really only came back 
                      to the debate in 2007. In other words, I say the following 
                      as an old friend but also as something of an outsider.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                      have tried to update my knowledge of the literature I missed 
                      during those 8 years, and failed. To a large extent this 
                      failure was because I encountered a literature far wider 
                      and deeper than that which I met in the early 1990s. This 
                      makes the debate harder to summarise than was the case 10 
                      to 15 years ago. I suspect anyone approaching the subject 
                      the way I did in my PhD would now have a far harder job.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Perhaps 
                      the biggest change between then and now lies in the global 
                      scale of the debate. I was initially sceptical when I heard 
                      that the Basic Income European Network (BIEN) had changed 
                      its name to the Basic Income Earth Network; it seemed like 
                      a desperate attempt to preserve a beloved acronym. But my 
                      scepticism has since faded. So whereas in the mid-1990s 
                      the debate centred upon the UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland, 
                      Canada and Brazil, today the list would be much longer.

                      no. 1</i>, then, derives from the opportunity which this 
                      expanding interest brings. How do we disseminate information 
                      and coordinate efforts effectively about worldwide debates 
                      and developments?<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                      seems to me that the BI community has done an admirable 
                      job of archiving and documenting these developments. BIEN 
                      genuinely offers a resource that captures ongoing developments 
                      and literatures, either in full or at least as signposts 
                      that the eager researcher can follow. <br>

                      back into the debate has made it clear what <i>challenge 
                      no. 2 </i>is: with BI continuing to hover at the peripheries 
                      of many policy and reform agendas (having made a clear breakthrough 
                      only in Brazil and Alaska; though there seem to be some 
                      interesting developments in Mexico) the challenge is to 
                      continue to debate ideas and design proposals without any 
                      guarantee of success. How to maintain enthusiasm when many 
                      (or most?) in government are indifferent or dismissive?; 
                      how to translate casual interest/support into something 
                      more? The difficulty here is to return again and again to 
                      some fundamental questions, in the hope that we are providing 
                      resources that future political reformers will be able to 
                      draw upon.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My 
                      revisiting of the debate, then, immediately threw up a series 
                      of familiar questions. Can an unconditional income be justified? 
                      What type of BI scheme is desirable? What type of BI scheme 
                      is most realistic? What would the impact of BI be for poverty, 
                      class inequalities, gender inequalities, labour market participation, 
                      participative citizenship, etc.? How does BI compare to 
                      other reform proposals? I won't go through all of these, 
                      but I do have a few observations.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      the early 90s I came across many people who would simply 
                      deny categorically that BI, and the unconditional principle 
                      in general, could be justified. The BI community is to be 
                      congratulated for making that kind of knee-jerk response 
                      harder to sustain. Even those who wish to reject it have 
                      to treat the principle seriously. This is perhaps because 
                      15 years ago or more we were tapping effectively into fundamental 
                      philosophies, debates and schools of thought where discussion 
                      is always ongoing, and to some extent irresolvable. The 
                      unconditional principle has its roots in many of these fundamental 
                      ideas and so can hardly be dismissed. It was no surprise, 
                      then, that familiar themes reappeared during my reading, 
                      including: liberty, citizenship, common good, justice, equality, 
                      efficiency, pragmatism. <br>

                      perhaps exists now is greater clarity over what, for me, 
                      is central; namely, the 'exploitation/reciprocity' arguments 
                      lurking within several of these debates. When do we exploit 
                      more? Is a BI something for nothing? Do I exploit you because 
                      your labour pays for my BI? Or, do I enable you to earn 
                      more, through your labour, by yielding up to you that part 
                      of our commonly owned resources to which I am entitled as 
                      a right? It seems to me that over the last eight years two 
                      features of the debate have been highlighted as crucial.

                      to 3 (since 2 seems merely a matter of charity). However, 
                      the most fruitful discussions have centred around the plausibility 
                      (or otherwise) of 4. And this still seems to me to be the 
                      case.<br>

                      well as addressing the reasonableness of 4, my recent work 
                      has also returned to a second key part of the unconditionality 
                      debate, namely (a) the extent to which we have control over 
                      the institutional contexts that shape our lives; (b) the 
                      extent to which we can and should have such control; (c) 
                      the meaning of 'we'; and (d) the means of effecting such 
                      control. These are obviously big questions, with many insisting 
                      that a satisfactory answer involves guaranteeing access 
                      to a labour market characterised by meaningful jobs and 
                      decent wages. For others, such reliance on labour market 
                      participation can never be perfect, requiring some form 
                      of compensatory justice, and therefore a BI; for others, 
                      such reliance already locks people into a form of social 
                      membership which, while important, should not necessarily 
                      predominate, so a BI is justified as an extra-market income 
                      that gives people greater control over when and why they 
                      enter into relations of the wage contract. Over the last 
                      10 to 15 years it seems to me that there has been some mutual 
                      respect and indeed rapprochement between these two perspectives 
                      (certainly in 1992 trade unions were very dismissive). But 
                      arguably more is needed.<br>

                      any event it has always seemed to me that those committed

                      sell it is and are prepared to accept a gradual, experimental, 
                      evolutionary process of change. In short, it is not a matter 
                      of having to resolve this first question (can an unconditional 
                      income be justified?) before we can move on to the others 
                      I mentioned earlier. Any sportsperson will confirm that

                      this business of an 'experimental, evolutionary process 
                      of change' I was interested to see the extent to which the 
                      North American experiments with Negative Income Tax (NIT), 
                      30 to 40 years ago, were still being argued over. When I 
                      looked at the available literature 15 years ago the debate 
                      seemed to be moribund and whenever I mentioned NIT to people 
                      outside the BI debate many tended to roll their eyes or 
                      else scratch their heads trying to remember this thing from 
                      the 1960s/70s. 'Oh, yes, wasn't it proved that NIT would 
                      help create a lazy, promiscuous underclass?' For, by the 
                      1990s, most of the left were content to ignore what looked 
                      like another form of means-testing, one associated with 
                      Milton Friedman to boot; and the right had achieved a hegemony 
                      whose appetite for large-scale reform, especially after 
                      the events of the 1980s, had diminished.<br>
                      So, I think those who have wanted to revisit the lessons 
                      of the experiments are correct to assert both that computer 
                      simulations can get us only so far and that we need hard, 
                      scientific data on some of the main BI schemes. Of course, 
                      there is no guarantee that new experiments will evade the 
                      political distortions, media misunderstandings and popular 
                      misconceptions which affect the legacy of the NIT experiments. 
                      Such experiments introduce new problems and margins of error. 
                      But these are at least problems we can triangulate with 
                      simulations and other forms of statistical data to reach 
                      a richer view of what a BI would imply for labour market 
                      participation, etc. <br>

                      we might call it. In the 1990s, such utopian pragmatism 
                      seemed somehow marginal. When I moved to Edinburgh University 
                      in 1992, Thatcherism was still the dominant reference point 
                      and the opposition was split between those defending social 
                      insurance (an improved Beveridge approach) and those who 
                      were pushing for a partial reconciliation with the neoliberal 
                      revolution. The Commission for Social Justice 1 was not 
                      Blairism in short trousers - its prescriptions <i>could</i> 
                      have pushed us in other directions; but its language of 
                      'investors vs. levellers' did clear a path for Blairite 
                      social democrats. In short, no one saw much of a role for

                      the Labour Party, recent thinking on child poverty has been 
                      influenced by reports from Lisa Harker and David Freud. 
                      2 Both support a greater degree of employment and employability, 
                      personalisation, outreach and flexibility in the interactions 
                      between benefit clients and providers. Both, in other words, 
                      are in tune with the welfare-to-work agenda. Harker, however, 
                      is happy to represent hers as a 'welfarist welfare-to-work' 
                      position because she is sensitive to the need to respect 
                      the autonomy of claimants. Freud's position is more 'workfarist 
                      welfare-to-work'. He adopts a language which is very much, 
                      'We the taxpayer proclaim these truths to be self-evident. 
                      We won't pay for these benefit-claiming malingerers any 
                      more.' He expects that most people on Incapacity Benefit 
                      can be transferred off. So whereas Harker is also willing 
                      to underline the drawbacks of a work-first approach and 
                      the damaging impact of income/wealth inequalities, the government 
                      is more comfortable with continuing to stress Freud's emphasis 
                      upon claimants' obligations. It is in this context that 
                      other, welcome noises about the need to simplify the benefit 
                      system need to be seen.<br>

                      instance, some influential people within the BI debate have 
                      attempted a reformulation of welfare policies and social 
                      democracy. Post-productivism has been promoted by those 
                      such as Robert Goodin who has defined it as combining 'temporal 
                      adequacy' (people having more available time and greater 
                      control over the use of their time) and 'minimal conditionality' 
                      (people receiving a minimum income as a citizenship right 
                      rather than as a result of state and/or market compulsion). 
                      In these terms, mainstream thinking corresponds to what 
                      I would call 'productivism'. I won't labour the idea here, 
                      but by productivism I basically mean a social culture in 
                      which economic growth is seen as<i> the</i> instrument of 
                      social change, progress, and problem-solving. In terms of 
                      contemporary social democracy, the continued emphasis is 
                      likely to be upon employment, minimum wages, wage-supplements, 
                      and welfare conditionality. Given the (modest) successes 
                      of New Labour, questioning this approach can make you seem 
                      somewhat messianic to political 'insiders'. For this kind 
                      of 'productivist' social democracy SWAB, or something resembling 
                      it, might be as far as we get to a BI, the goal here being 
                      primarily one of labour market insertion and reward for 
                      labour market effort.<br>

                      own humble efforts have defined post-productivism as that

                      serves the ecological and emotional values without which 
                      labour, productivity, growth, and therefore affluence, cannot 
                      thrive. Only that form of economic growth which demonstrably 
                      enhances emotional and ecological sources of wealth should 
                      be supported. We need to 'restock' the socio-ecological 
                      sources of affluence more urgently than most governments 
                      have admitted, scaling down our preferences to a level which 
                      our societies and ecosystems can accommodate. This means 
                      putting less reliance upon commodities and exchange-value

                      welfare' tell us exactly when that kind of society existed?) 
                      is in fact a bizarre caricature of the 'nothing-for-something' 
                      realities that the worst kind of workfare and activation 
                      programmes have produced. If we genuinely wish a 'something-for-something' 
                      society then it seems to me that an underlying layer of 
                      unconditional provision is warranted. You can't expect people 
                      to climb a ladder if you knock away the bottom rungs. The 
                      argument for BI is that it puts greater power into the hands 
                      of people themselves, as does employers paying people salaries 
                      rather than in-kind vouchers. ('Salary' is one of those 
                      words which has radically changed its meaning. It derives 
                      from the Roman practice of doling out salt to soldiers, 
                      an in-kind payment). If we are genuinely concerned about 
                      active citizenship then perhaps we ought to recreate something 
                      closer to the Roman practice for wage-earners too! Those 
                      who defend conditionality are intellectually obligated to 
                      support a more honest version than currently prevails, so 
                      that, for example, instead of obsessing about the usual 
                      suspects, we force the undeserving rich to work too. But 
                      at the moment we are stuck in no-man's-land, receiving the 
                      best neither of unconditionality nor of conditionality.<br>

                      any event <i>challenge no. 6</i> leads on from no. 5: the 
                      challenge for BI advocates is to think against what is 'common 
                      sense' or 'public opinion'. I put these in commas because 
                      we can all think of how these phrases are used to serve 
                      a particular agenda. They are constructions that we need 
                      to crack open and reconfigure if we are to speak to the 
                      politics of the future. This does not mean that 'common 
                      sense' and 'public opinion' are illusions/myths to be manipulated 
                      by the cynical, it means that they are fields of interpretative 
                      meaning and political struggle upon which different versions 
                      of common sense and public opinion clash and compete. For 
                      the anti-BI person it is obvious that BI violates an ethic 
                      of desert; for the BI advocate it is clear that this ethic 
                      is violated all the time and that a BI is needed partly 
                      as compensation for that failure and partly to reorder the 
                      distribution of primary social resources so that genuine 
                      effort can be underpinned by income security.<br>

                      some extent this is about globalisation, a concept that 
                      was barely creeping on to the agenda in the early to mid 
                      1990s but which has since exploded. At that time two questions 
                      cropped up: could a substantial BI be implemented given 
                      the global mobility of capital, and should a residence test 
                      be attached to BI? Both of these questions remain relevant. 
                      The first explains why some people prefer to discuss BI 
                      as a regional, and even global, proposal rather than merely 
                      a national one. What has altered is the extent to which 
                      BI is seen as a potential staging-post to a socialist society. 
                      Such analyses are less in evidence now.<br>

                      is the second question which has gained in resonance given 
                      the endless hair-wrenching panics about migration that have 
                      characterised the UK (among other west European countries) 
                      in recent years. At its crudest these are worries about 
                      welfare tourism - though the evidence for such tourism is 
                      slender. But the notion that migrants have to assimilate 
                      and integrate (in contrast to some multicultural moral/cultural 
                      relativism that supposedly dominates our thinking) has become 
                      a debate impossible to avoid.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                      would be easy to characterise BI as unfair to indigenous 
                      populations. If my entitlement as a citizen of 40 years 
                      is the same as yours when you have been here 40 days, then 
                      won't that feed into paranoia about being exploited by outsiders? 
                      Does this mean there is a trade-off between BI and migration? 
                      If so, in which direction should this take us? Can BI only 
                      become economically feasible and politically credible if 
                      inward migration is restricted? Or do the benefits of migration 
                      mean that BI is a non-starter?<br>
                      We could support the idea of unrestricted mobility. Perhaps 
                      there is no significant distinction between moving from 
                      Mali to London and moving from London to Birmingham. We 
                      might favour BI as that which facilitates such open migration 
                      (by reducing the costs of relocation and occupational transition, 
                      for instance) while retaining the social protections of 
                      state welfare that some feel open migration would threaten.<br>

                      if open migration remains a tough sell for the foreseeable 
                      future then an alternative is to stress (1) that access 
                      to basic welfare services is required in order for everyone 
                      to perform the tasks of social participation that we demand 
                      from one another, but (2) that properly designed social 
                      insurance facilitates solidarities, civic participation 
                      and interaction, without marking out either minority communities 
                      or recent arrivals as problem populations. A BI (along with 
                      health and education entitlements) could constitute the 
                      welfare floor from which upward steps of contributory insurance

                      these paradoxes point to is ambivalence over the meaning 
                      and implications of choice. (Something could also be said 
                      about care in this context, but I will leave this to one 
                      side.) The marketisation of society and social risks has 
                      engendered economic and cultural fragmentation, such that 
                      contemporary social policies are characterised less by interventions 
                      intended to reduce socio-economic inequalities and more 
                      by attempts to control the exercise of choice. This is a 
                      kind of 'situational engineering' through which the possibilities 
                      of action are manipulated. The freedom to earn, consume, 
                      possess and exchange is always accompanied by a demand that 
                      we earn, consume, possess and exchange responsibly. Choice 
                      thus becomes both an impulse to be realised and a liberation 
                      that must be reined in if it is not to create social breakdown.<br>

                      seems to me that BI debates have to find a way of harnessing 
                      choice while disentangling it from the possessive individualism 
                      which gives rise both to free market cultures that skew 
                      the meaning of freedom and to social re-regulations that 
                      are excessively prohibitive. In simple terms this means 
                      thinking again about paternalism.<br>

                      was the aim of a recent article of mine in which I thought 
                      about how we can combine the best that stakeholder grants 
                      have to offer with those that BI has to offer. Proponents 
                      of asset-based welfare argue that people should be entitled 
                      to a considerable stock of assets, of material resources 
                      or their equivalent. Commentators disagree over how that 
                      stock should be manifested. Some see a role for the provision 
                      of capital grants that could either be used for whatever 
                      purposes the recipient sees fit, or which could be attached 
                      to circumscribed activities (education, house buying, or 
                      business start-ups). I have argued that the distinction 
                      between BI and capital grants, while real, has been overstated. 
                      We can imagine, for instance, a system whereby BI's income 
                      stream could be converted into grant-like 'pools' of financial 
                      resources that could be used for education, etc., or which 
                      could be used to fund employment sabbaticals. <br>

                      the persuasiveness of such ideas I suspect we need to continue

                      for ourselves: to plough on, encouraging, navigating and 
                      utilising the BI community's diversity. We need to continue 
                      to establish the practicality and respectability of BI, 
                      its consistency with established practices, and to argue 
                      for ways in which the mainstream needs to change. This requires 
                      us to adopt the stance I referred to earlier: one of multiple 
                      vision, of utopian realism, of radical pragmatism.<br>

                      compare the chapter in each book that looks at the UK.<br>
                      Kemp look at the UK in Chapter 6. He gives a brief overview 
                      of our benefits system, repeating the government's claim 
                      that 'The tax credit for people with low earnings ... and 
                      a national minimum wage were both introduced to help make 
                      work pay'. As an aside, it is of course the position of 
                      the Citizen's Income Trust that the best way of making work 
                      pay is to reduce the marginal withdrawal rate.<br>

                      traces the history of housing benefit, rent controls, and 
                      subsidies for home-ownership in the tax and welfare system 
                      from 1915 onwards. Particularly interesting is his point 
                      that 'the means tested [non-contributory] assistance scheme 
                      was more generous that the [contributory] insurance scheme. 
                      National Insurance recipients with high rent were able to 
                      top up their incomes by applying for National Assistance 
                      to cover the difference'. Also telling is 'The way in which 
                      Housing Benefit is calculated is relatively simple. Tenants 
                      whose income is more than the social assistance benefit 
                      rates are entitled to a Housing Benefit payments that is 
                      equal to their eligible rent minus 65% of the difference 
                      between their net income and the social assistance benefit 
                      rates'. Kemp does not mention until later on that the eligibility 
                      criteria for and way in which Council Tax Benefit is calculated 
                      are very similar, and that this is withdrawn at a further 
                      20% of a claimants income above the same basic benefit levels.<br>

                      points out that 'Housing Benefit ... is also an important 
                      contributor to their landlords' rental income stream ... 
                      cuts in Housing Benefit will consequently have an adverse 
                      impact, not only on direct recipients but also indirectly 
                      on their landlords ... For this reason, landlords and the 
                      banks that lend mortgages to them have been very wary or 
                      critical of proposals to cut or reform Housing Benefit.'<br>

                      Housing Allowance for private tenants and the first evaluations 
                      of pilot areas, concluding that 'the evidence so far suggests 
                      that the LHA represents an important, but not particularly 
                      marked, improvement on the previous Housing Benefit scheme 
                      for private tenants'.<br>
                      Groves takes a briefer and more general look at 'Housing

                      takes a wider view than Kemp and also looks at the way in 
                      which successive governments have reduced the generosity 
                      of old age pensions and encouraged older people to finance 
                      their retirement by equity release schemes, which he says 
                      quite rightly is relying on the 'lottery of the market'. 
                      He also explains Thatcher's 'Right to buy' and the current 
                      government's ideas on asset-based welfare. ('Right to buy' 
                      is now known as 'Choice to own').<br>
                      Groves looks at state support for housing in Singapore, 
                      Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan. The main 
                      emphasis in these countries seem to be encouraging home 
                      ownership, via compulsory savings schemes and subsidies 
                      rather than subsidising poorer tenants.<br>

                      the two books, Kemp provides the far better overview in 
                      Chapter 1. Groves' first chapter seems to consist largely 
                      of a summary of other research into housing and welfare, 
                      using expressions such as 'decommodification' and 'corporatist 
                      or egalitarian redistributive models', 'welfare states emerge 
                      as a result of universal physiological forces, technological 
                      determinism or as a consequence of industrialisation'. Kemp, 
                      on the other hand, takes much greater pains to put 'Housing 
                      allowance in context'.<br>

                      book assumes that households will consume less of goods

                      will potentially distort a consumer's expenditure pattern, 
                      thus creating a marginal cost, an inefficiency for that 
                      consumer, and an economic burden greater than the tax paid.

                      authors recognize that taxation is not simply a way of raising 
                      revenue for the Government and that other social policy 
                      factors are relevant, such as the environmental impact of 
                      carbon tax (a tax on carbon dioxide emissions), and in this 
                      area the authors find that an increase in carbon tax causes 
                      only a small effect on family after-tax income, an ambiguous 
                      distribution pattern, and no large distributional effects. 
                      The marginal welfare cost is low, and thus the tax is relatively 
                      efficient. On taking a variety of factors into account (such 
                      as the relative fuel use efficiency of different industries), 
                      the authors conclude that reductions in carbon dioxide emissions 
                      are possible without too much distributional effect and 
                      without costing too much. <br>

                        book is about a fundamental flaw in contemporary market 
                        economies that causes individuals to voluntarily work 
                        and consume too much while enjoying too little leisure. 
                        In working and consuming too much they are placing unreasonable 
                        and unsustainable demands on the environment. Furthermore, 
                        as the arguments in this book explain, unless the fundamental 
                        flaw is acknowledged and acted upon, humankind faces ever 
                        increasing environmental disamenity. This is because the 
                        characteristics of the fundamental flaw mean that the 
                        current problems of overwork and consequent environmental 
                        degradation reinforce each other leading us further and 
                        further away from the optimum. Over time, the extent to 
                        which work is excessive in relation to leisure grows continually 
                        along with the extent of environmental degradation. This 
                        is the outcome of the vicious circle of overwork and over 
                        consumption (p.ix).</font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      first chapter argues for an economic approach to this problem 
                      on the basis of a correlation between high levels of output 
                      per capita and high levels of environmental degradation 
                      per capita. The second chapter suggests that decreased unpleasantness 
                      of work, increased incomes, declining quality of life (leading 
                      to the pursuit of higher incomes in an attempt to rectify 
                      this for the individual) and the transfer of work effort 
                      from years of low productivity to years of high productivity 
                      have caused an increase in work hours. And the third chapter 
                      suggests that another important and often neglected factor 
                      is that to shift work from the home to the workplace increases 
                      externalities such as pollution and carbon emissions and 
                      thus shifts negative externalities from the home to the 
                      public realm. If we translate externalities of both work 
                      effort and increased consumption into an unhappiness alongside 
                      the happiness we receive from the income earned at work 
                      and the unhappiness derived from the disbenefits of work, 
                      then net happiness reaches zero at fewer work hours per 
                      week than if we ignore such externality unhappiness. Ignoring 
                      this externality unhappiness is the 'fundamental flaw' in 
                      the free market economic model which Robinson thinks we 
                      need to do something about by taking this externality into 
                      account and working fewer hours to ameliorate it and its 
                      attendant unhappiness.<br>

                      4 adds consideration of a limited information market failure 
                      to that of externalities. Chapter 5 offers a measurement 
                      of the excessive work effort we experience using a General 
                      Progress Indicator rather than Gross Domestic Product to 
                      measure wellbeing. Chapter 6 studies cumulative effects 
                      and international differences; and chapter 7 offers policies 
                      to tackle the fundamental flaw: working hours legislation, 
                      education, and taxation. The aim: to reduce work hours and

                      with Ricardo and Smith, the authors of these thorough and 
                      mathematically expressed chapters chart the history of economists' 
                      understandings of growth (understood here as growth of national 
                      product measured in financial terms) and distribution (again, 
                      understood in financial terms). So we travel via Smith (ch.1) 
                      and Ricardo (chs. 1, 2 and 3) to Marx (ch.4) to the neoclassical 
                      (chs. 5 to 8) and Keynesian (chs. 9 to 13) economists of 
                      the latter half of the twentieth century, though the fact 
                      that Keynesian and neoclassical effects can be found together 
                      (cf. p.184) suggests that not too much notice should be 
                      taken of the attempt to divide chapters into different schools 
                      of thought. Of particular interest is evidence of more nuanced 
                      models among neoclassical and Keynesian theorists. For instance, 
                      in chapter 6, Mario Pomini concludes that political and 
                      social mechanisms condition accumulation and growth and 
                      that 'the debate has reopened on the most appropriate economic 
                      policy measure for stimulating and sustaining economic growth, 
                      a much richer and more complex process than traditional 
                      [neoclassical] theory was prepared to admit, in which the 
                      public operator can perform a key role' (p.143); and in 
                      chapter 12 Antonio Agata shows that within post-Keynesian 
                      theory 'the economy can be stuck in an underemployment or 
                      overemployment steady state and that there is no automatic 
                      mechanism driving the economy toward a steady state with 
                      full employment, even if nominal prices and real wages are 
                      perfectly flexible' (p.281).<br>

                      The chart clearly reveals a poverty trap, particularly if 
                      the person is employed for only a few hours a week. Between 
                      0 hours and 12 hours per week earnings make almost no difference 
                      to net income. If someone has a general preference for leisure 
                      rather than for income then, as figure 6 shows, utility 
                      could be maximized at either or both 0 hours of employment 
                      and at 16 hours of employment, and isn't much less at any 
                      number of hours between 0 and 16 hours. Thus a poverty trap 
                      creates a considerable disincentive to increase the number 
                      of hours worked. </font></p>
