                      UK is today experiencing one of the worst economic crises 
                      of the post-War era. The current economic downturn is likely 
                      to affect the wellbeing and opportunities of British citizens 
                      for years to come, and will be especially painful for those 
                      vulnerable groups and individuals that were already struggling 
                      when the economy was booming. In addition, the crisis seriously 
                      impedes the capacity of the UK government to address these 
                      problems, and many citizens aren't convinced that they're 
                      going about it the right way. (Recent proposals for welfare 
                      activation in particular are a major cause of concern amongst 
                      policy analysts and advocates.) One policy instrument which 
                      the Government ought to consider as part of the solution 
                      to the crisis is a Citizen's Income, granted unconditionally 
                      as a right of citizenship, and this seminar series examines 
                      the prospects of instituting a Citizen's Income in the current 
                      economic climate.</font></p>

                      to prevent poverty and not simply to alleviate it, and her 
                      preferred reform option was social insurance. What was important

                      simply tinker with a system which has remained essentially 
                      unchanged since 1948. Today's radical, desirable and feasible

                      and the national minimum wage have been important in reducing 
                      poverty over the last ten years and will continue to be. 
                      With high levels of take-up, they have greater efficacy 
                      than many targeted measures and disproportionately benefit 
                      the worse off in society. Furthermore, progressive universalism 
                      ensures that everyone in society feels they are gaining, 
                      rather than some always giving, and others always receiving'

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our 
                      economy depends more than ever before on our people - on 
                      them making a contribution, aspiring to reach their full 
                      potential and taking responsibility for their skills needs. 
                      This matters for the individuals themselves and their families 
                      too - people making the most of their talents pro-motes 
                      social mobility and independence. To help achieve this, 
                      we need a welfare system that enables people to become the 
                      authors of their own lives.</font></p>

                      report recognizes that the benefits system needs to be simplified, 
                      but doesn't ask whether a radically simpler system, based 
                      on a Citizen's Income, might contribute to the main aim 
                      of encouraging people to make a contribution, aspire to 
                      reach their full potential, and take responsibility for

                      it stands the Government's approach is all stick and no 
                      carrot. If increased skills and work effort were to contribute 
                      a predictable increase in net income then there would be 
                      a significant incentive to learn new skills and seek higher 
                      paid employment; but the current system doesn't guarantee 
                      such a predictable increase. Currently all benefits except 
                      for Child Benefit are withdrawn as earned income rises, 
                      thus imposing not only a disincentive but also unpredictability 
                      in relation to net income. A Citizen's Income of any size 
                      would contribute towards the solution to this problem. If 
                      the Government is serious about reforming the welfare state 
                      then such a positive approach really ought to be tried.</font></p>

                        community itself responded to the introduction of the 
                        BIG by establishing their own 18-member committee to mobilize 
                        the community and advise residents on how they could improve 
                        their lives with the money. This suggests that the introduction 
                        of a BIG can effectively assist with community mobilisation 
                        and empowerment.</font></li>

                        the introduction of the BIG, child malnutrition in the 
                        settlement has dropped remarkably. Using a WHO measurement 
                        technique, the data shows that children's weight-for-age 
                        has improved significantly in just six months from 42% 
                        of underweight children to only 17%.</font></li>

                        the introduction of the BIG, the majority of people have 
                        been able to increase their work both for pay, profit 
                        or family gain as well as self-employment. This finding 
                        is contrary to critics' claims that the BIG would lead 
                        to laziness and dependency.</font></li>

                        evidence that more people are now able to engage in more 
                        productive activities and that the BIG fosters local economic 
                        growth and development. Several small enterprises started 
                        in Otjivero, making use of the BIG money being spent in 
                        the community.</font></li>

                        More children are now attending school and the stronger

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clearly, 
                      a CI scheme is not the answer to the credit crunch, which 
                      is global, and in the UK has more to do with decisions of 
                      various Governments to de-regulate the banking sector and 
                      financial services, and with the growing Public Sector Borrowing 
                      Requirement over the last decade. The boom of the last 16 
                      years or so has been financed by a house price bubble, and 
                      by both public and private debt. The UK has been spending 
                      above its means both publicly and privately, and some major 
                      adjustments will have to take place. However, could CI help 
                      to ameliorate the effects of a recession, or even worse, 
                      a depression?</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CI 
                      schemes provide several advantages over the present contribution-based 
                      National Insurance and the means-tested Social Assistance 
                      and Tax Credit systems. Nearly half of the population currently 
                      receives some type of benefit. The current systems are hedged 
                      about by so many rigidities and constraints that it discourages 
                      beneficiaries from taking any risks. For instance, a beneficiary 
                      may be reluctant to take up some work, because if s/he were 
                      dismissed a few weeks later, s/he would still have to wait 
                      for the required period before being eligible again for 
                      benefits. Replacing the current system with a CI scheme 
                      would provide flexibility in the labour market for the employees, 
                      (not just for employers). It puts the initiative back in 
                      the hands of the beneficiary, giving him/her the opportunity 
                      to take risks on his/her own behalf. Increased flexibility 
                      in the labour market would help the economy to pick up more 
                      quickly. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CI 
                      schemes also provide more incentives for beneficiaries to 
                      take even low-paid jobs. Means-tested systems have a built-in 
                      design fault, in that beneficiaries face benefit withdrawal 
                      rates in addition to paying personal income tax and National 
                      Insurance contributions, and in the UK the combined rates 
                      are often 68% and over. Thus, someone on the minimum wage 
                      of &pound;5.73 per hour, would end up with a net wage of 
                      only &pound;1.83 per hour - hardly an incentive. The Tax 
                      Credit systems provide an incentive for applicants to earn 
                      their first &pound;5,000, in order to qualify, but very 
                      little incentive to earn the next &pound;20,000. By contrast, 
                      with a CI scheme, everyone would pay the tax, but would 
                      not suffer a benefit withdrawal rate.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
                      of the important benefits of a CI scheme is that its redistributive 
                      aspects can help to regenerate the poorer regions of the 
                      UK, whether they are run down inner London estates or post 
                      industrial cities in the north. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Economic 
                      insecurity is one of the main stresses of life, for the 
                      rich as much as for poorer people. Most people are only 
                      two months income away from disaster, - losing their jobs, 
                      their homes and possibly their families. A CI scheme would 
                      give a greater degree of economic security to the population, 
                      who would know that, even with the modest levels of CI that 
                      are likely, they would be able to budget around those amounts 
                      as a minimum.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, 
                      the reduced administration costs of CI schemes would enable 
                      the government to reduce its civil service budget, and those 
                      made redundant would, of course, receive their CI.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Major 
                      disasters require major rethinking. The world cannot go 
                      on as it has been. Disasters can also turn out to be times 
                      of great civil unrest and the overthrowing of the status 
                      quo for good or ill. They are times of opportunities as 
                      well as of problems. The present financial d&eacute;bacle 
                      and the looming depression may in fact present our best 
                      opportunity to address some of the major problems facing 
                      the world, such as its extremes of inequality, and the ecological 
                      disasters associated with global warming waiting round the 
                      corner. Maybe, the time for CI has come. Let us try to ensure 
                      that the reforms which are taken up are the ones that most 
                      of us would prefer. </font></p>

                      in Latin America, and thus explains why discourses centring 
                      on child labour have become increasingly interested in the 
                      logic of CCTs as a mechanism to address the phenomenon of 
                      child labour.</font></p>

                      aim is to encourage the anti child labour lobby and those 
                      practitioners who work in the area of child labour to consider 
                      a Citizen's Income as a policy that could help to eliminate 
                      child labour. Similarly, individuals working on a Citizen's 
                      Income ought to privilege the elimination of child labour 
                      as an important effect of a Citizen's Income, even if the 
                      Citizen's Income cash transfer is not designed to target 
                      child labour head-on. By doing this we might find more appropriate 
                      entry points for a Citizen's Income. By combining their 
                      efforts, perhaps the anti child labour lobby and advocates 
                      of a Citizen's Income might add value to one another and 
                      help to create a world more fit for the 218 million children 
                      who are toiling away at present (ILO, 2006: table 1.1, p.6).

                      until now the dialogue between advocates of a Citizen's 
                      Income and those working to eliminate child labour has been 
                      rather limited and they both continue to pass each other 
                      by, like two ships at night. This represents a major missed 
                      opportunity. Put simply: it would be prudent strategically 
                      to move the logic of a Citizen's Income higher on the agenda 
                      of those agencies that have a commitment to ending child 
                      labour. In particularly, this lobby needs to be aware that 
                      Citizen's Income is a proposal that is not just theoretical 
                      but manifests itself in various almost fully-fledged and 
                      applied forms around the globe, such as the Alaskan Permanent

                      Moreover, the prestigious historical pedigree of the proposal 
                      is also little known. </font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
                      child labour is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon 
                      not reducible to exclusively economic explanations, poverty 
                      is often the main cause. A Citizen's Income can address 
                      household poverty and empower families to overcome the need 
                      and temptation to put their children into child labour as 
                      a way to boost income during times of economic difficulty 
                      or as a form of social insurance to offset and prepare for 
                      future economic hardship and insecurity.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">CCTs 
                      have been effective in reducing child labour even when not 
                      tied explicitly to the objective of eliminating child labour. 
                      Mexico's Oportunidades programme, which does not specifically 
                      target child labour, has reduced the probability of children 
                      undertaking labour by as much as 14 per cent for children 
                      aged 8 to 17 (in Tabatabai, 2006: viii). There was substantial 
                      decline in child labour in Latin America during 2000-2004, 
                      by as much as two thirds, and this may be in part due to 
                      widespread adoption of CCTs in the region (IPEC, 2006: 7-8). 
                      In absolute terms, the number of children at work has fallen 
                      by 17 million children and now only 5 per cent of children 
                      are engaged in such work. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
                      the evidence that CCTs are effective in reducing child labour 
                      is not conclusive, and further research is needed. Other 
                      factors may account for the substantial decline, such as 
                      economic growth. The Oportunidades programme was not tied 
                      exclusively to the goal of combating child labour yet seems 
                      to have contributed to a reduction of child labour. Similarly, 
                      a Citizen's Income could play a role in reducing child labour 
                      because a reduction in child labour could be a significant 
                      spin-off of its general poverty-reducing properties. </font></p>

                      these are to an extent mere suppositions and the expression 
                      of political preference. It is possible to argue that universal 
                      and unconditional cash transfers such as a Citizen's Income 
                      might have some key advantages over CCTs in terms of impact 
                      on child labour. These advantages can be seen in the experience 
                      of the Child Support Grant in South Africa [CSG]. The CSG 
                      was instituted in 1998 to address child poverty and it was 
                      originally a conditional grant. However, after the Taylor 
                      Commission of 2000 it was agreed that the grant would be 
                      more fit for purpose if it were not conditional on behaviour. 
                      Today it covers 7.5 million children. Income and assets 
                      are tested and the geographical area and type of household 
                      are also taken into consideration to identify eligible children 
                      in South Africa, so the CSG still does not fully conform 
                      to the logic of a Citizen's Income because it is mean-tested; 
                      but the reasons for dropping the conditional behaviour aspects 
                      of the grant are quite important in terms of demonstrating 
                      how a Citizen's Income might reduce child labour. The advantages 
                      are administrative and social advantages, and these will 
                      be illustrated through specific reference to the South African 
                      CSG and more general examples.</font></p>

                      There are fewer administrative costs with a Citizen's Income 
                      because there is no means-testing, targeting or reinforcement 
                      of conditionalities. (This is not true with the CSG). The 
                      savings in administrative costs leave more money available 
                      for the actual cash transfer. </font></p>

                      form it is intended to be a life-long income rather than 
                      a transient CCT.</font></p>

                      There are fewer moral hazards and there is less potential 
                      for corruption or divisive discretion associated with a 
                      Citizen's Income than with CCTs, something which was a big 
                      problem with the CSG. For example, in South Africa we saw 
                      what Standing calls the 'paternalist twitch' (Standing, 
                      2002: 208). This refers to a basic default tendency within 
                      the human psyche, and expresses itself as a desire or need 
                      to impose conditionality and testing on welfare. According 
                      to Leatt and Budlender, in this instance, welfare officials 
                      asked that people provide more evidence than was necessary 
                      when applying for the CSG: evidence which was not sanctioned 
                      at the national level (see Leatt and Budlender, 2006). While 
                      these extra, illegal conditionalities were not of a tremendously 
                      disturbing nature, they did increase the number of hoops 
                      through which families were obliged to jump in order to 
                      satisfy the eligibility criteria. This meant that there 
                      were bottlenecks in the delivery systems and that take-up 
                      was low, especially in the poorest areas. A Citizen's Income 
                      would side-step paternalistic testing and would not engender 
                      the damaging outcomes listed above.</font></p>

                      The Citizen's Income would increase take-up by the most 
                      excluded. The CSG in South Africa was originally conditional 
                      on behaviour and became far more effective in terms of take-up 
                      when conditions were removed. In fact, when the CSG was 
                      conditional, eligibility was so burdensome that as many 
                      as 90 per cent of eligible children failed to receive the 
                      grant. According to Samson et al., after conditions had 
                      been dropped, take-up rose by 58 per cent (Samson et al., 
                      2006: 11). Similarly, Child Benefit in the UK has nearly 
                      100 per cent take-up. </font></p>

                      regard to the last point, a Citizen's Income-type approach 
                      to the child labour problem may be better than CCTs in terms 
                      of the perverse effects generated. As Samson has argued 
                      in his debates with the World Bank, enforcing rigid conditions 
                      risks perverse outcomes. Conditionalities can 'punish the 
                      poorest, who face high costs to comply with requirements, 
                      particularly when high quality schools and health care are 
                      inaccessible' (Samson et al., 2007: 101). To give one example 
                      with reference to child labour: one can envisage that a 
                      condition specifically requiring withdrawal of children 
                      from hazardous work could mean that children may merely 
                      be transferred from 'very bad' work to 'bad work' as a kind 
                      of natural and demographic readjustment response. There 
                      would be a downgrading of child risk transference and displacement, 
                      but still this would represent the exchanging of one evil 
                      for a lesser evil.</font></p>

                      and well-resourced sector that holds significant public 
                      and political influence (i.e., UN agencies and numerous

                      This could elicit public sympathy and create support for 
                      more general universal and unconditional cash transfer programmes 
                      and it could also leave the Citizen's Income argument less 
                      open to attack. Child labour might therefore provide a good 
                      point of entry for a Citizen's Income and could permit the 
                      logic of a Citizen's Income to be grafted into the core 
                      of a society. Just as the Universal Citizen's Pension in

                      the suppositions of property rights advocates and his work 
                      shows a great deal of concern for disadvantaged people. 
                      He has not written on basic income, except for one short 
                      article in 1986 favoring a 'social minimum.' Even though 
                      he has not paid much attention to the basic income debate, 
                      participants in that debate should pay attention to him. 
                      Some of his arguments about property rights, homelessness, 
                      and political disagreement could be put together into an

                      two main arguments proposed to justify private property

                      to be found which provides an adequate justification for

                      many have next to none&quot; (p. 5). Any property system

                      book, Liberal Rights (1993) contains a chapter entitled, 
                      &quot;Homelessness and the Issue of Freedom,&quot; in which 
                      Waldron argues that the homeless are not only needy but 
                      unfree in the most liberal negative sense. Quite simply, 
                      &quot;No one is free to perform an action unless there is 
                      somewhere he is free to perform it&quot; (p. 310). The homeless 
                      face interference as they try to perform their most basic 
                      human functions such as sleeping, urinating, eating, and 
                      so on. They do not lack the ability to do these things; 
                      they face constant interference as they try to do them, 
                      because the laws say they have no place where they can do 
                      them legally. Without the right to sleep and eat, people 
                      have little ability to exercise rights to free speech and 
                      political participation.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                      Law and Disagreement (1999) Waldron focuses on the process 
                      of lawmaking rather than on what laws should exist, but 
                      even this book contains arguments that are important to 
                      the basic income debate. Waldron confronts the problem of 
                      fundamental and persistent political disagreement:</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">[W]e 
                      not only disagree about the existence of God and the meaning 
                      of life; we disagree also about what count as fair terms 
                      of co-operation among people who disagree about the existence 
                      of God and the meaning of life. We disagree about what we 
                      owe to each other in the way of tolerance, forbearance, 
                      respect, cooperation, and mutual aid (p. 1).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
                      faults political philosophers, especially John Rawls, for 
                      philosophizing about policy while ignoring the question 
                      of how to live with disagreement, 'It is rare to find a 
                      philosopher attempting to come to terms with disagreement 
                      about justice within the framework of his own political 
                      theory.'</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 
                      this starting point one might expect Waldron to propose 
                      an alternative to Rawls's theory of justice, specifically 
                      incorporating the problem of fundamental political disagreement. 
                      Such a framework could be extremely valuable to the basic 
                      income debate, because Rawls used the idea of consensus 
                      to justify a socially cooperative project to which individuals 
                      were obliged to contribute. He famously labelled those who 
                      refuse to contribute to the social project as lazy &quot;surfers&quot; 
                      who consume more than their fair share of leisure and who 
                      therefore have to claim to public funds. If there is a consensus 
                      that the social project is just, refusal to participate 
                      can only be motivated by laziness. However, if there is 
                      no such consensus, refusal to participate is not laziness 
                      but political dissent-the rejection of the terms and goals 
                      of the social project. Persistent political disagreement 
                      takes away much of the appeal of Rawls's contributive obligation.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Waldron 
                      does not go down this road, and instead focuses on how political 
                      disagreement implies that the most important individual 
                      right is the right to equal political participation in a 
                      democratic system with a sovereign legislature that represents 
                      the diversity of political opinion in society. Waldron's 
                      argument about political disagreement could be used just 
                      as effectively to defend the refusal to participate as a 
                      form of political dissent. This reasoning could be especially 
                      strong combined with Waldron's earlier arguments about homelessness, 
                      freedom, and property. Wittingly or not, Waldron's arguments 
                      can be used to form a powerful case for basic income.<br>

                      There were 232 names on the participants' list, and unsurprisingly, 
                      the largest contingent came from Ireland, many having come 
                      specifically to attend the first day. The number of people 
                      attending the main part of the conference was limited to 
                      170, this being the size of the main lecture theatre, and 
                      there was a waiting list of hopefuls.</font></p>

                      from many other European countries, including Portugal,

                      John Baker, Chair of BIEN Ireland. This led to a calm air 
                      of concentration on the basic income ideas by the participants 
                      throughout the conference. The sessions were held in the 
                      new, light and spacious Quinn Business School on the campus

                      was Ireland's day. The programme consisted of seven papers, 
                      all of which were very good, well informed, thoughtful presentations 
                      by people who are at the peaks of their professions. The 
                      morning's four papers were subtitled 'A Business -, A Trade 
                      Union -, An Economist's -, and A Community &amp; Voluntary

                      theme of the day 'Making Choices - Choosing Futures' with 
                      a consideration of an Appropriate Level of Minimum Income, 
                      The Case for a Universal State Pension in Ireland as in 
                      New Zealand, and lastly A Survey of the last three decades 
                      of BI in Ireland,. There was so much excellent reference 
                      material in these papers, that it was a relief to learn 
                      that they are available in book form, with the same title 
                      as the theme of the day Making Choices - Choosing Futures:

                      Income must be a major part of the answer to the question

                      a left-wing political perspective. Hugh D. Segal, a Senator

                      of long experience in the political arena became obvious, 
                      when Senator Segal immediately had us all in the palm of

                      the third plenary on Saturday morning, three people who 
                      had experience of making a difference by introducing a universal 
                      benefit for certain sections of their societies, testified 
                      to the tremendous impact that this had had. Guy Standing 
                      formerly of the ILO, now of Bath and Monash Universities, 
                      described a private subscription Citizen's Income scheme 
                      with which he is involved in Namibia. It has contributed 
                      to regenerating the local economy and it has helped to prevent 
                      poverty among children. He noted that grandparents spent 
                      much of their new pensions on their grandchildren. Rosani 
                      Cunha, National Secretary of Citizen's Income, Ministry 
                      of Social Development and Fight Against Hunger, Brazil, 
                      described how the Bolsa Familia, or Family Grant, had made 
                      a difference. Families, who previously could not afford 
                      to look after their children, reclaimed them from the streets 
                      and received the grant on condition that the children attended 
                      school and health clinics and underwent various health and 
                      nutrition programs. Thus the introduction of the Bolsa Familia 
                      addressed several problems at once. Finally, Dr Jean Swanson-Jacobs, 
                      Deputy Minister Social Development, Republic of South Africa, 
                      described similar beneficial effects of unconditional pensions 
                      in South Africa.</font></p>

                      followed by an open forum. The four speakers were Richard

                      the evening of Saturday 21 June. The business covered a

                      as co-chairs, (Guy after 22 years in office, since the first 
                      BIEN Congress in 1986), with appreciation of all that they

                      conference provided an opportunity for welfare rights and 
                      other advisors in Scotland to hear about the latest developments 
                      in benefits and tax credits. It was very well attended, 
                      and the atmosphere was warm and friendly as old friends 
                      renewed acquaintance. The theme of this year's conference 
                      was 'Welfare Rights 2008'. The current scene was laid out 
                      by John Dickie, Head of CPAG in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon 
                      MSP, Deputy First minister &amp; Cabinet Secretary for Health 
                      and Wellbeing, then outlined the Scottish Government's anti-poverty 
                      strategy, and the role of welfare rights work within that 
                      policy, and she spoke sympathetically about the aims of 
                      CPAG in Scotland.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before 
                      and after lunch, there were sessions where delegates could 
                      attend two out of the six workshops on 'Employment and support 
                      allowance, (ESA)', 'Kinship carers: allowances, benefits 
                      and tax credits', 'Refugees rights - an update', 'Local 
                      housing allowance', 'Medical evidence and tribunals', and 
                      'Right to reside'. These workshops were given by CPAG's 
                      Welfare Rights workers, a CPAG Solicitor, a Trustee, and 
                      the last one was presented by Commissioner Edward Jacobs 
                      of the Tribunals Service Social Security and Child Support 
                      Commissioners. The purpose of the workshops was to update 
                      delegates on changes in the legislation, how they will work 
                      in practice, to assess whether they really improve the situations 
                      of claimants, and, for instance, to work out the outcome 
                      when DWP and local government rules come into conflict. 
                      I was impressed by the detailed knowledge displayed by the 
                      leaders of the groups that I attended, and really thought 
                      that they each deserved a Ph.D for being able to sort out, 
                      commit to memory and communicate all the extremely complicated 
                      facts.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      last session was a panel debate and question time based 
                      on the theme 'A Welfare State to End Child Poverty: what 
                      should it look like?' The four panellists were Adrian Sinfield, 
                      Professor Emeritus of Social Policy, Edinburgh University, 
                      Kate Green, Chief Executive of CPAG, Peter Kelly, Director 
                      of The Poverty Alliance and me. Each of us put forward ideas 
                      for improving services to prevent child poverty. A CI scheme 
                      is likely to start by introducing a realistic Child Benefit, 
                      which reaches those parts of poverty that other schemes 
                      cannot reach. The foolhardiness of the Chancellor's announcing 
                      a cut of 2% in income tax rate this summer, which could 
                      have been used to meet the government's own targets to halve 
                      child poverty by 2010, did not pass unnoticed.</font></p>

                      I later commented to one CPAG employee that she would be 
                      out of a job if a CI scheme were adopted, she replied that 
                      that is already the aim of all CPAG workers: to make themselves 
                      redundant through having prevented child poverty.</font></p>

                      Birnbaum is a newcomer to the basic income debate who has 
                      quickly worked his way into the basic income movement. He 
                      completed his doctorate in 2008 at Stockholm University, 
                      and has already been awarded fellowships at Oxford University 
                      and at the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium under 
                      the supervision of Philippe Van Parijs. He has only been 
                      publishing since 2005, but he has already published six 
                      academic articles and chapters, five of which are on basic 
                      income.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just 
                      Distribution is Birnbaum's doctoral thesis. It is not an 
                      easy read. It is 240 pages of dense political philosophy 
                      that only people who intend to get deeply into the philosophical 
                      debate over basic income will want to read in full. It is 
                      aimed at people who have already read several of John Rawls's 
                      major works and some of the more philosophical works on 
                      distributive justice in general and basic income in particular. 
                      However, many of the arguments in this book are of interest 
                      to a wider audience, and I will try to give readers of CIT 
                      Newsletter a brief introduction to them.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Birnbaum's 
                      starting point is John Rawls's Theory of Justice, one of 
                      the most influential works of political philosophy of the 
                      Twentieth Century. Rawls's most famous proposition, &quot;the 
                      difference principle,&quot; stated that the distribution 
                      of benefits from the joint social project should take incentives 
                      into account, but decision makers should use incentives 
                      to maximize the benefit to the least advantaged individual. 
                      When do we stop giving more to high achievers? When doing 
                      so ceases to be in the interest of the least advantaged 
                      people. Such a principle sounds favourable to basic income, 
                      but Rawls balked when confronted with the question of whether 
                      the difference principle should benefit lazy &quot;surfers&quot; 
                      who enjoy the benefits of the social project without contributing. 
                      The least advantaged individual in Rawls's theory is not 
                      necessarily the poorest person, but the poorest contributor 
                      to the social project, apparently ruling out basic income.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Birnbaum's 
                      project is to admit that the surfer problem exists but also 
                      to argue that on balance an unconditional basic income would 
                      further the overall goals of a Rawlsian economy. The surfer 
                      problem is a strike against basic income, but it need not 
                      be decisive, if basic income has other benefits that further 
                      Rawlsian goals. Birnbaum discusses many such benefits. For 
                      example, many contributors would benefit from the assurance 
                      of unconditional support. People who contribute to the social 
                      project in ways other than paid labour will share more in 
                      the benefits that they help to create and will be better 
                      able to make their contribution if an unconditional basic 
                      income is available. Subjecting disadvantaged people to 
                      extensive supervision to make sure that they are eligible 
                      for conditional redistribution is harmful to the self-respect 
                      that Rawlsianism is supposed to accord to contributors. 
                      Basic income gives workers the power to refuse exploitive 
                      working conditions. Finally, there is a large amount of 
                      wealth in society that attaches to nonhuman resources, and 
                      that can therefore be distributed unconditionally without 
                      violating any principles of fairness to contributors. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      latter half of the book responds to criticisms based on 
                      reciprocity, responsibility, and feasibility. A regular 
                      basic income can be important to upholding the security 
                      and autonomy that individuals need in order to make well-informed 
                      choices as self-respecting, equal citizens, and it, therefore, 
                      helps maintain responsibility. Birnbaum concedes that a 
                      contributory ethos is necessary to maintain a Rawlsian society 
                      with or without basic income and that basic income might 
                      therefore lead to exploitation of those who hold the necessary 
                      ethos by those who don't. However, there is also a tension 
                      between the effort to eliminate any such exploitation and 
                      the neutrality-based goals of a liberal society. Birnbaum 
                      concludes that, given the constraints of feasibility, there 
                      is a tentative case to be made for a mixed redistributional 
                      system with some redistribution coming in the form of conditional 
                      benefits and some coming in the form of unconditional basic 
                      income.</font></p>

                      collection of mainly previously published articles and book 
                      chapters contains a single simple message: in Denmark there 
                      has been a battle between a social and political discourse 
                      about workfare and a social and political discourse about 
                      Citizen's Income, and the former has won the battle.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
                      really doesn't matter that there is a certain amount of 
                      repetition between the different chapters (- there always 
                      is in such collections): what the different chapters together 
                      achieve is a variety of viewpoints from which the Citizen's 
                      Income and workfare discourses can be explored and from 
                      which the relationships and conflicts between them can be 
                      understood.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Particularly 
                      interesting from a UK perspective is the occasional widespread 
                      nature of the Citizen's Income debate in Denmark. Whilst 
                      we have experienced here considerable understanding of a 
                      Citizen's Income's feasibility and desirability amongst 
                      academics, policy analysts and some parliamentarians and 
                      civil servants, the kind of public political debate which 
                      Denmark has experienced has eluded us. The Republic of Ireland 
                      comes closer to Denmark in this respect, which suggests 
                      that size of population might have something to do with 
                      it.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
                      well as the debate in Denmark being widespread socially 
                      and politically, it has also been widespread in terms of 
                      its relationships with ideologies and ideas. Christensen's 
                      chapters on the battles between the Citizen's Income and 
                      workfare discourses in the labour movement and the women's 
                      movement are particularly interesting.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So 
                      how can a social and political Citizen's Income discourse 
                      cease to be 'heretical' and become mainstream political 
                      and social debate? The author suggests that advocates should 
                      position themselves between exclusion and inclusion, thus 
                      avoiding the marginalisation which advocates experience 
                      if they treat a Citizen's Income as an alternative to the 
                      current socio-economic system and the marginalisation experienced 
                      when a Citizen's Income is treated simply as a minor administrative 
                      reform. He recommends Mathieson's notion of 'the unfinished', 
                      i.e. relating to the current situation and attempting to 
                      move it on to something very different. Here the workfare 
                      discourse is currently firmly in charge, and only a careful 
                      'unfinished' strategy will give the Citizen's Income discourse 
                      any leverage at all. Such a strategy is possible because 
                      a Citizen's Income relates both to practical problems with 
                      the present system and to substantial reforms of the current 
                      system, so avoiding both inclusion and exclusion is possible 
                      in principle.</font></p>

                      UK isn't Denmark, but many of the issues are the same, and 
                      particularly the dominance of the workfare discourse. This 
                      book contains some valuable lessons and it should be essential

                      are two ways of categorising welfare states: 'How much?' 
                      and 'How?'. In this important article Bambra shows how each 
                      of the numerous classification systems which have been offered 
                      since the 1950s have weighted these two different facts. 
                      She decides that the more useful categorisations are those 
                      which take account of both factors. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      problem with this article is that the 'How?' question is 
                      narrowly constructed, and only amounts to a question as 
                      to how much is funded by the state and how much by employers. 
                      The important matter of the structure of the entitlement 
                      system is not addressed. Yes, employer-funded schemes are 
                      contribution-based whereas state-funded systems are generally 
                      a mixture of both contribution-based and means-tested systems, 
                      so it might look as if the question as to how much the state 
                      pays and how much employers pay might act as a proxy for 
                      benefits structure, but the way in which means-testing is 
                      done and the extent of means-testing are entirely ignored 
                      in Bambra's categorisation, and this can't be right. To 
                      add a third factor, 'extent of means-testing', and a fourth, 
                      'marginal withdrawal rates', would provide a more useful 
                      way of categorising the different approaches to categorisation 
                      of welfare states.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      fifth factor is, of course, the extent of universal benefits 
                      such as Child Benefit: possibly a more important factor 
                      than all of the others when it comes to evaluating a welfare-state's 
                      structure on poverty reduction and labour market effects.</font></p>

                      change to the taxation system in Canada in 1988 has enabled 
                      Crossley and Jeon to conduct a natural experiment to test 
                      the effect of changes in marginal tax rates on labour market 
                      participation.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      Canadian tax system treats husband and wife jointly. Before 
                      the change, the husband received a tax allowance for the 
                      dependent spouse which reduced as the spouse's earnings 
                      rose. This meant that for each additional dollar earned 
                      by the woman, tax was paid on an additional dollar of the 
                      husband's income at the husband's highest current rate. 
                      After the change, deduction of the additional dollar of 
                      the husband's income was at a flat rate of 17%: the lowest 
                      tax rate. This meant that a low-earning husband experienced 
                      no change, whereas a high-earning husband experienced a 
                      change of 12% in their marginal tax rate.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      researchers chose two samples of couples similar in all 
                      respects except that the husbands in one sample earned $24,568 
                      (standard deviation $37) and the husbands in the other $53,273 
                      (standard deviation $195).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      simulation of average tax rates showed that for the low 
                      earners the tax reform created almost no change in net incomes, 
                      whereas for the high earners the effective marginal tax 
                      rate on the woman's additional income was considerably reduced, 
                      and that the difference was greatest for women earning $5,000. 
                      This suggested that the effect of the change on labour market 
                      participation was likely to show up most clearly in part-time 
                      employment rates. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      researchers found that labour market participation amongst 
                      wives of high-earning husbands increased by 10%, which they 
                      rightly suggest is both 'economically and statistically 
                      significant' (p.357); and, as they expected, they found 
                      that 'the principal effect of the reform was to increase 
                      incentives for part-time work' (p.357). Amongst the wives 
                      of low-earning husbands there was no significant change.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      conclusion which the researchers draw is that individualising 
                      the taxation system would increase labour supply amongst 
                      women. This is a valid conclusion to draw for systems in 
                      which the jointness of the system imposes high marginal 
                      tax rates on spouses of earning husbands. The researchers 
                      also rightly suggest that their research should be 'of interest 
                      &#133;. where the unit of taxation is the individual, but 
                      where recent trends towards means-tested benefits and tax 
                      credits on family income have increased the 'jointness' 
                      of the system' (p.362) - as in the UK.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">They 
                      might have drawn a further and more general conclusion: 
                      that lowering marginal tax rates increases labour market 
                      participation. This is an important result which should 
                      have been highlighted. The study of the effects of tax and 
                      benefits changes on labour market participation is still 
                      in its infancy, and this article contributes significantly 
                      to the field because it shows that increasing marginal tax 
                      rates by means-testing benefits or by withdrawing tax credits 
                      will decrease labour market participation, and that decreasing 
                      marginal tax rates by increasing universal benefits such 
                      as Child Benefit and by replacing means tested benefits 
                      and tax credits by universal benefits will increase labour 
                      market participation.</font></p>

                      is a pleasure to read an article which contributes such

                      the reduction of poverty and the efficiency of the economy.</font></p>

                      several articles of interest to readers of this Newsletter. 
                      Martin Seeleib-Kaiser and Timo Fleckenstein show how Germany's 
                      labour market policies have recently followed the UK into 
                      greater reliance on means-tested benefits, and suggest that 
                      this has happened because 'policy-makers &#133; did not 
                      have concrete blueprints for labour market reform' (p.444) 
                      available to them other than the UK model. Suzanne Moffatt 
                      and Paul Higgs show how non-uptake of means-tested benefits 
                      by elderly people exacerbates the gap between the richest 
                      and the poorest pensioners, and suggest that it is 'unlikely 
                      that, in the immediate future, many frail and vulnerable 
                      older people will be able to operate as successful consumers 
                      in the welfare market, since consumer citizenship for older 
                      people depends to a great extent on their resources and 
                      health' (p.462). Siobahn E. Laird explains how in sub-Saharan 
                      Africa management of the economy is not enough and that 
                      government involvement in welfare delivery is essential 
                      to social cohesion. Robert Maier, Willibrord de Graaf and 
                      Patricia Frericks offer a life-course perspective on pensions 
                      provision and ask for 'new pension systems that fit the 
                      present life course with all its variations and interdependencies' 
                      (p.501). Finally, Alina Gildiner takes Canada as an example 
                      of some of the effects of policy drift.</font></p>
