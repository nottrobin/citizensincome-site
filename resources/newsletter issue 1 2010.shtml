                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our 
                      review article about the rightly f&ecirc;ted book <i>The 
                      Spirit Level</i> asks that we go deeper into the causes 
                      of inequality than the authors have been able to do, but 
                      we can only applaud the book's message: that inequality 
                      matters, that why it occurs matters, that the damage that 
                      it does matters, and so seeking greater equality matters. 
                      But there has often been an understandable worry that social 
                      policy designed to create a more equal society might make 
                      the economy less efficient. Lilia Costabile's book on European 
                      social policy, also reviewed here, hasn't received anything 
                      like the publicity generated for and by <i>The Spirit Level</i>, 
                      but it is at least as important because it shows that social 
                      protection measures don't necessarily make an economy less 
                      efficient.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These 
                      books have important consequences for the debate on the 
                      desirability and feasibility of a Citizen's Income: We no 
                      longer have to regard economic efficiency and greater social 
                      equality as mutually exclusive: indeed, we can regard them 
                      as complementary and as mutually reinforcing. A social policy 
                      which promotes both should therefore be particularly welcome. 
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
                      is a General Election on the way, and it will soon be time 
                      to discuss some new directions. If all of our major political 
                      parties were to recognise and state that equality and economic 
                      efficiency can be mutually reinforcing, and that economic 
                      and social policy belong together, it could move us into 
                      a new era of the debate on the desirability of universal 
                      benefits. A Citizen's Income is one of those social policies 
                      which would promote both greater economic efficiency and 
                      greater equality. If the Citizen's Income Trust can help 
                      by contributing to the necessary debate, then we shall of 
                      course be very pleased to participate.<br>

                      a library, responded to numerous requests for information, 
                      and updated our website (which receives between 200 and

                      surveys of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, 
                      organized an essay prize, participated in conferences, submitted

                      evidence as a booklet), published a leaflet/poster for students, 
                      and run a seminar series. We have done all of this on a

                      would be interested in our readers' responses to a number 
                      of questions:</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our 
                      first question is: <i>During the past decade much of our 
                      activity has been reactive rather than proactive. Should 
                      we now be planning to be proactive? - that is, should we 
                      be creating opportunities for debate rather than waiting 
                      for them to present themselves?</i></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      little while ago the trustees developed a plan for a commission 
                      on the reform of the tax and benefits system and on a Citizen's 
                      Income as a particular reform option. The process would 
                      be to gather expert groups to tackle particular issues related 
                      to the feasibility, desirability and implementation of a 
                      Citizen's Income; to publish working papers; to consult 
                      on the working papers; to fill gaps in research which the 
                      consultation revealed; to hold a conference or conferences;

                      More than &pound;16 billion in means-tested benefits and 
                      tax credits currently goes unclaimed every year, and as 
                      many as four out of five low paid workers without children 
                      (1.2bn households) miss out on tax credits worth at least 
                      &pound;38 per week - a total of &pound;1.9 billion. Housing 
                      benefit, council tax benefit, child tax credit and pension 
                      credit are also particularly susceptible to underclaiming. 
                      Citizens Advice Chief Executive David Harker said: 'The 
                      government has made a serious commitment to eradicate child

                      billion of tax credits remain unpaid each year. &#133; The 
                      benefits and tax credits system is extremely complicated 
                      and the reasons people don't claim what they're due are 
                      complex, ranging from simply not knowing about the benefit 
                      concerned, to being put off by what can sometimes seem a 
                      very daunting process, to feeling that the amount they gain 
                      will be negligible.' For further details see <a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/press_office201022">www.citizensadvice.org.uk/press_office201022</a></font></p>

                      don't often give to a book a review article rather than 
                      a review, but this book is important, it has generated a 
                      significant amount of debate, it will prove to be significant, 
                      and it raises interesting questions which are well worth 
                      pursuing. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      authors are epidemiologists and they bring research tools 
                      normally applied to the study of how and why diseases spread 
                      in populations to the study of a broader range of social 
                      ills. The book is packed full of useful and interesting 
                      data. It would have contained more of it if more had been 
                      available, but the authors found that data on hierarchies 
                      of wealth and on educational attainment are less available 
                      for the whole range of countries they were studying than 
                      is data on income inequality (p.27), so income inequality 
                      comes to stand for inequality in general. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Richard 
                      Layard has shown in his book <i>Happiness </i>(2006) that 
                      as GDP rises happiness rises and then plateaus; and in this 
                      book Wilkinson and Pickett show that the same applies to 
                      life expectancy, health, and other social indicators. But 
                      whereas <i>between</i> wealthier societies average income 
                      makes little difference to the levels of social indicators, 
                      <i>within</i> societies a very different picture emerges: 
                      'Richer people tend, on average, to be healthier and happier 
                      than poorer people in the same society' (p.13). The researchers' 
                      main finding is that levels of income inequality and levels 
                      of social and health problems correlate very closely with 
                      each other (p.20), and they draw the conclusion that inequality 
                      <i>causes</i> a variety of social failings.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
                      this isn't just an exploratory work: it is a call to action. 
                      The authors have themselves set up a not-for-profit trust 
                      to disseminate their findings, deliver understanding of 
                      the connections that they have discovered, and promote action 
                      to reduce the inequality which they believe to be the root 
                      cause of social ills. The final part of the book is full 
                      of proposals for action: the kind of childcare we are now 
                      seeing in the Sure Start programme; employee ownership of 
                      companies; reductions in CEO pay; and changing tax and benefits 
                      policies ( - there ought to have been rather more on this 
                      because the authors themselves recognise that it is 'the 
                      most obvious way' to influence income differences (p.263)). 
                      A Citizen's Income gets a brief mention.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      importance of this book is that no longer will anybody be 
                      able to say the income inequality doesn't matter.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
                      so the questions which the book raises:</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Causality 
                      and paradigm shifts</i></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      particularly interesting question is that of causality. 
                      Many of the chapters contain discussions on how inequality 
                      and/or income inequality cause the levels of health and 
                      other social indicators: levels of trust, mental illness, 
                      life expectancy, infant mortality, obesity, educational 
                      performance, teenage pregnancy, murder rates, imprisonment 
                      rates and social mobility. The authors take income equality 
                      as a signal of a more general social inequality, and then 
                      treat that as the causal factor. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
                      David Hume suggests: 'When we look about us towards external 
                      objects, and consider the operation of causes, we are never 
                      able, in a single instance, to discover any power or necessary 
                      connexion; any quality, which binds the effects to the cause, 
                      and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other. 
                      We only find, that the one does actually, in fact, follow 
                      the other,' (Hume 2008, ch.1, &sect; iv). Owens 1992 and 
                      Sosa and Tooley 1993 are more recent treatments of the problematic 
                      notion of causality, and they, like Hume and the book under 
                      review (p.62), raise the question as to whether a coincidence 
                      of phenomena can ever lead to a proper conclusion that one 
                      action causes the other. They also raise the question as 
                      to whether we can even say what we mean by the word 'cause'. 
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
                      shall continue to employ the notion of cause in this article 
                      whilst recognising that we can't be sure what the term means 
                      or whether causality is operating between inequality and 
                      social ills - because, as Immanuel Kant suggests, without 
                      the notion of causality we find it impossible to reason 
                      about anything. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      subsequent question is this: If there is a correlation between 
                      income inequality and other social ills, then in which direction 
                      does causality operate? Are social ills the result of inequality, 
                      or is inequality the result of social ills? And what would 
                      it take to prove such a causal link? </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unfortunately 
                      the notion of proof is just as difficult as the idea of 
                      causality. Karl Popper (2002) suggests that science comprises 
                      a set of bold hypotheses which we can falsify but which 
                      we cannot prove. What we can do is seek evidence which supports 
                      a hypothesis and thus construct a cumulative argument. Thomas 
                      Kuhn (1970) shows how a paradigm shift occurs and coheres 
                      within scientific communities and thus forms the basis for 
                      further exploration. The book under review is a useful step 
                      along the way towards understanding how our society functions, 
                      and thus helps to build the foundations for a new paradigm. 
                      Further research on the different kinds of inequality (educational 
                      attainment, housing, social capital, income, power, relationships 
                      with powerful people, etc.) and on how they relate to each 
                      other, and also research on the extent to which a generalised 
                      'inequality' exists and relates to particular kinds of equality, 
                      will help to build such a new paradigm and provide an even 
                      firmer basis for further useful research. </font></p>

                      structures and processes</i></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      general inequality to which the particular inequalities 
                      belong, and with which the levels of social ills correlate, 
                      might in former times have been spoken of in terms of social 
                      class. This raises the issue as to whether underlying the 
                      different kinds of inequality is a fundamental social hierarchy. 
                      Here is another issue deserving further research. If there 
                      is such a social hierarchy then it might be that hierarchy 
                      which is the independent variable, and income inequality 
                      and other particular inequalities which are dependent variables 
                      alongside the social ills which the authors find to be related 
                      to them. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      authors have offered us a hypothesis: that income inequality 
                      causes social ills. I would like to take the argument one 
                      step further and offer an additional hypothesis: that a 
                      deep-seated social structure (which we might call a social 
                      class structure, but we shall need to revisit the meaning 
                      of that term if we are going to use it) is a causal factor 
                      in constructing social infrastructures (of education, income 
                      distribution, healthcare, community engagement, etc.) and 
                      that those infrastructures result in inequalities which 
                      correlate closely with each other.</font></p>

                      close correlation suggests that the structure of welfare 
                      provision causes income inequality. If the class structure 
                      of a society relates closely to the type of welfare regime 
                      then Esping-Andersen's categorisation supports the first 
                      line of the table representing the additional hypothesis. 
                      This suggests that income inequality is a <i>dependent</i> 
                      variable, and that the additional hypothesis might offer 
                      a useful description of causal links.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                      suspect that underlying different income inequality outcomes 
                      is the extent to which Esping-Andersen's regimes apply different 
                      rules to different groups within a society. Here the detail 
                      matters. The Department for Work and Pensions Tax Benefit 
                      Model Tables (<a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/tbmt.asp">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/tbmt.asp</a>) 
                      show that many households on low incomes experience marginal 
                      deduction rates of 95%, i.e., for every additional pound 
                      they earn they keep only 5p: whereas those who earn most 
                      keep 59p of every extra pound earned. Income inequality 
                      is bound to be the result. Thus in a liberal welfare regime 
                      which relies heavily on means-testing the structure results 
                      in increasing income inequality. It is such detailed consideration 
                      of the <i>structures</i> of welfare provision (for instance, 
                      of the different types of secondary school, their different 
                      admissions systems, and those systems' privileging of middle 
                      class behaviour) that might reveal the complex causal pathways 
                      which result in a correlation between income inequality 
                      and other social indicators.</font></p>

                      the end of ch.6 Japan and Russia are compared. The former 
                      has high income equality and good health indicators, the 
                      latter high income inequality and poor health indicators. 
                      The detail of the two examples suggests that a bundle of 
                      factors relating to economic and legal structures, history, 
                      and politics, might be the independent variables behind 
                      both income inequality and health outcomes, as the additional 
                      hypothesis suggests. Similarly, the evidence adduced for 
                      a statement on pp.168-9 that income inequality leads to 
                      lower social mobility suggests that it's feeling comfortable 
                      amongst people like ourselves which improves health and 
                      social outcomes, and when discussing educational performance 
                      the authors find that parents' educational attainments affect 
                      both household income and one's children's educational attainments. 
                      In a number of places the authors show how chemical factors 
                      (for instance, cortisol release when we are stressed, inhibiting 
                      our ability to think) affect social and health indicators. 
                      Such evident complexity supports the existence of the left 
                      hand column in the diagram of the additional hypothesis. 
                      There is a social hierarchy with complex roots; it is this 
                      which in different ways drives the structures of welfare 
                      provision; it is these structures which determine income 
                      inequality and other health and social indicators; and these 
                      inequalities in their turn reinforce the social hierarchy, 
                      thus creating a circular model, as shown in the diagram

                      authors' own discussion of possible causal routes on pp.188ff 
                      could lead us to the additional hypothesis outlined above, 
                      and it could also provide additional support for their listing 
                      of Citizen's Income amongst the actions for which they call. 
                      A Citizen's Income would redistribute income, and would 
                      thus be an action related to the authors' hypothesis; but 
                      it would also reduce marginal deduction rates and thus encourage 
                      low earners to earn more by enabling them to keep more of 
                      the additional money they would earn. It would therefore 
                      change for the better the structure of welfare provision, 
                      as the additional hypothesis requires. </font></p>

                      every social policy area, changing the structure of provision 
                      will change outcomes. For instance: to remove private schools' 
                      charitable status would reduce the numbers going to them, 
                      which would bring more bright middle-class children and 
                      their parents into the state system, which would improve 
                      state schooling, which would affect educational outcomes. 
                      To cease to allow voluntary aided schools to set their own 
                      admissions criteria would have a similar effect.</font></p>

                      the field in which we are most interested here, we need 
                      policy changes which will result in alteration to the <i>structure</i> 
                      of welfare provision as this would change the ways in which 
                      the system redistributes income. The one prescription would 
                      therefore satisfy the ways in which both of our hypotheses 
                      call for action. In this instance, changing only the symptom 
                      might make matters worse if additional means-testing is 
                      used to redistribute income, for that would only increase 
                      marginal deduction rates (as more benefits would be withdrawn 
                      as earned income rose) and would thus dig people deeper 
                      into poverty. In this, as in all other policy areas, it's 
                      the structure which requires attention as well as the symptom.</font></p>

                      has started an essential debate; and the publisher is to 
                      be congratulated on the book's production (though the index 
                      is incomplete, there is no bibliography, and the cartoons 
                      are a matter of taste).</font></p>

                      review is a contribution to the debate which now needs to 
                      happen. We look forward to seeing many more contributions 
                      to it. As the authors say, 'in the course of our research 
                      we became aware that almost all problems which are more 
                      common at the bottom of the social ladder are more common 
                      in more unequal societies' (p.18). Yes, indeed. So what 
                      needs changing is the length of the 'social ladder'. The 
                      more equalities we can introduce into our social infrastructure, 
                      the more the ladder will shorten, particularly for the next 
                      generation. Whilst a Citizen's Income on its own wouldn't 
                      complete that task, it would surely make a substantial contribution 
                      to it. </font></p>

                      indicators. What we now require is a broad debate about 
                      a) what the causal links might be; and b) what we should 
                      therefore do. </font></p>

                      Great Transformation</i> published originally in 1944, in 
                      which Polanyi charts the commodification of labour. 'Polanyi 
                      depicted the nineteenth century as an attempt to create 
                      a market society in which everything was turned into a commodity, 
                      driven by the rising power of financial capital' (p.3). 
                      'The early period was one of 'disembeddedness', in which 
                      financial and industrial capital broke down old systems 
                      of regulation, social protection and redistribution &#133; 
                      to create national markets, including a national labour 
                      market.' The disembedded phase lasted into the early twentieth

                      differences between work and labour, the differences between 
                      labour and labour power, and the concepts of employment, 
                      occupation, vocation, career, profession, crafts and job. 
                      Concepts imply the social contexts in which they take place. 
                      He relates leisure to work, and play to labour. 'Unlike 
                      labour, &quot;work&quot; captures the activities of necessity, 
                      surviving and reproducing, <i>and </i>personal development.' 
                      'In work, there is room and respect for inaction and contemplation.' 
                      He says that in ancient Greece 'reproductive activity, <i>praxis</i>, 
                      work done for its own sake, was a means of strengthening 
                      personal relationships, between relatives, friends and citizens'.

                      of the book is devoted to examining the decommodification 
                      and recommodification of labour in different time periods. 
                      The growing inequality has led to a new class system. (It 
                      has been suggested elsewhere that there are now two classes 
                      in the UK: citizen, and an underclass.) Standing distinguishes 
                      between the global elite, the salariat, the 'proficians' 
                      (a mix of professional and technician), a withering core 
                      of working class, the 'precariat', the unemployed, and the 
                      detached. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">He 
                      looks at the weakening of several former barriers to commodification, 
                      including the family and the education system. In the latter, 
                      he identifies the commodification of schooling and academics 
                      over the last three decades. Attitudes and policies towards 
                      the unemployed have commodified these, too. Commodification 
                      has taken place by undermining 'regulations protecting employees 
                      through labour law, unions and collective bargaining' (p.147). 
                      Occupations and crafts used to provide a barrier to commodification, 
                      but these too have suffered a 'loss of autonomy &#133; via 
                      attack from state bureaucrats, the courts, corporate tactics 
                      or divisions within the occupation'. Both state regulation 
                      and self-regulation of occupations provided barriers to 
                      commodification. Standing examines regulation, which is 
                      about control, and asks 'for whom, by whom, over what and 
                      by what means?'. Powerful trends towards occupational licensing 
                      are recommodifying many occupations.</font></p>

                      chapter 8, Standing draws together some of the social and 
                      labour consequences of the construction of The Global Transformation. 
                      He calls this 'The Horror'. This period is characterised 
                      by gross and growing inequality, gated communities of the 
                      rich, and social and economic insecurity for most. Also 
                      included is an increase in short-term jobs with long hours, 
                      loss of control, stress, increased surveillance, and the 
                      rise of the adjustment professions for damage limitation 
                      (psychiatrists, therapists, prescription drugs, social workers, 
                      and the police). The defining feature of globalization is 
                      insecurity.</font></p>

                      is a scholarly and erudite work, with a bibliography testifying 
                      to the breadth of reading by, and background knowledge of, 
                      the author. He also draws on his long experience working 
                      for the International Labour Organisation. It is not an 
                      easy book to read for the non-specialist. However, the work 
                      repays the effort of those who persist. The definition of 
                      terms made in chapter 1, the subtle distinctions in meaning, 
                      and the technical language make, demands on the reader. 
                      There is a wealth of detail, all illustrated with plenty 
                      of fascinating examples. At times, these can seem overwhelming, 
                      and the interesting detail of the trees can make one lose 
                      sight of where the path is leading through the wood. The 
                      goal is revealed in the last two chapters. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Standing 
                      recognises that the commodification phase of the Global 
                      Transformation, during which the building of international 
                      markets was paramount, must be followed by one where the 
                      economy must be re-embedded in society, to overcome the 
                      yawning inequality, stress, insecurity and loss of control. 
                      He argues that, from among the various forms of citizenship 
                      that are vying for supremacy, the desirable form is 'occupational 
                      citizenship'. He then describes the sort of institutions 
                      and policies that could lead to a future society based on 
                      occupational citizenship.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      first question for any social policy reform should be 'What 
                      sort of society do we want to be part of and help to create?' 
                      Standing recognises that a vision is required, in which 
                      <i>both</i> equality and freedom are goals. Some degree 
                      of equality is a necessary condition for freedom, because 
                      one cannot be truly free if living in poverty. Greater equality 
                      increases choice for more people. He defines 'full freedom' 
                      as the decommodification of people equally, but he recommends 
                      that their labour should be commodified, a good sold for 
                      a money wage. Necessary conditions for the 'Good Society' 
                      include good work relations (rather than good labour relations). 
                      It would also be characterised by identity and social solidarity. 
                      Civic friendship and conviviality will have a high profile. 
                      He favours a cap on incomes and wealth. He refers to Polanyi's 
                      concept of the right to non-conformity. He proposes five 
                      Decision Principles by which to evaluate policy proposals 
                      and institutional changes (pp.296-8), including an Ecological 
                      Constraint Principle as an over-riding requirement. </font></p>

                      is not until page 299 that Standing introduces the idea 
                      of a Basic Income. He extols its many advantages, and defends 
                      it against potential criticisms. By breaking the link between 
                      security and labour, it provides the security to facilitate 
                      a richer working life. He favours an end to subsidies as 
                      indefensible on efficiency and equity grounds. He explores 
                      in greater depth how such a basic income scheme could end 
                      paternalistic welfare policy, where a citizen's receipt 
                      of benefits has behaviour conditions attached. He also indicates 
                      how such a scheme would give people 'work rights', allowing 
                      them choices for how they use their time for contemplation, 
                      for leisure, or in socially useful ways. He recommends that 
                      there should be collective and individual Voice (associations 
                      for representation) for both recipients of care and for 
                      care-workers, and that the latter should have a collective 
                      body with both bargaining powers and lobbying functions 
                      (pp.315-21).</font></p>

                      the book, Standing is very critical both of social democrats 
                      of the twentieth century, who were mistaken, and of libertarian 
                      paternalists of the early twenty-first century, who claim 
                      to know what is best for others, and who are dangerous. 
                      He claims that a basic income scheme can be justified as 
                      an instrument of democratization. He also indicates how 
                      a basic income scheme is part of a move towards egalitarian 
                      freedom, and how emancipating egalitarianism is needed to 
                      create the basis of occupational citizenship. </font></p>

                      social security benefits, reduce an economy's efficiency? 
                      In particular, does the European Social Model make for economies 
                      less efficient than those in countries such as the USA where 
                      social protections are less well developed? To put the question 
                      another way: Is state-sponsored equality less economically 
                      efficient than free market inequality?</font></p>

                      A. B. Atkinson discusses Europe's rather loose system of 
                      social policy co-ordination and its consequences: low poverty 
                      in the Nordic countries, and higher ones in the UK, Ireland 
                      and Southern Europe. There are therefore pressures for more 
                      robust social protections, but in a globalising world there 
                      are contrary pressures to reduce them so that Europe's tax 
                      rates don't make its labour costs uncompetitive. Unfortunately, 
                      employment on its own does not ensure escape from social 
                      exclusion, as Munzi's and Smeeding's chapter shows. </font></p>

                      heart of the book's argument is in Bowles' and Jayadev's 
                      chapter, 'The Enforcement-Equality Trade-off'. They point 
                      out that 'guard labour' (supervision, policing, prisons, 
                      security personnel, etc.) costs money, and they show that 
                      in unequal societies we need more of it. Importantly they 
                      also show that there is more evidence for a correlation 
                      between social inequality and the costs of guard labour 
                      than there is for a trade-off between equality and economic 
                      efficiency. They recommend that more resources should be 
                      redistributed to the less well off to enable the costs of 
                      guard labour to be reduced.</font></p>

                      schemes, with which their costs should be compared; Costabile 
                      and Scazzieri show that the dollar's function as a reserve 
                      currency explains US economic dominance, and that expanding

                      all the various requirements placed on them by social security

                      report is limited in scope, in that it doesn't attempt to 
                      measure compliance costs, but it performs a most useful 
                      purpose: to explore 'the nature of the costs of compliance 
                      for claimants of benefits and tax credits; assesses whether 
                      such costs can be measured and, if so, to what extent; and 
                      discusses whether impact assessments of policy changes could 
                      include such measurements' (p.1).</font></p>

                      chief method studied is the allocation of monetary value 
                      to the time which employers and claimants expend on their 
                      relationships with the tax and benefits system; but it's 
                      not just claimants' time costs that the report discusses: 
                      it also recognises 'stigma, hassle, intrusion, stress, worry, 
                      fear &#133; uncertainty' and 'conditionality' as costs. 
                      Both quantitative and qualitative surveys and methods are 
                      therefore relevant.</font></p>

                      ever the Government undertakes a major review of income

                      1942 report was the last time this happened - then this 
                      report and the quantitative and qualitative surveys which 
                      we hope will flow from it will be important evidence. </font></p>

                      authors are right to suggest that a deeper understanding 
                      of compliance costs would contribute to more accurate calculation 
                      of the productivity of the benefits system, a better understanding 
                      of the reasons for non-take-up of benefits, and improved 
                      trust in government. We hope that the Government and others 
                      will follow the report's recommendations, and we look forward 
                      to seeing the outcomes of the research projects which will 
                      be the result. We also very much look forward to seeing 
                      the results of the current HMRC survey of the comparative 
                      costs of applying for child benefit and child tax credits 
                      (pp.42, 87). The evidence gathered will be useful to a future 
                      review of the tax and benefits system, particularly if a 
                      Citizen's Income is on its agenda.</font></p>

                      the extent to which they can be put into practice. 'Given 
                      that [the nine principles] have been a major plank in the

                      surprising that there has been little recent attention given, 
                      either in civil service or academic literature, to refining

                      (though they clearly have a filtering role and plenty of 
                      influence); and politicians are driven by short-term electoral 
                      considerations, the interests of influential stakeholders 
                      (such as the Murdoch press), and their own interests, and

                      UK, and in particular to implement a Citizen's Income. A 
                      Citizen's Income would serve well almost any conceivable

                      pensions in New Zealand and other countries; it would be 
                      innovative, flexible and creative, and would enhance people's 
                      ability to innovate, to work flexibly, and to be creative; 
                      it would be evidence-based (Child Benefit is the evidence); 
                      it would be inclusive (by definition); it would join up 
                      the different stages of people's lives, employment transitions, 
                      and many of the fissures in our society; it would be simple 
                      to review and to evaluate; and it would learn lessons from

                      from leisure time dedicated to consumption. The author's 
                      resistance to this dominant time culture involves 'the assertion

                      on to question the public / private distinction often employed

                      constraint, that governments should legislate for limits 
                      to time spent in employment, and that women should involve

                      she discusses policy options: for instance, paid parental 
                      leave for men not only gives them more time to do caring 
                      work but it also functions as a societal statement that

                      (such as that 'part-time employment should be treated as 
                      normal for both men and women' and that 'employment policies 
                      and pension entitlements should be based on the assumption 
                      that workers will normally want to work short hours or to 
                      take leave at various points in their life'), but it doesn't 
                      recognise that changes to the tax and benefits system might 
                      be needed in order to turn such ideas into practical policy.</font></p>

                      book will be of interest to anyone interested in the technical 
                      detail of funding mechanisms, and those not so inclined 
                      will still find plenty of thought-provoking material to 
                      explore; but there are one or two basic assumptions which 
                      readers might wish to question. For instance: S&ouml;derstr&ouml;m 
                      treats children as consumption choices made by adults (and, 
                      significantly, when discussing life phases in the context 
                      of pension provision he decides to reduce the life phases 
                      from four to three by omitting childhood (p.61)). This understanding 
                      of childhood, and the related concentration on pension provision, 
                      compromises the stated lifecycle approach of the book. Similarly: 
                      the cluster of income maintenance mechanisms is reduced 
                      to three: insurance, family, and state, with state provision 
                      restricted to filling gaps left by the other two. There 
                      is little sense that other patterns might be Pareto optimal, 
                      have low administrative costs, and be conducive to social 
                      justice. (In general, too little account is taken of administrative 
                      costs: an important frictional element in any social protection 
                      provision.)</font></p>

                      has wondered publicly whether he ought to have been more 
                      radical by recommending a higher basic state pension in 
                      order to keep more pensioners out of means-testing. This 
                      book might have been published ten years ago, but we are 
                      reviewing it in this edition because it is even more relevant 
                      now than it was then. It is a careful study of economic 
                      models and their application to the problem of funding pensions 
                      for an ageing population, and the lesson we draw from it 
                      is that Turner should indeed have been much more radical. 
                      The answer to the problem is not a larger contributory state 
                      pension but a universal pension. </font></p>

                      reducing birthrate and increasing longevity, leading to 
                      more elderly people dependent on fewer younger people. Chapter 
                      2 employs economic models to explore population growth, 
                      age structure, and social expenditure; chapter 3 uses Australia 
                      as an example to discuss the effects on projections of assumptions 
                      about real spending growth, productivity growth, unemployment, 
                      and labour market participation rates; and chapter 4 shows

                      chapter 5 Creedy begins his discussion of pensions and their 
                      financing by studying the variety of options available to 
                      governments; chapter 6 compares private savings and social 
                      transfers using a complex model which takes account of increasing 
                      longevity and changes in labour supply; chapter 7 studies 
                      state schemes and the ability to contract out of them; and 
                      chapter 8 finds that an earnings-related component creates 
                      positive employment incentives and raises average earnings 
                      compared to a flat-rate pension, but also that a flat-rate 
                      pension scheme can achieve higher social utility curves. 
                      Chapter 9 studies the wage-pension trade-off under a variety 
                      of pension schemes and discovers a rather complex picture; 
                      and chapter 10 begins the author's discussion of lifetime 
                      simulation models and finds that means-tested and universal 
                      systems result in similar lifetime inequalities, which means 
                      that removing the complexity of means-testing would not 
                      create greater inequality. Chapter 11 shows that means-tested 
                      state pension systems are a relative disincentive to private 
                      pension saving and that a universal scheme would make less 
                      optimal the kind of working age behaviour which results 
                      in lower retirement incomes. Similarly, chapter 12 finds 
                      that a universal pension would make optimal a higher retirement 
                      age than does a means-tested pension. </font></p>

                      social policy and the study of social policy, and it is

                      also central to the book is the question as to how we should 
                      understand the boundaries between political science, economics, 
                      social policy (and administration), sociology, public policy,

                      Europe or will it join a globalised race to the bottom?), 
                      and there are discussions of the ways in which we categorise 
                      people, of the politicisation of social policy, of the relationship 
                      between business and policy-making, and of the way in which 
                      international policy processes influence national processes. 
                      The final section studies 'practices' and contains discussions 
                      of the relationship between ethics, research, and policy, 
                      of user involvement, and of the 'translation' of policy 
                      from one context to another. The last chapter returns to 
                      the fundamental questions with which the book begins, and 
                      in particular asks what counts as social policy, what counts 
                      as evidence, and what is legitimate method (for all evidence 
                      and method is inevitably viewed from particular standpoints). 
                      The final chapter returns to the beginning of the book in 
                      another way too. It's about social policy and about the 
                      study of social policy, and it isn't sufficiently clearly 
                      structured to enable the reader to distinguish when it's 
                      about one and when it's about the other.</font></p>

                      but the authors are agreed that the meaning of every term 
                      is negotiable and that boundaries are there to be crossed 
                      ( - so it's a bit of a surprise that the first two sections

                      I were to choose just one discussion, then it would be that 
                      of categorisation of people in chapter 4: 'The extent to 
                      which any policy is able to reach its target population 
                      and stated goals crucially depends on the appropriateness 
                      of the categories chosen. Despite this, the political process 
                      of categorising ensures that theoretical and conceptual 
                      clarity are by no means central to the decisions made' (p.76). 
                      After reading this book, reducing to one the number of categories 
                      employed in the allocation of benefits looks like a really 
                      good idea.</font></p>

                      The chapters bear out the editors' view that 'the western

                      to the welfare state relate to different welfare regimes. 
                      Encouragingly, the editors also find 'strong evidence for

                      and appealing concepts of social justice will be needed

                      our first edition for 2008 we published a report on a conference 
                      held in October 2007 by the Foundation for Law, Justice 
                      and Society at the University of Oxford. The conference's 
                      title was <i>The Social Contract Revisited: The Modern Welfare 
                      State</i>, and the Foundation has now published some of 
                      the presentations and also a record and critical assessment 
                      of the sessions.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 
                      particular interest is Amitai Etzioni's <i>A Community-based 
                      Guaranteed Income</i> (meaning here a Citizen's Income). 
                      Etzioni suggests that we live on a variety of levels (individual, 
                      local community, national community &#133;.), that discussion 
                      of a Citizen's Income needs to relate to all of them, and 
                      that a community-based Citizen's Income could usefully complement 
                      means-tested benefits. In his critical assessment of the 
                      workshop, The Contract for Income Support and Pensions in 
                      the Modern Welfare State, Amir Paz-Fuchs asks 'What is the 
                      community and what are its boundaries?' (Paz-Fuchs, p.4), 
                      and suggests that Van Parijs's argument for a Citizen's 
                      Income on the basis of the real freedom which it would foster 
                      is more coherent than Etzioni's argument on the basis of 
                      our moral responsibility for each other in a community.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also 
                      of interest are Michael Opielka's <i>The Feasibility of 
                      a Basic Income</i> and Charles Murray's <i>Guaranteed Income 
                      as a Replacement for the Welfare State</i>. Opielka argues 
                      that a wage-centred welfare state is becoming less relevant 
                      and that increasing social inequality requires a solution. 
                      He discusses a number of possibilities: negative income 
                      tax, a Citizen's Income, a partial Citizen's Income, and 
                      a Citizen's Income scheme in which someone could choose 
                      a lower CI and a lower tax rate or a higher CI and a higher 
                      tax rate. Transitional arrangements are discussed, and finally 
                      a new category of welfare state: 'guarantism'. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Murray 
                      recommends a Citizen's Income on the basis that it would 
                      enable government to interfere less with people's lives 
                      and that it might encourage labour market participation 
                      by currently excluded groups, and he suggests that a Citizen's 
                      Income should replace existing welfare states (and, in particular, 
                      that people should pay their own compulsory health insurance 
                      premiums out of their Citizen's Income).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
                      the end of his critical assessment of the workshop Paz-Fuchs 
                      lists the distinctions which our current welfare system 
                      institutionalizes: </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">' 
                      &quot;deserving&quot; versus &quot;undeserving&quot;; able-bodied 
                      versus disabled; children versus adults versus elderly; 
                      married versus non-married; and so forth. The idea of a 
                      genuine basic income, discussion of which opened and closed 
                      the workshop, discards these divisions. That is one of its 
                      obvious appeals' (Paz-Fuchs, p.15).</font></p>

                      science sets off from axioms: a set of unproven, and generally 
                      unprovable, hypotheses. Since Adam Smith, neoclassical economic 
                      science has set off from a hypothesis of perfect competition 
                      in a free market in private property. This turns public 
                      economics into a science based on market failure. Private 
                      trades thus become the norm and government action in the 
                      economy becomes non-normative. This is clearly nonsense 
                      because without a functioning public square to create a 
                      structure of security, contract law, education, and health, 
                      private trades would become unreliable and economics as 
                      we understand it would no longer adequately model the chaotic 
                      situation which would ensue. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Richard 
                      Wagner suggests a different starting point. There are various 
                      ways in which we can generate orderly patterns of activity: 
                      by individual trades in private property, by individuals 
                      relating to each other through the collective property which 
                      constitutes the state, and by relationships through property 
                      held in common by members of an association. This view sees 
                      government action as a particular realm of orderly action 
                      and not as an interference in some other set of actions 
                      regarded as normative.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
                      axiom which the author questions is the market equilibrium 
                      which classical economic theory regards as normative. Wagner 
                      suggests that if public economics is a facet of social theorising 
                      (that is, if there is no clear boundary between economics 
                      and polity) then change generated by conflict between different 
                      social groups.becomes normative. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Following 
                      two chapters which provide an overview of Wagner's approach, 
                      the central chapters of the book understand society as constituted 
                      by 'political enterprises' which compete with each other 
                      for resources to enable them to undertake their chosen projects. 
                      Chapter 7 then explores multiple levels of government and 
                      the competing public squares which result. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      final chapter understands taxation and government spending 
                      as so complex that 'analytical coherence can be attained 
                      only through massive simplification in some form' (p.181). 
                      The theorems of traditional welfare economics represent 
                      precisely such a simplification. In the real world, political 
                      cultures and fiscal arrangements interact with each other 
                      and, in particular, we can't package utility into leisure 
                      and consumption as traditional labour market economics tries 
                      to do. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'To 
                      approach life through the organization of meaningful activity, 
                      as against approaching it hedonistically through consumption, 
                      is to seek to reconceptualise welfare in terms of the interesting 
                      and challenging adventures that different systems of economic 
                      order allow people to have during the course of their lives. 
                      Such an alternative formulation would, of course, deny that 
                      consumption is the end of economic activity, and would convert 
                      consumption into a by-product concomitant of that activity. 
                      A Society in which people are having interesting and creative 
                      adventures will flourish, and what we call high consumption 
                      will emerge as a by-product of the activities that flourishing 
                      represents' (p.195)</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
                      how people relate to each other and the competencies they 
                      are encouraged to develop are allowed to be factors in the 
                      construction of welfare economics, then, says Wagner:</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'A 
                      system of designated accounts over which people have ownership 
                      creates a relationship among equals. In contrast, existing 
                      social security programs involve relationships of domination 
                      and subordination, within which supplication becomes a standard 
                      mode of conduct' (p.196)</font></p>
