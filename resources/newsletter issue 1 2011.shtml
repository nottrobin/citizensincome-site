                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      concept of a Basic or Citizen's Income is virtually unknown 
                      in Iran. In nearly three years of discussion and debate 
                      over the government's new economic reforms, there has been 
                      no mention of it at all in political, academic or media 
                      circles. And yet, the country has just launched a nationwide 
                      cash transfer programme that has the hallmarks of a Basic 
                      Income in disguise. Some 60.5 million Iranians, or 81 percent 
                      of the population, have just had the first payment of 810,000 
                      rials (about US$80) per person deposited in their bank accounts. 
                      The payments will be made every two months, involve no means 
                      testing, and are unconditional. They are also likely to 
                      double in amount over the next few years as implementation 
                      proceeds. The remaining 19 percent of the population opted 
                      out of the programme voluntarily, mainly because they do 
                      not need the money. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remarkable 
                      as this is, the novelty does not end there. The tens of 
                      billions of dollars involved each year will not come from 
                      oil exports, or from government coffers. The transfers will 
                      be financed entirely through the higher prices the nation 
                      will henceforth pay for a variety of basic goods and services 
                      -- mainly fuel products -- that have been massively subsidised 
                      for decades. (Until now petrol has cost US$0.10 a litre 
                      and diesel fuel under $0.02.) The same applies to natural 
                      gas, electricity, water charges, and bread. Such subsidies 
                      have benefited the well-off far more than those with modest 
                      incomes (70 percent going to 30 percent of the population) 
                      and resulted in wasteful consumption of energy and foodstuffs, 
                      inadequate investment in new technology, and environmental 
                      pollution, not to mention smuggling to neighbouring countries. 
                      In order to put an end to this inefficient and unfair system, 
                      the 'Targeting Subsidies Law' of earlier this year mandates 
                      the gradual phase-out, over five years, of nearly all implicit 
                      and explicit price subsidies, to be replaced with regular 
                      cash transfers to households and various economic and social 
                      sectors. The scale of price increases are not yet known 
                      (as of mid-November 2010) but they are likely to be huge, 
                      in some cases severalfold. Official announcement is expected 
                      towards the end of November with new prices coming into 
                      effect immediately. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Interestingly 
                      enough, the universality and uniformity of cash grants came 
                      about without anybody really pushing for them or even wanting 
                      them, either from the government side that put forward the 
                      original plan, or from those opposed to the plan in the 
                      parliament who wanted it modified, if not scrapped. The 
                      intention was firmly to target the cash transfers on the 
                      less well-off sections of the population, the haggling being 
                      over whether the beneficiaries should be the lowest two, 
                      or five or seven deciles of the population on the income 
                      scale. The idea was also to pay more to those with lower 
                      incomes, in the interests of social justice. If in the end 
                      it was decided to pay the same amount to everyone who bothered 
                      to register, it was only because a massive exercise in means-tested 
                      targeting (over 17 million household questionnaires were 
                      filled out and analysed) turned into a fiasco as public 
                      protests mounted over the results. The principle of equal 
                      payment to all forced its way in because it just made sense 
                      under the circumstances. There could hardly be a more dramatic 
                      vindication of Philippe Van Parijs's characterisation of 
                      Basic Income as a 'simple and powerful idea'. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
                      be sure, Iran's 'cash subsidy' (that's the official designation) 
                      falls short of a fully-fledged Basic Income grant as commonly 
                      understood. The entitlements of all household members go 
                      to the head of the household alone, not to individual members, 
                      even if adult. There is no word on the duration of the programme, 
                      although it should in principle continue as long as Iran 
                      is able to produce oil for its domestic consumption. Means-tested 
                      targeting has not been abandoned altogether and may be resurrected 
                      if the government decides at some point that it can do a 
                      better job of targeting than its last attempt. The rights-based 
                      underpinnings of the Basic Income have no place in the current 
                      Iranian discourse on cash grants. The payments are not regarded 
                      as 'income' to which the citizens are entitled by right, 
                      but as another type of subsidy to compensate for the loss 
                      of price subsidies ( - though whether this makes any practical 
                      difference is an interesting question). Neither do they 
                      come anywhere close to a decent subsistence income ( - the 
                      US$200 which a family of five receive per month is about 
                      two-thirds of the monthly minimum wage). They also exclude 
                      more than two million Afghan and Iraqi refugees who have 
                      been living in Iran for years, sometimes decades, and will 
                      now have to bear the full brunt of price hikes. And last 
                      but not least, once price rises go into effect in the days 
                      ahead, and if inflation gets out of hand due to mismanagement, 
                      there is genuine fear that the whole edifice might come 
                      crashing down. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 
                      the other hand, it might be argued that the hardest obstacles 
                      towards a national Basic Income have already been overcome. 
                      The programme is enshrined in law. The payments are universal 
                      (except for those rich enough to forfeit their right by 
                      simply not signing up). Funding is assured and looks destined 
                      to continue in the medium term. And if the reforms succeed 
                      even partially in achieving their stated objectives of rationalising 
                      consumption patterns, boosting investment and efficiency, 
                      redistributing incomes in favour of the have-nots and reducing 
                      poverty, their future should be fairly secure. The continuation 
                      of the programme will also allow its shortcomings to be 
                      identified and put right, particularly if this enormously 
                      important shift in social policy is subjected to rigorous, 
                      comprehensive and continuing impact evaluation as it unfolds 
                      and progresses in the months and years ahead. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      replacement of price subsidies by a cash transfer system 
                      of unprecedented scope and scale has placed Iran in the 
                      forefront of all countries in advancing towards a nationwide 
                      Basic Income. The fact that such a transition takes place 
                      first in a developing, Middle Eastern, Islamic state, not 
                      in a developed country in Northern Europe as many had presumed, 
                      underlines the relevance of the concept of Basic Income 
                      for a broad range of countries. The specificities of the 
                      Iranian experience should of course not be ignored. It is 
                      in large part the combined availability of domestic fuel 
                      resources and an exceptionally distorted pricing policy 
                      that has made it possible, indeed almost inevitable, for 
                      a de facto Basic Income to emerge as part of the solution. 
                      But the model may still have some relevance for other countries, 
                      in particular mineral producing nations. There may also 
                      be scope in some countries with large subsidy bills to explore 
                      the feasibility and wisdom of rerouting subsidies to fund 
                      a Basic Income, without additional taxation. Iran's experience 
                      may hold some lessons of wider applicability, if they are 
                      properly drawn and are convincing. </font></p>

                      <b>Institute for Public Policy Research</b> has published 
                      the results of research which shows that 'in-work poverty 
                      has been on the increase over the last decade and this increase 
                      has not been dampened by the recession: The proportion of 
                      poor children living in working households increased to 
                      61 per cent in 2008/09, up from 50 per cent in 2005/06; 
                      there are now 1.7 million poor children in working households 
                      compared to 1.1 million in workless households; and the 
                      number of working-age adults in working households increased 
                      by 200,000 in 2008/09 and 60 per cent of poor adults now 
                      live in working households'. (p.1). IPPR says of the report: 
                      'Analysts had thought that the trend towards a greater proportion 
                      of poverty being found among working households might be 
                      reversed by the recession, as low earners lost their jobs 
                      and swapped in-work poverty for workless poverty. However, 
                      our analysis shows that this had not happened by March 2009 
                      and that in-work poverty continues to account for a rising 
                      share of poverty. This creates a key challenge for the Coalition 
                      Government as it sets out its plans for welfare reform and 
                      develops its child poverty strategy.' Recommendations include: 
                      'Increasing hourly pay; &#133;helping low earners to work 
                      longer hours; &#133;providing incentives for both partners 
                      in a couple to work; and &#133; increasing the value of

                      on all aspects of Citizen's Income, CI, including one or 
                      two symposia, (each symposium being a series of three linked 
                      papers), that aim to provide a coherent social policy in 
                      which a CI scheme provides a core, on the assumption that 
                      a CI is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a 
                      better society. A CI is an unconditional non-withdrawable 
                      income for every individual as a right of citizenship. It 
                      is granted on an individual basis: would be universal to 
                      everyone who has the right to legal permanent residence 
                      in the UK; is non-selective, except by age, and those with 
                      disabilities would continue to receive their disability 
                      benefits. It is delivered automatically to those who qualify.

                      income tax system. If a realistic but feasible CI scheme 
                      were in place, that aimed to redistribute from wealthy to 
                      poor sections of society, to reduce poverty, and to restore

                      2010, &pound;19.75) identified two significant problems

                      the benefits and Tax Credits (TCs) have to be claimed from 
                      up to four different agencies, (Jobcentre Plus, and The 
                      Pension, Disability and Carers Service, both within the

                      the extremely high Marginal Deduction Rates (MDRs), arising 
                      from the interaction of the deduction of income tax and 
                      National Insurance contributions with the application of 
                      several separate tapers (benefit withdrawal rates). Some 
                      benefit claimants can find themselves facing an MDR as high 
                      as 95.95%, which acts as an inbuilt deterrent to entering 
                      or increasing paid-employment. </font></p>

                      white paper proposes two key improvements. The first is 
                      the replacement of four out-of-work benefits and two in-work 
                      benefits by a 'Universal Credit' (UC), based on similar 
                      rates to the benefits that it replaces. The four benefits 
                      that are being replaced are Income Support (IS), income-based 
                      Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA), income-related Employment and 
                      Support Allowance (ESA), and Housing Benefit (HB). The in-work 
                      benefits are Working Tax Credit (WTC) and Child Tax Credit 
                      (CTC). The second improvement is the combination of several 
                      benefit tapers into a 'Single Unified Taper' of 65% on net 
                      earnings, thereby reducing the MDR to 65% on incomes below 
                      the income tax and NI thresholds, and about 76% above them, 
                      until the benefit entitlement is exhausted.</font></p>

                      <br>
                      Since a Citizen's Income (CI) scheme is a set of instruments 
                      rather than a program of policies, (although we believe 
                      that the instruments that comprise the CI will lead to benign 
                      outcomes), one can assess a policy proposal by comparing 
                      the features of that proposal with those of a CI scheme. 
                      Thus, in Table 2 below, the main features of any benefit 
                      and income tax system are listed in column 1, the elements 
                      of the current system that it is proposed be replaced are 
                      detailed in column 2, and the key aspects of the DWP proposal 
                      is given in column 3, while the main features of a CI are

                      It is obvious from the white paper that the whole impetus 
                      for these reforms is to get people off benefit and back 
                      into paid work. The government hopes that the reduction 
                      of the MDR from nearly 96% for some claimants, to 65% for 
                      those with incomes below the income tax and NI thresholds, 
                      and about 76% for those with incomes above these thresholds, 
                      will be a sufficient incentive for many who are out-of-work 
                      to seek work, and those suffering from in-work poverty to 
                      increase their earnings. </font></p>

                      wage of &pound;207.55. The first &pound;124.18 will attract 
                      an MDR of 65%, yielding a net amount of &pound;43.46, and 
                      the remaining &pound;83.37 will be subject to 76%, leaving

                      a total of &pound;63.47, representing an average net wage 
                      of &pound;1.81 per hour, with an average MDR of 69%. It 
                      is not surprising that a stiff regime of conditionality 
                      and sanctions, and thus of expensive monitoring, has to 
                      be in place to enforce this incentive. </font></p>

                      rate tax-payers. This makes the system highly regressive

                      participation in paid work. The equating of society with 
                      paid-work reveals the government's attitude to society, 
                      which does not augur well for David Cameron's idea of The 
                      Big Society. </font></p>

                      A joint application has to be made, and the benefit is paid 
                      to one partner. An extreme case occurs when a spouse, usually 
                      but not exclusively a woman, with caring responsibilities 
                      for children or disabled or otherwise infirm people, is 
                      financially dependent on a partner who is wealthy enough 
                      not to be eligible for a UC. As the Social Security law 
                      stands, cohabiting partners of all categories are required 
                      to support each other, but it could be 'in-kind', and does 
                      not have to be in the form of cash. However, despite ubiquitous 
                      references to 'the common purse', a financially dependent 
                      partner even in a formal union does not have legal rights 
                      to an income from the wealthier partner. The redress for 
                      this is an important part of a Citizen's Income. A further 
                      aspect of this repressive attitude to couples is that they 
                      receive less than that of two single people, thus further 
                      penalising them, and sometimes driving them apart.<br>

                      to permanent residence in the UK. Paradoxically, if a universal 
                      CI system were adopted, and income tax expenditures (which 
                      subsidise the richer part of society) were rescinded, then 
                      the MDR could have been much less, certainly no more than

                      changes detailed in the white paper, though welcome as far 
                      as they go, are not radical, since they merely remove some 
                      of the accretions that have been bolted on to earlier versions 
                      of the system, usually in the name of radical reforms. It 
                      is still the same non-universal, means-tested system, with 
                      claimants lumped together as households, thus retaining 
                      the concept of a 'financially dependent adult', and in which 
                      a significant section of society is excluded on the basis 
                      of her/his relationship with a wealthier person, from whom 
                      they have no rights to an income. Couples are still penalised, 
                      and the system can add to their problems, driving them apart. 
                      Too many adults and children will still live in poverty. 
                      As is well known, means-tested benefits almost always involve 
                      inherent high disincentives to work, which in turn lead 
                      to the imposition of conditionality and sanctions. The system 
                      is still regressive, and tax expenditures still subsidise 
                      tax-payers. It is a pity that the opportunity for really 
                      radical new thinking, in the form of a Citizen's Income, 
                      presented by the need to reduce the public deficit drastically, 
                      was not seized, to try to rectify many of these other aspects 
                      of the current system.<br>

                      concept of need is at least as complex as the human experiences 
                      to which we apply it, and this book brings some valuable 
                      order to the ways in which the term is used by policy makers 
                      and social scientists.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      first substantive chapter (ch.2) understands 'inherent' 
                      need as needs which belong to every human being simply by 
                      virtue of our being human - and straightaway we are into 
                      a variety of ways of understanding need because the different 
                      ways in which we understand our human nature result in different 
                      understandings of inherent need. If we understand ourselves 
                      as utilitarian subjects then our needs will be understood 
                      as objective interests; if we understand ourselves as market 
                      actors, then our needs will be understood as subjective 
                      preferences; if we understand ourselves as psychological 
                      beings, then our needs will be understood as inner drives; 
                      and if we understand ourselves as members of a species, 
                      then we will understand our needs as (evolved) constitutive 
                      characteristics. Social policy is about the meeting of need, 
                      so how we understand need matters, which means that how 
                      we understand ourselves as human beings matters rather a 
                      lot. </font></p>

                      Dean recognises that all need is to some extent interpreted, 
                      he gives chapter 3 to 'interpreted need' as a concept: that 
                      is, to understandings of need drawn from our experience 
                      of society and its culture. All understanding of need is 
                      culturally specific, so, for instance, in our consumer society 
                      consumerism generates our understanding of need. Social 
                      policy relates to need as we understand it, and so to normative 
                      (i.e., expert-defined), felt, expressed and comparative 
                      needs, with their respective discovery methods: for instance, 
                      participatory methods for discovering expressed needs.</font></p>

                      4 and 5 discuss poverty in terms of unmet need, inequality 
                      as a risk that some people's needs might not be met, social 
                      exclusion as exclusion from needs satisfaction, capabilities 
                      as the extent to which people are free to meet their needs, 
                      and 'recognition' as the extent to which people's needs 
                      are recognised. A tension underlying each discussion is 
                      that between the individuals' autonomy and our interdependency 
                      within society, and the related question: To what extent 
                      are my needs purely my own, and to what extent generated 
                      by and understood within our societal relationships?</font></p>

                      this context Dean explores in chapter 6 what he clearly 
                      regards as a crucial distinction: that between 'thin' and 
                      'thick' needs. Whilst a variety of expressions are given 
                      to this distinction, underlying all of them is the distinction 
                      between need as individual and need as social; and much 
                      of the rest of the book is taken up with exploring this 
                      distinction through discussion of differing theoretical 
                      standpoints.<br>
                      Chapter 7 develops a fourfold taxonomy of need constructed 
                      from the two main distinctions so far discussed: that between 
                      inherent and interpreted needs and that between thin and 
                      thick needs. Each resulting quadrant gives rise to a different

                      8 explores the ways in which needs are understood to imply 
                      rights. Dean develops another fourfold taxonomy based on 
                      the distinction between 'doctrinal' (or normative) rights 
                      and claims-based (asserted) rights and the distinction between 
                      understanding ourselves as autonomous subjects (thin needs) 
                      and as potentially vulnerable and therefore interdependent 
                      subjects (thick needs). Each quadrant generates rights understood 
                      in particular ways: for instance, doctrinal rights and an 
                      understanding of the person as vulnerable generate citizenship 
                      rights based on needs understood as universal. Dean then 
                      shows how each of Esping-Andersen's welfare regime types 
                      prefers a particular category of rights: liberal welfare 
                      regimes selective rights, conservative regimes protective 
                      rights, social democratic regimes citizenship rights, and 
                      all of them conditional rights: and he offers a detailed 
                      critique of the 'welfare citizenship' to which social democracy 
                      has given birth.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                      the final chapter Dean suggests that 'our humanity depends 
                      &#133; on social engagement and self-fulfilment' and that 
                      this implies universal and unconditional approaches to social 
                      policy and the meeting of both particular and common needs. 
                      His particular policy proposal is local social rights councils, 
                      but it could equally well have been a Citizen's Income, 
                      which does of course meet both particular and common needs 
                      as well as promoting both social engagement and self-fulfilment.

                      The book contains summaries and questions for discussion

                      There is an index, though unfortunately a flawed one: Bill 
                      Jordan is frequently quoted and is in the index; Fitzpatrick 
                      is also frequently quoted but isn't. Basic/Citizen's Income 
                      gets a brief mention on p.136, but you wouldn't know that 
                      from reading the index. </font></p>

                      the index is a minor blemish on an important book: important 
                      because it lays an essential foundation for any future discussion 
                      of social policy and thus for any future discussion of universal 
                      benefits.</font></p>

                      and close regulation of our collective life, to achieve 
                      social ends. Jordan's thesis throughout this carefully argued 
                      and quietly passionate book is that means need to cohere 
                      with ends: that is, that social and moral means are needed 
                      if moral and social ends are to be achieved; and that therefore 
                      individualistic market-oriented policies will struggle to 
                      deliver a sustainable and moral society. Under New Labour 
                      'the collective processes at work in every society' were 
                      submerged beneath an emphasis on 'individuals, their choices, 
                      aspirations, and achievements'. What is now needed is a 
                      return to a social order understood as 'a moral order of 
                      interdependent members giving each other mutual recognition'

                      the first part of his book Jordan outlines institutional 
                      arrangements which would enable 'justice, equality, wellbeing, 
                      respect and [a] sense of membership' (p.18) to flourish: 
                      lower benefits withdrawal rates, localism within a context 
                      of broader solidarities, and an openness to scientific advances. 
                      The second part of the book tackles the malaise into which 
                      New Labour stumbled: a reliance on contracts to solve social 
                      problems, and consumer choice. Jordan shows why contracts 
                      between a government and the commercial sector rarely work 
                      out as planned, and that consumer choice is rarely that. 
                      Underlying these particular problems was a touching faith 
                      in capitalism's ability to solve social problems, and in 
                      a rather dessicated economic logic. The proper role of economic 
                      science is as a tool in the cause of judgements made on 
                      the basis of moral regulation by social relationships constituted 
                      by ritual and symbol, and Jordan shows how New Labour failed 
                      to understand this. </font></p>

                      a Citizen's Income to rebalance formal and informal work, 
                      and radical devolution of public services. He concludes 
                      that both contractual and moral regulation are required, 
                      and calls for 'a heightened awareness of broader common 
                      interests and a recognition of fellow citizens' (p.200).</font></p>

                      It is carefully argued - for instance, discussing in detail 
                      &#142;i&#158;ek's doubts about a Citizen's Income; it is 
                      timely, because as well as offering a critique of the Third

                      and it is gently inspiring, because it shows how a combination

                      parties, which means that it has the potential to generate

                      in several ways: through the effect on household income 
                      and socio-economic circumstances (economic or financial

                      (cultural capital); and through family relationships and 
                      interaction (social capital). Parents' qualifications (human 
                      capital) also play an important part, and are related to 
                      levels of both economic and cultural capital' (p.3). The 
                      second chapter studies this 'capital' approach and also

                      outcomes for children, using existing data sets. The following 
                      three chapters present analyses of the data on young people's 
                      educational and emotional wellbeing. Both workless households 
                      and lone parents in full-time employment are shown to have 
                      negative effects on young people's emotional wellbeing; 
                      parental employment patterns and having a mother in part-time 
                      (but not full-time) employment correlate with lower truancy 
                      rates; and, interestingly, maternal employment patterns 
                      make no difference to achievement at GCSE whereas paternal 
                      unemployment has a negative effect. As expected, parents'

                      provided by this research tentatively supports the policy 
                      of encouraging paid work for all, including mothers, although 
                      part-time as opposed to full-time maternal employment might 
                      offer young people greater protection against poorer emotional 
                      well-being. Parental employment which guards children against 
                      the experience of household worklessness would appear to 
                      be overwhelmingly positive' (p.195). 'In moving away from 
                      a climate where any employment of a mother which separated 
                      her from a young child was frowned upon, there should not 
                      be a swing to a situation where full-time continuous employment

                      major long-term threat to classical capitalism is the devaluation 
                      of both capital and labour: capital investment in internet-based 
                      media is rarely profitable because it is difficult to demand 
                      payment for information which can be so easily shared; and 
                      technological change means that the 'global demand for labour 
                      is in long-term decline' (p.56). Insecurity for both investors 
                      and workers is the result. Governments' concern to maintain 
                      growth leads to government policy designed to maintain corporate 
                      profits - for instance, the privatisation of state enterprises 
                      and assets - in a context in which the increasing costs 
                      of the scarce resources of a finite planet and growing public 
                      resistance to consumption increasingly constrain growth. 
                      An important source of the funds with nowhere to go is the 
                      private pensions industry, which Shutt compares unfavourably 
                      with the state pay-as-you-go pension system: a system which 
                      he rightly suggests doesn't suffer from a rising dependency 
                      ration between retired workers and active workers because 
                      productivity is rising. The pharmaceutical, nuclear power 
                      and arms industries are castigated as yet more artificial 
                      receptacles for investment capital. The profits system, 
                      far from allocating resources efficiently, <i>mis</i>allocates 
                      them.<br>

                      proposed replacement economic model abandons both growth 
                      and the 'work fetish' (p.99) as priorities and instead aims 
                      'to provide people with what they need and want to the maximum 
                      extent permitted by the available resources' (p.108). The 
                      policy instruments proposed are greater government control 
                      over taxation and capital movement, increased non-profit 
                      and state ownership of enterprises, restriction of working 
                      hours, and a Citizen's Income. The final chapters recommend 
                      'cooperation, creativeness, equality' and 'deepening democracy' 
                      and ask whether the current crisis might lead some world 
                      leaders to seek a more radical alternative to the status

                      the final chapter Shutt returns to an anti-globalisation 
                      agenda which emerges at various points in his book, and 
                      I wonder whether here he has not sufficiently examined the 
                      options. National boundaries are contingent realities, and 
                      there is no more reason for recommending a new economic 
                      order founded on the nation state than a global one. What 
                      surely matters is consistency, e.g., the free movement of 
                      capital within Europe needs to be matched by a European 
                      tax regime and a European Citizen's Income. Further exploration 
                      of the alternatives would be welcome. <br>

                      of Shutt's readers will want to argue with particular points, 
                      but it is surely more important to experience the general 
                      direction of his argument. Whilst his agenda appears radical, 
                      he doesn't in fact attempt to dismantle capitalism. In spite 
                      of the rhetoric, what he's done is to show how capitalism 
                      can survive in a new context. One of those contexts is globalisation, 
                      and we look forward to Shutt showing how his prescription 
                      could work in an increasingly interconnected world.<br>

                      my book <i>The Future of Money</i> I argue that the money 
                      system could be a possible mechanism for achieving a socially 
                      just, democratically administered, sufficiency economy - 
                      an economy that can meet people's material needs to the 
                      minimum necessary to enable a high quality of life for all. 
                      A major proviso is that even radical reform of the money 
                      system will not eliminate private profit-oriented ownership 
                      and control of economic resources, but it could provide 
                      a stepping stone to a more ecologically sustainable and 
                      socially just society. While money can be a source of greed, 
                      alienation and exploitation it is also a symbol of social 
                      trust between people. 'Sound money' is a product of society, 
                      not of market forces. When we say people trust in money 
                      they are trusting in the organisations, society and authorities 
                      that create and circulate it, other people, traders, the 
                      banks and the state. What has also become clear in the recent 
                      financial crisis, is that the only mechanism that stands 
                      behind the current money system is the state as representing 
                      the collective economic resilience of the population. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Classical 
                      economics tells us that money emerged spontaneously out 
                      of barter markets when a precious commodity (gold/silver) 
                      was adopted as a medium of exchange. This became embedded 
                      in coin and represented by paper. This has been discredited 
                      by the fact that banking and accounting emerged thousands 
                      of years before precious metal coinage and coin value rarely 
                      equated to precious metal content. The origin of money is 
                      much more social. Money in all its forms has been issued 
                      or administered by fiat, that is, issued and guaranteed 
                      by an authority, such as a powerful leader, an office-holder 
                      or a religious organisation. Historically, states or other 
                      monetary authorities have used their power to establish 
                      the circulation of money as accounting records or as physical 
                      tokens such as clay tablets, tally sticks or coin by 'buying' 
                      goods and services. Why should people give up their labour, 
                      goods or resources for a worthless accounting record, tablet, 
                      stick or coin? Because the 'money' must be returned as tax. 
                      Even people not directly subject to state 'purchase' are 
                      also required to pay taxes, so the money-tokens must circulate 
                      widely in the economy. Taxation must also not reclaim all 
                      the 'money' otherwise there would be no mechanism for general 
                      circulation. The state must therefore always be in deficit, 
                      an important lesson for today's advocates of a balanced 
                      budget. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                      modern economies, the state's historic monetary role has 
                      been virtually obliterated. Money has been privatised through 
                      the issue of money through banks as debt, so much so that 
                      states have to borrow money themselves. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      modern banking system brings together private banking in 
                      relation to trade and the currency-creating powers of the 
                      state. Early commercial bankers issued their own credit 
                      notes, but as money issue and banks became more regulated, 
                      the money the banks issued was declared legal tender, that 
                      is universally recognised money authorised by the state. 
                      It is this combination of the public nature of money (national 
                      tender) and the privatisation of its issue and circulation 
                      that has created a money system based on private profit 
                      and public responsibility. As banks are issuing new money 
                      designated in the national currency, they are issuing what 
                      is, or should be, <b>a national resource</b>. Certainly 
                      they are issuing money that carries a public liability as 
                      is clear from the recent financial crisis. Even when money 
                      was deposited within another banking system (as in the case 
                      of the Icelandic banks), default became the responsibility 
                      of the British state. Equally, the Icelandic people, through 
                      the state, were forced to take on financial liabilities 
                      that were created by their private sector banks. If conventional 
                      economics and neoliberal ideology tells us that money is 
                      a private matter, the stampede of people towards a government 
                      guarantee of bank deposits in the event of default tells 
                      us otherwise. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Like 
                      states, banks issue money by fiat, out of fresh air. Although 
                      it is widely assumed that banks use savers' deposits to 
                      make loans, albeit on an expanded fractional reserve basis, 
                      this does not explain where the savers got their money from 
                      in the first place. As with state money, bank money must 
                      be issued before it is saved. <b>The first loan must come 
                      before the first deposit</b>. Far from money representing 
                      prior market activities as the barter theorists claimed, 
                      it is the prior issuing of bank credit that is essential 
                      to bringing profit-seeking activities into being. Issuing 
                      money as debt also demands constant growth and expansion 
                      of the economy. Capitalism would collapse if everyone paid 
                      their debts, or if no further debts were taken out. Anyone 
                      who takes on debt is therefore creating new money. Those 
                      who take on debt are also making vital choices about the 
                      direction of the economy and, as the financial crisis reveals, 
                      those choices can rebound on society as a whole. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      money system is a national resource that should not be appropriated 
                      for private profit. This is important because the ability 
                      to issue money in a society creates the ability to define 
                      what is to be seen as valuable (in money terms). Letting 
                      the market harness the allocation of money has prevented 
                      the recognition of value created by the environment, non-market 
                      activities and public investment. Allocating money to citizens 
                      as of right or to public investment would give a completely 
                      different message about what is important in society. Instead 
                      of money circulating through the market to create 'wealth' 
                      which is then taxed (under much protest) for public use, 
                      <b>public benefit</b> would be the basis for the allocation 
                      of money. Administration via a public money system would 
                      avoid both the rigidity of a command and control economy 
                      and the speculative exploitation, waste and inequality of 
                      a capitalist market. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Security 
                      of money allocation for consumption and production would 
                      remove much of the need to undertake unnecessary work and 
                      enable people to be confident of a sufficiency of material 
                      goods with more emphasis on the quality of life. Overall 
                      priorities would also put public welfare first (hospitals, 
                      education, transport) which would make people feel more 
                      secure about their future. This would mean they did not 
                      have such a need to accumulate money savings. The problem 
                      with aiming to achieve future security in money terms is 
                      that there is no way people can know what their money will 
                      buy in the future. While sufficiency can be calculated in 
                      real terms (how much bread will I need?), there is no basis 
                      for sufficiency in money terms (what will bread cost in 
                      thirty years' time?). Returning the money system to the 
                      public would be an invaluable step towards creating a socially 
                      just and ecologically sustainable sufficiency economy.</font></p>

                      everyone. The wealthy are paying far more in tax than they

                      to administer and suggest that they turn both tax allowances 
                      and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions' Universal 
                      Credit into a universal benefit and give it to us to administer.
