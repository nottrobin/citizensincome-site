                We are sorry to have to announce the death of Evelyn McEwen, Chair 
                of Trustees of the Citizen's Income Trust. An obituary will appear 
                in the next edition of the newsletter.<br>
                Apologies: <br>
                In April of this year the Citizens Income Trust sent a number 
                of invoices to people and organizations to which they should not 
                have been sent. The Trust would like to apologise for this mistake. 
                <br>
                It would also appear that some people and organizations who have 
                paid subscriptions have not received the first edition of the

                The world is changing.</b> <br>
                In an article titled &quot;Whatever happens, the process will 
                be painful&quot; (The Guardian, Monday 2nd July 2001), Larry Elliott 
                discusses whether or not we should regard the technological changes 
                we have seen this century as constituting a fifth 'Kondratiev 
                wave', and precisely where we might be within that wave. He concludes 
                that &quot;as far as organizational changes - to work patterns, 
                to politics, to institutions, to ways of thinking about problems 
                - are concerned, we have yet to make a start. That, more than 
                anything else, is the reason the birth-pangs of the fifth Kondratiev 
                wave look like being long and painful.&quot;<br>
                The political world is changing.<br>
                For the first time, we have a Labour government with a second 
                full term ahead of it. This offers the possibility, though by 
                no means the certainty, that the government will take the opportunity 
                to seek radical solutions to long-standing problems - solutions 
                which draw on a variety of elements within the party's heritage.<br>
                And regular readers will realize from the side panel that a few 
                things have changed at the Citizen's Income Trust. Stuart Duffin, 
                Carolyn Armstrong and Duncan Burbidge have all left the Trust's 
                employment, and we would like to thank them for the work they 
                have done for the Trust - in Carolyn Armstrong's case, for over 
                ten years; and the office at the London School of Economics has 
                closed (though the email address remains the same for the time 
                being). The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust has been funding 
                the Trust for nearly ten years, and we would like to thank them 
                for their generosity. That funding has now come to an end. <br>
                Malcolm Torry (who was Director of the Trust in the early 1990s) 
                has been appointed the new Director, the office has relocated, 
                and a draft strategy for the next five years is being discussed 
                (further details in the next issue).<br>
                What has not changed is the definition of a Citizen's Income: 
                it is an unconditional, non-withdrawable income payable to each 
                individual as a right of citizenship. And what has not changed 
                is the Citizen's Income Trust's commitment to the promotion of 
                debate on the feasibility of a citizen's income.</p>

                Why does Basic Income thrill the Finns, but not the Swedes? <br>
                By Jan Otto Andersson</b><br>
                Basic income is a fascinating idea. People tend to react strongly, 
                either looking upon it as a pivotal liberating device or showing 
                open disregard for it. In two of the Scandinavian countries - 
                Denmark and Finland - the idea of an unconditional basic income 
                has received much attention. However, in Sweden and Norway it 
                has almost been a non-issue. To compare the theoretical and political 
                debates in Finland and Sweden is therefore a means to look at 
                the differences between these two closely related societies.<br>
                The term most widely used in the Scandinavian countries is 'citizen's 
                wage' (medborgarl&ouml;n, kansalaispalkka). In Finland the terms 
                'basic income' (grundinkomst, perustulo) and 'citizen's income' 
                (medborgarinkomst, kansalaistulo) have also received a wide circulation. 
                <br>
                To use the term 'citizen's wage' adds to the provocation. How 
                can you speak of a 'wage' when you automatically receive a sum 
                of money even though you do not work or even do not pretend to 
                work! The reason given by the supporters - like Erik Christensen 
                from Denmark in a recent fascinating study (the title in English 
                would be &quot;Citizen's Wage. Stories about a Political Idea&quot;) 
                - is that they want to alter the dominant work concept. A citizen's 
                wage can be viewed as a compensation for all the unpaid but socially 
                necessary activities contributed by citizens. <br>
                In a speech to the unemployed a similar view was expressed by 
                the then Archbishop of Finland, John Vikstr&ouml;m:<br>
                &quot;A basic income would send every citizen the following encouraging 
                and motivating message: You are important. You are not a burden, 
                but a resource. You are important by being a human being for others. 
                Whatever work you do, in whatever situations, whether or not you 
                are paid to do it, you still contribute to building our society.&quot;<br>
                The provocative term has also made it possible for the opponents 
                to use it in a derogatory way: &quot;Work or Citizen's Wage?&quot; 
                is the title of a report presented by the Confederation of Finnish 
                Industry and Employers, although it did not relate to any genuine 
                proposal for a basic income. <br>
                The differences between Swedish and Finnish basic income debates 
                can be seen both in the intellectual debates and in the activities 
                of the political parties. Another telling difference is that at 
                the biannual meetings of the Basic Income European Network (BIEN) 
                the participation from Finland has been regular, whereas Swedish 
                representation has been almost negligible. <br>
                Lack of enthusiasm in Sweden<br>
                Three authors have actively proposed some version of a basic income 
                in Sweden: Gunnar Adler-Karlsson at the end of the 1970s, Thomas 
                Ehrenberg ten years later, and Lars Ekstrand in the 1990s. Both 
                Ehrenberg and Ekstrand wrote as if the idea had never been introduced 
                in Sweden before. <br>
                It is telling of the political climate in Sweden that Adler-Karlsson 
                had to accept a change of the title of his book from No to full 
                employment. Yes to a material basic security to the less offensive 
                Thoughts on full employment. In the Danish edition the original 
                title was used.<br>
                All three proposals were put forward in a futuristic and utopian 
                manner. They saw a citizen's wage (CW) as a means to radically 
                transform society, but were relatively short in the analysis of 
                which trends and forces would actually work in favour of their 
                visions. Adler-Karlsson's and Ekstrand's ideas did receive some 
                attention, but they were generally dismissed. I have found no 
                response to Ehrenberg's book.<br>
                As headlines such as &quot;He dreams of a citizen's wage&quot; 
                and &quot;The apostle of laziness provokes&quot; indicate, the 
                reception of Ekstrand's books was not enthusiastic. His views 
                were criticised by a leading authority on social policy, Gunnar 
                Wetterberg, head of the powerful central organisation for the 
                municipalities. Wetterberg called the idea &quot;the triumph of 
                resignation&quot;. In another article Wetterberg repeated his 
                critique under the ominous heading &quot;A citizen's wage would 
                feed the underworld&quot;.<br>
                In Sweden the only political party that has been seriously interested 
                in a CW is the Green party, Milj&ouml;partiet. In 1997 Eva Go&euml;s 
                asked the government to make an official report on the question. 
                <br>
                The Social Democrats have been the main defenders of the existing 
                system, based on the idea of full employment and a general system 
                of income-related social security. The Left party has also discarded 
                the CW idea, but it has asked for substantial reductions in working 
                time as an alternative.<br>
                The three parties of the centre - Folkpartiet, Centerpartiet and 
                Kristdemokraterna - have all stressed the need for a basic security 
                (grundtrygghet), but they have not accepted deviations from means-testing.<br>
                The conservatives, Moderaterna, favour a &quot;general and individual&quot; 
                system based on a clear correspondence between contributions and 
                benefits plus strict means-testing for those with special problems. 
                <br>
                Broad debate in Finland<br>
                In Finland both the public debate and the interest of the political 
                parties have been much broader than in Sweden. During the 1980s 
                and 1990s CW and BI proposals proliferated, and four parties, 
                representing some 40 per cent of the voters - the Centre party, 
                the Left Alliance, the Greens and the Young Finns - accepted the 
                idea in their political programmes. I shall mention a few examples 
                in order to illuminate the Finnish situation.<br>
                In 1988 Olli Rehn (from the Centre party) and David Pemberton 
                (from the Green party) took the initiative in creating a group 
                which would discuss and promote the idea of a basic income. The 
                group was chaired by Eva Kuuskoski-Vikatmaa, a leading personality 
                in the Centre Party and a long-time minister of Social and Health 
                Affairs. The group included representatives from most political 
                parties. Its secretary, Ilpo Lahtinen, wrote a book which reflected 
                the ideas discussed in the group. He proposed the introduction 
                of a partial basic income along lines suggested by Hermione Parker 
                in the UK. However, the book appeared at a most unfortunate time; 
                the Finnish economy was in the midst of a depressionary spiral, 
                and there was little interest for large reforms or costly improvements. 
                <br>
                The now minister of Social Affairs Osmo Soininvaara (representing 
                the Greens) has been an untiring champion of basic income. Since 
                the end of the 1970s he has elaborated the idea in several books 
                and reports. Hyvinvointivaltion eloonj&auml;&auml;misoppi (A survival 
                doctrine for the welfare state) was awarded a prize as the best 
                economics book of the year 1994. Here Soininvaara continued the 
                discussion on basic income in a concrete and detailed way. It 
                was based on two reports written by the author for the Ministry 
                of Social and Health Affairs. The base of his scheme was a basic 
                income (perustulo) differentiated for household composition. The 
                income tax rate would be 53%. The author proposed two types of 
                conditional &quot;extra allowances&quot; (lis&auml;tuki) to supplement 
                the basic income for special contingencies. His arguments had, 
                however, changed if compared to his original ideas. He was now 
                interested in creating a system that would induce everyone to 
                contribute as much as possible to the national economy, and explicitly 
                criticised those who wanted a CW in order to make work voluntary. 
                <br>
                In a recent academic study, Kansalaistulo sosiaalipoliittisena 
                muutoksena (Citizen's income as a change in social policy), Anita 
                Mattila compares nine different Finnish schemes. Her references 
                - which, with few exceptions, relates to the Finnish debate - 
                occupy no fewer than 18 pages.<br>
                The most explicit critics of a basic income in Finland have been 
                the employers' organisation (STK, later TT) and the national trade 
                union organisation (SAK). Both were critical towards the report 
                made by an official working group on social security in 1986. 
                STK interpreteted the suggested income guarantee as a citizen's 
                wage, since it was not conditional on willingness to work. The 
                organisation ridiculed the idea that there would be any mass unemployment 
                in the future and was afraid that it would become difficult to 
                get people willing to work. They asked for a more selective social 
                policy instead. According to SAK the report had to be remade from 
                a completely different premise. Social security should encourage 
                people to work and promote full employment.<br>
                In 1994 SAK published a report on basic income. The title Mik&auml; 
                ihmeen perustulo? is perhaps best translated as &quot;What on 
                earth is basic income?&quot;, which reflects the disapproval of 
                the idea. According to the report, full employment could be restored 
                through rapid and sustained economic growth, through reductions 
                in working time and work sharing, and through better education 
                and training. If a basic income scheme were introduced society 
                would develop towards a low-wage-low-skill society, a 'boot-cleaner 
                society'.<br>
                Differences between Sweden and Finland<br>
                There are two relatively obvious reasons why the interest for 
                basic income has differed between Finland and Sweden. The first 
                relates to the hegemony of the Swedish Social Democratic party 
                and the second to the relative success of the Swedish welfare 
                state.<br>
                The party most consistently opposed to any basic income proposal 
                both in Finland and in Sweden has been the Social Democrats. Both 
                SAP in Sweden and SDP in Finland have seen basic income as a break 
                with two fundamental principles: the &quot;work principle&quot; 
                and the &quot;income maintenance principle&quot;. The electoral 
                support of the Finnish SDP has been only about half of its Swedish 
                counterpart SAP. SDP has therefore always been compelled to form 
                coalition governments, whereas SAP has been able to govern alone 
                for most of the time since the 1930s. In Finland the Centre Party 
                has been as strong as the Social Democrats, and the Left Alliance 
                has competed on a more equal footing. Both the Centre Party and 
                the LA have traditionally tended to support universal benefits. 
                <br>
                The other obvious reason for the different receptions of the basic 
                income idea is that the Swedish welfare state is older and more 
                sacrosanct than the Finnish, and that Sweden - until recently 
                - has not been plagued by mass unemployment. Levels of benefits 
                are generally higher in Sweden. They are also more strongly related 
                to the income maintenance principle - the &quot;standard social 
                security&quot;. Income-related unemployment benefits - administered 
                by the trade unions - have covered about 85% of the earlier gross 
                incomes. In Finland the corresponding figure is 60%. The daily 
                allowance for the uninsured has also been more generous in Sweden. 
                It would, therefore, be relatively more costly to change the Swedish 
                system into a pure basic income system.<br>
                Sweden was able to avoid open mass unemployment until the beginning 
                of the 1990s. This was achieved by careful macroeconomic policies, 
                by active labour market policies and by a rapid growth of the 
                public service sector. In Finland mass unemployment appeared in 
                1976. It was gradually reduced towards the end of the 1980s, but 
                from 1991 onwards, mass unemployment has been the principal scourge 
                of the Finnish economy. Despite seven years of rapid economic 
                growth the rate of unemployment is still some 10%. Unemployment 
                in Sweden has not been eradicated, but it is only about half that 
                of Finland.<br>
                One reason why basic income has created more interest in Finland 
                may relate to a difference in national character. According to 
                experts on culture there is a clear difference. In Sweden it is 
                necessary to be part of and receive support from the collective. 
                No decisions are taken without long discussions and an emerging 
                consensus. In Finland leadership styles are more individualistic. 
                You are allowed to be somewhat idiosyncratic and to change your 
                opinions without engaging in long discussions. Finns are thrilled 
                by new technical solutions and they are not so afraid of sudden 
                changes. The Swedes seem to be more pragmatic and cautious.<br>
                Basic income is probably most welcomed in a society which is both 
                individualistic and solidaristic at the same time. There must 
                be a very special combination of values which allows citizens 
                to make unconventional choices at the same time as their basic 
                economic security is guaranteed by the state. </p>

              <p><b>Canada: Jean Chr&eacute;tien is considering the creation of 
                a cradle-to-grave guaranteed income programme.</b><br>
                The Prime Minister of Canada is reportedly preparing to assemble 
                a high-level committee to determine the feasibility of a lifetime 
                guaranteed annual income programme. One name being touted to lead 
                the committee is Ian Green, the deputy secretary to the Cabinet.<br>
                Top-level Liberals said yesterday they expect the initiative to 
                feature prominently in the upcoming Throne Speech, expected in 
                mid-February. Sources say little is known about whether significant 
                new funds would be drawn from the government's ballooning budget 
                surplus or when the program might be put in place. The minimum-income 
                supplement would be developed by merging all or parts of the federal 
                child benefit, welfare, employment insurance and old age pension 
                programs.<br>
                Officials at Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) have said 
                that the department plans to undertake a full review of all its 
                current income programmes and create an inventory of how much 
                gets spent in each of the regions. They admitt the federal government 
                is aware that any plan of this sort would be likely to raise concerns 
                in some provinces and that significant 'horse trading' of powers 
                will be required. Provinces usually view new social initiatives 
                with considerable suspicion, complaining that the government creates 
                new programs and then withdraws funding once the programmes are 
                up and running. In this case, the provinces would be likely to 
                demand a guarantee of perpetual funding.<br>
                Creating such a program would allow Mr. Chr&eacute;tien to fulfil 
                a number of his campaign promises, notably attacking child poverty 
                and restoring funding to social programs. More importantly for 
                Mr. Chr&eacute;tien, a guaranteed income programme would provide 
                him with a political legacy to rival Pierre Trudeau's repatriation 
                of the Constitution or Brian Mulroney's North American Free Trade 
                Agreement. People close to the Prime Minister said he was deeply 
                moved by the public outpouring of emotion at Mr. Trudeau's death 
                and the reverence for what he had built.<br>
                Mr. Chr&eacute;tien has suggested that his goal for the new Parliament 
                will be to wage war on poverty. &quot;The fact is that our prosperity 
                is not shared by all,&quot; the Prime Minister said in his keynote 
                address at the Liberal party's Confederation Dinner. &quot;There 
                remain, unfortunately, serious social problems in the land. Too 
                many children live in poverty. Too many aboriginal Canadians live 
                in Third World conditions. As a Liberal, I deeply believe that 
                government has the responsibility to promote social justice.&quot;<br>
                While Mr. Chr&eacute;tien's interest in it is new, the concept 
                of a national guaranteed income is not. It was originally espoused 
                by the economist Milton Friedman as early as 1962 and, at the 
                urging of the New Democrats, was examined by the Liberal government 
                of Lester B. Pearson, in whose Cabinet Mr. Chr&eacute;tien first 
                served. It again saw life in 1971 when it was openly championed 
                by Trudeau-era Cabinet heavyweight Marc Lalonde, who at the time 
                was Minister of Health and Welfare, in a report titled Federal 
                Income Security Protection. The idea was hotly debated, but was 
                never embraced by Mr. Trudeau and was eventually shelved.<br>
                The idea was resurrected during the 1993 election campaign when 
                the Reform Party added it to its platform as a way of streamlining 
                Canada's convoluted income-security programs. It was then considered 
                as part of the social security reform undertaken by the Chr&eacute;tien 
                government in its first term, but was ignored because it was seen 
                as potentially too expensive during a period of deficit-cutting.<br>
                As the deficit was pared down, the idea again caught the attention 
                of then-HRDC deputy minister Mel Cappe, who is now Clerk of the 
                Privy Council and Ottawa's most influential bureaucrat. Ian Green, 
                a former executive assistant to prime minister Joe Clark, was 
                an associate deputy minister under Mr. Cappe at Human Resources 
                Development Canada and is considered one of Mr. Cappe's most reliable 
                and trusted deputies. He moved over to the Privy Council Office 
                in 1998, a year before Mr. Cappe became the country's top public 
                servant.</p>
              <p><b>France: A decisive step towards a negative income tax ?</b><br>
                Along with a number of other countries across Europe, France is 
                considering a reduction of its income taxes. However, only about 
                one half of French households currently pay income tax, which 
                implies that only the comparatively rich half of the population 
                would benefit from the tax cut. For any European government, and 
                especially a red-green government, this makes such a measure hard 
                to sell. To make it acceptable, the government tried to couple 
                it with a reduction of the generalised social security contributions 
                (contribution sociale g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute;e: CSG) on 
                the lower layers of income, which would benefit the low-paid workers. 
                But France's supreme court (Conseil constitutionnel) turned down 
                this option on 19 December 2000, mainly on the ground that it 
                involved a discrimination among similarly situated households 
                and therefore violated the principle of equality before the tax 
                system. Some, including the social affairs minister Elizabeth 
                Guigou, then proposed to increase the minimum wage, while offsetting 
                the cost for the employers of low-paid workers through selective 
                cuts in their social security contributions. But a majority emerged 
                in favour of using a more straightforward method to boost the 
                disposable incomes of low-income households: to design the tax 
                cut in the form of a refundable tax credit. As the idea smells, 
                in the French context, of market-liberal ideology, a consensus 
                was not easy to reach. But by early January the Prime Minister 
                and Finance Minister became convinced that this was the way to 
                go, and on 11 January 2001 Le Monde's main headline was: &quot;Lionel 
                Jospin endorses the tax credit&quot;.<br>
                The following day's issue of the same newspaper carried, under 
                the title &quot;Tax credit: don't be shy, comrades!&quot;, a characteristically 
                crisp article by former Prime Minister Michel Rocard (also chairman 
                of the social affairs commission of the European Parliament and 
                one of the keynote speakers at BIEN's Berlin congress). He rejoiced 
                in the fact that the proportionality and hence the yield of the 
                CSG (introduced by the government he headed) was not affected, 
                and urged that the existing guaranteed minimum income scheme (Revenue 
                Minimum d'Insertion: RMI), which his government also introduced, 
                should evolve into a refundable tax credit of the negative-income-tax 
                type, such as the &quot;allocation compensatrice de revenu&quot; 
                recently proposed by the Rocard supporter Roger Godino. &quot;The 
                replacement of all that [the RMI and other assistance schemes 
                with a flavour of charity] by a single principle, applicable to 
                rich and poor alike, designed so as to provide people with work 
                incentives and to prevent them from being trapped in non-work 
                situations, is something that looks far more impressive and that 
                corresponds far more to a leftish conception of the relationship 
                between income, taxation and work.&quot; But what about the idea's 
                suspicious pedigree, in particular its association with Milton 
                Friedman, the founder of monetarism, &quot;which causes inequalities 
                to expand exponentially and many countries to be locked in underdevelopment&quot;? 
                Rocard suggests that we've got this system, whether we wish it 
                or not. &quot;Why then refuse the instrument for dampening human 
                suffering which Friedman himself had seen fit to append to the 
                system, as he understood the social cruelty of what he was proposing? 
                It would beat it all to take the worst and leave behind the best.&quot; 
                (Le Monde, 12.01.01)<br>
                From the information made available by the Finance Ministry, however, 
                it seems clear that the French version of the refundable tax credit 
                will not be integrated with either the RMI nor the tax reductions 
                for higher earners and will be similar to the American Earned 
                Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the British Working Families Tax Credit 
                (WFTC), rather than to a straight negative income tax, though 
                it would be more general from the start as it would not be restricted 
                to families with children. In the case of a single person, for 
                example, once the new scheme is fully in place (2003), the credit 
                would start at a level of about 2000 Euros annually for earnings 
                at 30% of the minimum wage, reach a maximum of nearly 7000 Euros 
                at the level of the minimum wage (about 850 Euros per month) and 
                be phased out gradually until it vanishes at 140% of the minimum 
                wage. Because of the refundable nature of the tax credit, this 
                is no doubt an important and unprecedented step in the direction 
                of a negative income tax and, beyond, of a universal basic income, 
                though more modest, for example, than the Netherlands' 2000 tax 
                reform.</p>
              <p><b>Ireland: The Conference of Religious of Ireland Justice Commission 
                welcomes interest in a Basic Income</b></p>
              <p>The Conference of Religious of Ireland's (CORI) Justice Commission 
                has welcomed the Final Report of the Irish Government's Working 
                Group on Basic Income. In particular it has welcomed the fact 
                that the Report vindicates the Commission's claim that a basic 
                income system would have a far more positive impact on reducing 
                poverty than the present tax and welfare systems.<br>
                The Economic and Social Research Insitute's (ESRI) study done 
                for the Working Group found that a basic income system would have 
                a substantial impact on the distribution of income in Ireland 
                in that, compared with the present tax and welfare system it would: 
                i) improve the incomes of 70% of households in the bottom four 
                deciles (i.e. the four tenths of the population with lowest incomes) 
                and ii) raise above this poverty line half of the individuals 
                who would be below the 40% poverty line under 'conventional' options.<br>
                According to the Report, these impacts would be achieved without 
                any resources additional to those available to 'conventional' 
                options.<br>
                The Working Group's Report also found that the tax rate (including 
                Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) replacement) required to fund 
                basic income, based on January 1999 estimates, would be 47%. Since 
                then the economy has grown significantly and the revised rate, 
                based on Revenue Commissioners' estimates of the tax base, is 
                42.7%.<br>
                This shows that a basic income system is far more effective at 
                tackling poverty and should form part of a comprehensive strategy 
                to eliminate income poverty totally in the years immediately ahead.<br>
                The Justice Commission says: &quot;Government should now honour 
                its commitment to publish a Green Paper on Basic Income. Implementation 
                of this commitment has been delayed pending receipt of this Working 
                Group's Report. Now that its results are available it should be 
                relatively easy for Government to publish its long-promised Green 
                Paper. The Report should also be considered by the National Economic 
                and Social Council (NESC) as it prepares its study on the medium-term 
                development of the tax and welfare systems. This study was promised 
                as part of the new national agreement, The Programme for Prosperity 
                and Fairness (PPF).&quot;<br>
                Looking at the 'losers' identified in the Report, there are two 
                key issues that need to be borne in mind, according to the commission: 
                Over a three-year implementation period of a basic income system 
                all the 'losers' would be better off than they are at present. 
                They would simply not gain as much under basic income as they 
                would under the present system; and the 'losers' in the bottom 
                four deciles identified in the Report could be easily targeted 
                and compensated through the Social Solidarity Fund which forms 
                part of the basic income structure.<br>
                On the macro-economic aspects the Report itself acknowledges that 
                the findings are very tentative, speculative and hard to quantify. 
                However, CORI welcomes the Report's conclusion that a basic income 
                system could encourage some people to move from the unofficial 
                economy into regular employment.<br>
                For the CORI Justice Commission the critical test of any tax and 
                welfare system is its impact on people with lower incomes. While 
                many poor people have benefited from developments of recent years, 
                especially through employment, the fact remains that the gap between 
                poor people and the rest of society has been widened over the 
                past twelve years. While the proportion of the population described 
                as &quot;consistently poor&quot; has been declining the percentage 
                of households and persons below every income poverty line measured 
                by the ESRI is higher now than it was in 1987. The commission 
                believes that this situation must be reversed immediately and 
                that the introduction of a Basic Income system would have an immediate 
                and positive impact on those most in need in Irish society. As 
                the commission says: &quot;The choice between a basic income system 
                and 'conventional' tax/welfare options is a trade off between 
                greater equity and a risk of lower economic growth versus less 
                equity and less risk to higher economic growth. At a time when 
                so much concern is expressed about the country's growth rate being 
                unsustainable, the argument in favour of introducing a Basic Income 
                system is further strengthened.&quot;<br>
                CORI is a Social Partner and was one of the organisations that 
                negotiated and signed the last two national agreements, i.e. Partnership 
                2000 and the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It represents 
                more than 135 religious congregations with 12,000 members in 1,400

              <p><b>The USA: The Radical Middle Newsletter reports on a Basic 
                Income option</b><br>
                Under the headline, 'Maybe the election will shame us into sharing 
                our wealth,' the September / October 2000 issue of the Radical 
                Middle Newsletter (edited by Mark Satin) reported on six new proposals 
                for the redistribution of income and wealth, including the basic 
                income guarantee. Here are excerpts: <br>
                &quot;For the first time in four decades, Americans have been 
                talking about how to intelligently share their wealth. . . . At 
                least six such ideas are ready to fly . . . if their champions 
                can get them off the ground. . . . <br>
                &quot;The guaranteed income was a hot new idea in the 1960s, assiduously 
                promoted by Robert Theobald and other young turks. But it never 
                went anywhere. Today's basic income proponents are more market-friendly 
                than most of their Sixties counterparts. And they're using arguments 
                that are more pragmatic (even their term-of-choice, 'basic income,' 
                is less incendiary than the term 'guaranteed income'). <br>
                &quot;For the last three years, Research Associate Karl Widerquist 
                has been doing yeoman work on the basic income at the Jerome Levy 
                Economics Institute in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. In his policy 
                papers (no. 245 and no. 289 at www.levy.org), Widerquist provides 
                reams of evidence that &quot;interest in [the basic income] is 
                again gaining&quot; -- in part because it's seen as a poverty-precluding 
                mechanism. The new advocates are calling for smallish basic incomes 
                that would deter (or at least ease) poverty, not middle-class-like 
                guaranteed incomes. One typical proposal calls for a basic annual 
                income of $8,000 for each adult and $2,000 for each child. Another 
                calls for $4,000 per person. <br>
                &quot;Perhaps the best-known member of the new generation of basic 
                income advocates is Philippe Van Parijs. Educated at Oxford and 
                Berkeley, he started working on the topic on a commune in 1977 
                . . . and is still working on it as a professor-activist at Louvain 
                University in Belgium. <br>
                &quot;Like Widerquist, Van Parijs is long past imagining that 
                a basic income would turn us all into wonderful people. He's interested 
                in freedom, efficiency, and ecology, not in the New Person. 'The 
                freedom we need to be concerned with is not just the freedom to 
                choose among [products],' he says in his scholarly clarion call, 
                Real Freedom for All (1995). 'It is the freedom to choose among 
                the various lives one might wish to lead.' <br>
                &quot;A good capitalist, Van Parijs thinks the basic income can 
                make the high-job-turnover, information age economy more efficient: 
                'With a basic income, individuals could go through repeated and 
                protracted periods [during which they learned] new skills. [And] 
                there would be less [need for government programs like] minimum 
                wage legislation.' Van Parijs also sees the basic income as fundamental 
                for ecologists. To the extent the basic income 'encourages simple 
                living,' he says, it would slow down the 'spread of significant 
                environmental externalities.' <br>
                &quot;In the U.S., the Green Party supports the basic income. 
                Its platform calls for 'a graduated supplemental income, or a 
                negative income tax, that would maintain all individual adult 
                incomes above the poverty level, regardless of employment or marital 
                status' (www.gp.org).&quot; <br>
                Other proposals discussed in the article include: (1) 'Universal 
                capitalism' as Kenneth Taylor calls ideas based on Louis Kelso's 
                original proposal for universal stock ownership. (2) The 'living 
                wage' movement. (3) The National Jobs for All Coalition. (4) Employer 
                subsidies for hiring low wage labour as proposed by Edmund Phelps 
                and Robert Haveman. And (5) 'Self-help accounts' or 'stakeholder 
                accounts,' as proposed by Bruce Akerman and others. This idea 
                is similar to the basic income guarantee because it includes a 
                universal grant, but the grant is given at key points in a person's 
                life rather than regularly throughout a person's life. <br>
                Satin criticizes the Basic Income Guarantee for being just a little 
                too radical for the Radical Middle. &quot;On the one hand, [basic 
                income and universal capitalism] would give each of us maximum 
                freedom. On the other hand, they'd strip us of responsibility 
                for standing on our own two feet.&quot; He mentions the often 
                quoted, but questionable, criticisms of the negative income tax 
                experiments in the United States in the late 1970s: that it broke 
                up marriages and caused people to quit their jobs. But he concluded 
                that any of the six proposals would be vastly better than the 
                meagre proposals put forth by Gore and Bush during the election 
                campaign. <br>

                The USA: A temporary Basic Income proposal is made in the New 
                York Times<br>
                Richard Freeman, an economist at Harvard, and Eileen Appelbaum 
                of the Economic Policy Institute propose sending a one-off 'prosperity 
                dividend' of $500 to every citizen of the United States. They 
                made the proposal in a piece in the New York Times on the 1st 
                February 2001 entitled 'Instead of a Tax Cut, Send Out Dividends.'<br>
                Freeman and Appelbaum's logic is two-fold: First, the United States 
                now has an enormous budget surplus and therefore it can afford 
                to give back the roughly $140 billion that the prosperity dividend 
                would cost. Second, as worries of a recession increase President 
                Bush has promoted his tax cut plan as a way to stimulate the economy. 
                Tax cuts, however, are a rather slow method to stimulate the economy. 
                If enacted, they probably wouldn't have much of an effect until 
                next year, by which time the economy may already be recovering. 
                The prosperity dividend could be enacted immediately; it would 
                have a strong stimulative effect on the economy; it would mean 
                most to those who have least; and it would not have long-lasting 
                effects on the tax code. Despite this idea's merits, it has little 
                chance of being adopted by the Bush administration. George W. 
                Bush's primary motive for his tax cut proposal does not seem to 
                be fiscal stimulus, but a strong desire to reduce the tax burden 
                on wealthy Americans. <br>
                Of course, a one-time dividend is far from a full basic income 
                guarantee, but the authors cite the Alaska Permanent Fund as an 
                inspiration, and the prosperity dividend is similar enough that 
                it could open up people's minds to this sort of idea. </p>
              <p><b>The USA: President Bush considers a refundable child tax credit</b><br>
                The Caregivers' tax credit campaign has reported that making the 
                child tax credit refundable is now on the national agenda. The 
                proposal is for a refundable tax credit of $1000 per child. The 
                current child tax credit mostly benefits families with children 
                above $25,000 - those with low or no wages get little to nothing 
                at all. Refundability would extend the benefit to all children 
                in families with incomes below that level. This is not a complete 
                solution to income for poor people nor is it a basic income guarantee, 
                but $1000 makes an enormous difference if you're poor. The caregivers' 
                tax credit campaign urges you to contact your members of Congress 
                and urge them to support this legislation. For more information 
                see:<br>
                http://www.caregivercredit.org. <br>
                For those who are skeptical about the difference between a caregivers' 
                tax credit and a true basic income guarantee, it has one very 
                important thing in common with it: it lacks the poverty trap aspects 
                that made Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) so unpopular. 
                Also, the guaranteed income movement of the 1960s and 70s is often 
                spoken of as if it were a complete failure, but it led directly 
                to the creation of two successful government programs: Food Stamps 
                and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Most likely, the success 
                of the EITC has played a big part in making it possible for a 
                refundable child tax credit to enter the political agenda. Thus, 
                the guaranteed income movement of the 1960s is still indirectly 
                having a positive effect on legislation today. A small refundable 
                child credit now could lead to a larger one in the future and 
                perhaps someday to a refundable adult credit. But this is by no 
                means an inevitable course of events, as the British experience 
                of child benefit shows.</p>

                This book has been inspired by concern for the future of social 
                inclusion and citizenship rights in the context of the profound 
                social, political and economic changes and challenges modern societies 
                are faced with in the 21st century. In Europe, two developments 
                in particular need to be considered, namely the crisis of the 
                'European Social Model' and national-level social citizenship 
                on the one hand, and integration problems in the development of 
                the European Union and transnational social citizenship on the 
                other.<br>
                This book aims to explore the potential of a variety of innovative 
                and inclusive policy strategies concerned with work and employment, 
                and relating to the roles of civil society and citizens in those 
                strategies. Thus it includes studies of policies concerned with 
                civil society's role in work and welfare policy, innovative approaches 
                to work and employment, urban level work and income policies, 
                and the basic income approach to income distribution.<br>
                The book is concerned with the current development of the European 
                Union and with the prospects for EU-level social policy and citizenship 
                policy, and it makes a contribution to debates on the medium-term 
                development of EU-level policies concerned with deepening the 
                integration of the EU by developing the general status and rights

                This book discusses aspects of work in terms of social inclusion 
                and exclusion. It explores unemployment and non-standard employment 
                and evaluates social and labour-market policies and their effects 
                in four European countries: Denmark, the UK, the Netherlands and 
                Portugal. These represent the typical welfare regimes in Europe: 
                a Scandinavian, social-democratic model; a liberal, Anglo-Saxon 
                model; a corporate, 'Bismarckian' model; and a southern 'variant'. 
                The analyses provide a thorough insight into the variety of issues 
                in recent labour-market developments in the four countries and 
                combine this with an overview of the major schemes and programmes 
                designed to combat social exclusion. The book is an important 
                contribution to the debate on the development of a specific European 
                strategy on work, unemployment and social inclusion based upon 
                alternatives to new-liberal strategies.</p>

                In the same vein but more modestly than Ackerman and Alstott's 
                Stakeholder Society (Yale U.P. 1999), this is a lucid and firm 
                plea for a universal yet conditional grant of about 15.000 Euros 
                to be paid to all young people at the age of 18, to be funded 
                by an inheritance tax and to be used for education purposes, as 
                a down-payment on a house or as start-up capital for a business 
                venture. Quite a distance from an unconditional basic income! 
                But some arguments will sound familiar to basic income supporters,

                &quot;Everyone born into a developed country benefits from a share

                In this paper on marginality and inequalities in Western cities, 
                the renowned Berkeley-based French sociologist Lo&iuml;c Wacquant 
                briefly reasserts his commitment to an unconditional basic income: 
                &quot;Radical innovations, such as the institution of a citizen's 
                wage (or unconditional income grant) that would sever subsistence 
                from work, expand access to education through the life-course, 
                and effectively guarantee universal access to essential public 
                goods such as housing, health, and transportation, are needed 
                to expand social rights and check the deleterious effects of the 
                mutation of wage-labour&quot; (p.118).</p>

              <p><b>Social Policy, Marginalisation, and Citizenship: a conference 
                to be held at Aalborg University, Denmark, from 2 - 4 November 
                2001</b><br>
                The purpose of the conference is to contribute to a clarification 
                of the dynamics and effects of changes in society, policies, and 
                the aims and purposes of social policy. On the subject of a session 
                on the afternoon of 3 November the organisers write: &quot;The 
                erosion of the Fordist system of production has resulted at the 
                same time in the de?institutionalisation of the traditional threefold 
                organisation of the life-course. A new, flexible organisation 
                of the life course is emerging. This new flexibility results in 
                uncertain, de?standardised and mixed trajectories, as education, 
                work and inactivity alternate in complex, variable ways that are 
                hard to define and to manage. The 'old' welfare state models and 
                their assumptions with respect to the relation between work, welfare 
                and age are increasingly out of joint and out of time with the 
                new needs for security that more flexible life?course trajectories 
                have bred.. These changes in the life cycle and the increasing 
                need for new models of social security and social policy will 
                be the focus of this session.&quot; See http://www1.ldc.lu.se/soch/conference.htm
