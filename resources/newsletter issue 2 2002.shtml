                The trustees would like to thank those of our readers who have 
                responded so generously to the appeal for financial assistance 
                contained in our last newsletter. The trust is now able to continue 
                its work and to plan for the future.</p>
              <p>Many organizations now operate entirely on the internet, without 
                printed publications. The Citizen's Income Trust is considering 
                using the internet as the chief means of disseminating its regular 
                newsletter. (Printed copies of the internet version would be made 
                available to anyone who does not have access to the internet). 
                If you would like to comment on this suggested change, please 
                write to the Trust's Director.</p>

              <p><font size="4">The definition of a Citizen's Income</font><br>
              </p>
              <p>Inside the front cover of Bulletin no.7 (Spring 1988) we find 
                the following definition: &quot;A Basic Income Scheme would phase 
                out as many reliefs and allowances against personal income tax, 
                and as many existing state-financed cash benefits as practicable; 
                and would replace them with a basic income paid automatically 
                to each and every man, woman and child. Basic Income would enhance 
                individual freedom, and would help to: <br>
                &middot; prevent poverty<br>
                &middot; end the poverty and unemployment traps<br>
                &middot; reduce unemployment<br>
                &middot; create a less divided society.'<br>
                In an article by Bill Jordan in the same issue we find this: &quot;A 
                Basic Income Scheme would aim to guarantee to each man, woman 
                and child the unconditional right to an independent income sufficient 
                to meet basic living costs. Its main purpose would be the prevention 
                of poverty, as opposed to mere poverty relief&quot; (p.3). He 
                further defines a Basic Income in terms of adequacy, simplicity, 
                equity and economic efficiency. The trust deed of the Basic Income 
                Research Group (which later became the Citizen's Income Trust) 
                similarly defines Basic Income Schemes &quot;as schemes which 
                guarantee to each and every man woman and child the unconditional 
                right to an independent income.&quot; <br>
                There is clearly a conflict here, for either a Basic Income provides 
                enough to live on or it doesn't; and there is an ambiguity, for 
                to 'guarantee' to someone a particular income might mean that 
                we aim to top up what they've already got to a particular level: 
                that is, on this definition, the Basic Income could be a means-tested 
                benefit. In the first definition there is no such ambiguity: the 
                income is paid 'automatically' to each and every man, woman and 
                child. In Bulletin no.8 (Autumn 1988) Tony Walter summarises the 
                discussions which had led to the abandonment of the 'guarantee' 
                terminology (terminology which had been employed since Sir Brandon 
                Rhys Williams MP gave evidence in support of a 'Basic Income Guarantee' 
                to the Treasury and Civil Service Committee Sub-committee on the 
                structure of personal income taxation and income support on Wednesday 
                21st July 1982). The main reason for dropping the 'guarantee' 
                language was to ensure that a Basic Income would be understood 
                as an equal payment made to every citizen, and to make sure that 
                it could not be interpreted as a means-tested or needs-based payment. 
                Walter is equally clear that the Basic Income being discussed 
                would not meet everyone's basic living costs.<br>
                Also in issue no.8 Hermione Parker describes a 'Basic Income Guarantee' 
                scheme which is in fact a negative income tax with everyone in 
                the scheme: i.e., low earners and those not earning would receive 
                a payment, and higher earners would pay tax. This could, of course, 
                have the same effect as an equal cash payment to every individual, 
                except that in a Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax scheme the employer 
                is involved in the administration of income tax and administrative 
                complications would be bound to arise when someone left or entered 
                employment.<br>
                So already we have encountered a variety of possible alternative 
                definitions for a Basic Income or Citizen's Income:<br>
                &middot; An equal payment to every citizen or the guarantee of 
                a minimum income<br>
                &middot; A payment sufficient to live on (somehow defined) or 
                a payment not sufficient to live on<br>
                &middot; A cash payment to every citizen or a negative income 
                tax scheme to which everyone belongs.<br>
                At the Basic Income European Network's third conference in 1990 
                terminological confusion had made debate difficult, so in Bulletin 
                no.12 (February 1991) Parker distinguished between 'work status 
                benefits' and 'citizenship incomes', amongst which she listed 
                Basic Income (BI), Social Dividend (SD) and Negative Income Tax 
                (NIT). An American definition of NIT is used, which makes the 
                family the assessment unit and the rules different for beneficiaries 
                and taxpayers, thus clearly distinguishing NIT from BI. (A SD 
                is defined in the same way as a BI except that it is funded by 
                a windfall tax rather than by income tax).<br>
                Already 'Citizen's Income' was replacing 'Basic Income' in some 
                circles as the normal term for an unconditional payment (because 
                'Citizen's Income' more clearly expresses what is intended); and 
                then, in 1992, Tony Atkinson proposed a 'Participation Income': 
                a sort of Citizen's Income payable to everyone participating in 
                society by employment or by voluntary caring work. (See Bulletin 
                no.16, July 1993). The Citizen's Income Trust's rough calculations 
                showed that only about 1% of the population would not receive 
                the Participation Income, but the consensus turned against calling 
                it a Citizen's Income because of the conditionality associated 
                with it and the administrative difficulties which it would inevitably 
                encounter (though in Bulletin no.17 (January 1994) Parker reproduced 
                her 1991 chart with a Participation Income classified as a 'Citizen's 
                Income' alongside NIT, SD and BI, and not as a work-based benefit).<br>
                Since then there has been no systematic discussion of definitions, 
                but the revival of the ambiguous 'Basic Income Guarantee' terminology 
                in the USA now makes such discussion essential; and such discussion 
                really ought to begin with an exploration of the nature of definition, 
                rather than with the thing defined, exploration which will now 
                be aided by the work of Eleanor Rosch on the nature of definitions, 
                categories and concepts. Rosch realised that to understand categories 
                as absolute concepts does not match the real world (see her 'Reclaiming 
                Concepts' in Walter J. Freeman and Rafael N&uacute;&ntilde;ez 
                (eds.) Reclaiming Cognition (Journal of Consciousness Studies, 
                vol.6, nos.11-12, 1999), pp.61-77). The category 'bird' contains 
                robins, but it also contains ostriches which can't fly and it 
                doesn't contain bats which can. So instead of listing characteristics 
                which an entity has to possess in order to belong to a category, 
                Rosch suggests that we build theory on practice and that we should 
                choose prototypical members of categories and then decide how 
                similar other entities are to these prototypes. In this way, categories 
                can be structured rather than monochrome (that is, some creatures 
                can be more bird-like than others: which they are) and category 
                boundaries can be fuzzy (which they usually are).<br>
                My proposal is that we should regard an all-age Child Benefit 
                (paid to the individual for adults) as the prototypical Citizen's 
                Income. This means that the prototypical Citizen's Income is a 
                universal, unconditional and automatic cash payment to every citizen. 
                The definition is silent on the amount to be paid, thus leaving 
                that issue entirely open; it makes it impossible to confuse a 
                Negative Income Tax with a Citizen's Income; and it puts a Participation 
                Income on the boundary of the category, as it does the family-based 
                Citizen's Income proposed by Samuel Brittan and Steven Webb in 
                their Beyond the Welfare State (Aberdeen University Press, 1990).<br>
                Debate on a Citizen's Income is going to remain an important contribution 
                to the debate on reform of tax and benefits, at least until a 
                Citizen's Income is established. One of the Citizen's Income Trust's 
                contributions to that debate must surely be to ensure that discussion 
                on reform options is carried out on the basis of definitions which 
                are clear, comprehensible, and unambiguous.</p>
              <p><font size="5">Events</font></p>
              <p><font size="4">United States Basic Income Guarantee conference, 
                8th to 9th March 2002</font><br>
                About 75 people attended the two day event at one time or another. 
                Mostly they were economists, political activists, sociologists, 
                historians, law professors, social workers, film <br>
                makers, graduate and undergraduate students and writers. Many 
                of those present were in the thick of the fight for a guaranteed 
                income in the late 60s and early 70s.<br>
                Guy Standing and Eduardo Suplicy were keynote speakers. About 
                36 papers were presented in 12 different sessions which drew about 
                15-20 people each. Several people spoke on the history of BIG 
                in the US and the results of the Negative Income Tax experiments 
                of the 70s. Other topics included &quot;Funding a Basic Income,&quot; 
                &quot;Is Basic Income a Right?&quot; &quot;A Swedish-style Welfare 
                State or a Basic Income; which is best?&quot; Among the participants 
                were Karl Widerquist, Stan Aronowitz, Fred Block, Robert Harris, 
                Charles Clark, Anne Alstott, Harold Watts, Sally Lerner. <br>
                We discussed how to build on the event, and it is possible that 
                papers will be published.<br>
                We plan to have a second USBIG Congress within two years and are 
                currently looking for space and funding. USBIG has no formal structure, 
                no formal membership, and no budget except for what we can raise 
                for special events.<br>

              <p>Malcolm, <br>
                I'm writing to answer your question from your newsletter. After 
                your notice of the USBIG conference, you asked if we could clear 
                up an ambiguity about the definition of BIG. BIG is a generic 
                term for both nonmeans-tested and means-tested plans to ensure 
                that everyone's income reaches a certain level. USBIG is designed 
                to be a forum for supporters of both.<br>
                Karl</p>
              <p>Karl,<br>
                Thanks. That's helpful.<br>
                The confusion arises because when 'Basic Income Guarantee' was 
                first employed by Brandon Rhys Williams in the UK in a submission 
                to a Parliamentary select committee the term meant (unambiguously) 
                a universal and nonmeanstested cash benefit. Our government, in 
                relation to pensions, now uses 'Minimum income guarantee' to mean 
                a means-tested payment to ensure that elderly people's income 
                reaches a certain level. 'x income guarantee' is therefore a confusing 
                group of terms, and some of us think it might be better to avoid 
                the terminology and talk only of a 'citizen's income', i.e, a 
                universal and nonwithdrawal cash payment, and 'means-tested benefits' 
                meaning meanstested benefits. I hope the conference goes well.<br>
                Malcolm</p>
              <p>Malcolm,<br>
                Thanks for the information. I knew that the term had been used 
                in Britain some time ago, it came to the US via Sean Healey and 
                Charley Clark. We felt free to redefine it a bit because it had 
                been a little used term. We needed a term for both the so-called 
                means-tested and non-means-tests plans because our membership 
                includes supporters of both. BIG then was ideal because it recalls 
                both basic income and the guaranteed income as the negative income 
                tax was known in the US, and of course, it makes a good acronym.<br>
                I'm very excited about our first conference. I'll keep you posted 
                on how it goes.<br>

              <p><font size="4">Social Security Policy Under New Labour: a conference 
                held at the Institute for Fiscal Studies on Wednesday 22nd May</font><br>
              </p>
              <p>After five years of Labour government the Institute for Fiscal 
                Studies believed that it was time for a review of emerging trends, 
                so organised a day conference on the 22nd May. About eighty people 
                came, and the quality of the presentations and of the debate was 
                high. <br>
                After Andrew Dilnot's opening remarks, Ed Miliband, of HM Treasury, 
                listed the actions taken in the social security and taxation field 
                by the government during the past five years: the New Deal, the 
                Working Families Tax Credit (soon to be the Working Tax Credit), 
                a Minimum Income Guarantee for pensioners, and a one-off increase 
                in Child Benefit. Still to come are the Child Tax Credit and Pension 
                Credit. One of the aims of this process is integration of tax 
                and benefits, as the division is thought to be outdated and stigmatising, 
                and for benefit to be received in the form of Tax Credits should 
                mean less stigma, partly because more people will receive them 
                than received Family Credit. Another aim is what Miliband called 
                'progressive universalism', by which he means means-tested rather 
                than contributory benefits. He believes tax credits to be a break 
                with the means-testing of the past, especially as the rules allow 
                income to rise throughout the year without a change in the credit 
                having to be made before the year end. <br>
                Of the other papers, Mark Brewer's discussed the different work 
                incentives experienced by different groups; John Hills offered 
                a summary of public opinion in relation to the incentives, the 
                depth of poverty, and the levels of expenditure on particular 
                benefits, and he described New Labour's approach as 'selective 
                universalism and a patchwork assault on poverty'; James Sefton 
                discussed optimal social security design, particularly in relation 
                to pensions; Fran Bennett looked at gender implications of current 
                reforms; Donald Hirsch explored the links between welfare reform 
                and working hours; and Matthew Wakefield quantified the effects 
                of recent reforms: 90% of families with children will be eligible 
                for the Child Tax Credit, and 50% of pensioners for the pension 
                credit; the new system is increasing incomes in the poorest deciles 
                and decreasing them slightly in the wealthiest; and the main losers 
                appear to be single- and two-earner couples without children. 
                The verdict: the 'softer' means test represented by tax credits 
                will reduce the administrative difficulties faced by claimants, 
                and will thus reduce the stigma attached to means-tested benefits; 
                but that, although marginal tax rates will certainly be reduced 
                for some, many more people than before will find themselves subject 
                to a means test. <br>
                Of particular interest to readers of this newsletter will be Lord 
                Plant's presentation on citizenship, in which he distinguished 
                between citizenship as status (granting rights to social security) 
                and citizenship as achievement (where contributions earn benefits). 
                No system conforms to either of these two ideal positions, and 
                Lord Plant discussed the concept of a 'Participation Income' as 
                the addition of an element of obligation to rights related to 
                citizenship as status. In his view, New Labour's approach is partly 
                at the 'citizenship as achievement' end (as there is an obligation 
                to contribute through employment and taxation) and partly at the 
                'citizenship as status' end (as means-tested benefits fit this 
                definition of citizenship); but with the emphasis on work as the 
                badge of citizenship, a recession will require the government 
                to re-legitimise long-term benefits or to become the employer 
                of last resort. The presentation contained an endorsement of the 
                Citizen's Income approach to tax and benefit reform, for such 
                an approach would provide an important element of citizenship 
                as status to balance the present preoccupation with citizenship 
                as achievement. <br>
                Our verdict: the government's aims are in the right area. It is 
                important to reduce stigma, to increase incentives, to integrate 
                tax and benefits, and to decrease poverty. Those policy initiatives 
                which serve these ends are to be warmly welcomed. But sometimes 
                the terms mask the reality. Tax credits are not an integration 
                of tax and benefits, for the credit is calculated via a complex 
                household needs- and means-test, whereas income tax is calculated 
                on an individual basis and not in relation to need. Similarly, 
                the government calls its approach 'progressive universalism', 
                by which they mean means-tested benefits such as the Minimum Income 
                Guarantee for pensioners. Child Benefit is a universal benefit, 
                and it is progressive because it provides a higher proportion 
                of the income of the poor than it does of the income of the rich. 
                To use the same terminology for means-tested benefits does the 
                debate about social security reform no favours. <br>
                The IFS are to be commended for holding such an excellent conference. 
                We hope that the papers given at the conference will be published 
                soon, and preferably together, to help all of us to arrive at 
                informed and considered verdicts on social security policy under 
                New Labour.</p>

                OUTLINE OF CONGRESS THEMES<br>
                Income security as a right<br>
                This session will explore ways by which greater income security 
                can be promoted in both developed and developing countries. Should 
                a universal income floor be included among economic rights? Is 
                that feasible and desirable? Should income security be provided 
                through targeting or through constitutional or other guarantees? 
                <br>
                Assessing selectivity<br>
                Across the world, social protection policy has shifted away from 
                universalism towards more complex forms of selectivity and targeting, 
                with increased reliance on means-testing, behaviour-testing and 
                other forms of conditionality. Questions addressed will be: do 
                these policies lead to efficacy and equity? do they penalise some 
                vulnerable groups, such as women? what, if any, forms of selectivity 
                in social transfers are desirable? The session will consider arguments 
                for reviving old and new forms of universalism. <br>
                Citizenship credit cards<br>
                As countries move towards integrated tax-benefit systems, and 
                as information technology advances, we are moving into an era 
                in which electronic means of transfer are likely to become the 
                norm. This session will present papers on this prospect. Are transfer 
                cards feasible? Are they desirable? What forms of 'card' offer 
                the best prospect of facilitating income security? Different examples 
                of citizenship credit cards will be demonstrated throughout the 
                Congress.<br>
                Legitimising basic income politically<br>
                This session will confront one of the great challenges of the 
                era, the apparent growth of much more stratified societies in 
                which notions of social solidarity are under tremendous strain. 
                Papers will address the fundamental question: Can basic income 
                be legitimised and made appealing to enough people and social 
                groups in highly stratified societies? <br>
                Pre-Congress session: Income security in Switzerland<br>
                The host country for the Congress has achieved sustained economic 
                growth and moderate levels of unemployment. However, significant 
                poverty and economic insecurity exist. The session will consider 
                how well existing transfer schemes reach the poor, including the 
                RMR developed in the canton of Geneva. It will also review the 
                political debates around selectivity and universalism. <br>

              <p><font size="4">'Basic income' could prove an escape route from 
                the benefits trap <br>
                by Professor Patrick Minford</font><br>
              </p>
              <p>The modern welfare state is a huge system of transfers from the 
                better-off and the average to the needy - and now also to the 
                not-so-needy whose incomes come right up to the average. Yes, 
                tax credits now are received by family people with incomes as 
                high as &pound;20,000 a year.<br>
                For these people, the marginal rate of tax is about 70pc, because 
                on top of ordinary taxes comes the means-tested claw-back of the 
                tax credit at 37 pence for every extra pound earned. Such high 
                marginal tax rates are now a serious drag on incentives to acquire 
                new skills, essential for keeping people in work in the face of 
                cut-throat competition from unskilled workers in poor countries.<br>
                The [Citizen's Income Trust] thinks this is stupid: the right 
                way to help people is to give them a &quot;basic income&quot; 
                independently of what they otherwise earn. The key advantage is 
                that it does not raise recipients' marginal tax rates to these 
                ludicrously high levels. The obvious disadvantage is that since 
                the benefit is not means-tested it costs the taxpayer a great 
                deal more. British governments have wrestled with this dilemma 
                for as long as any of us can remember.<br>
                Before Gordon Brown, the Conservatives had decided, following 
                the review in the 1980s by Norman Fowler, to concentrate benefits 
                mainly on people with children and to means-test them strongly 
                so that marginal tax rates were exceedingly high (close to 90pc) 
                but only for people on rather low incomes: thus creating the &quot;poverty 
                trap&quot;. Benefits for those in work were designed to give work 
                incomes just a bit higher than unemployment benefits; hence there 
                was also an &quot;unemployment trap&quot; in the sense that it 
                was not really worth while to take a low-paid job.<br>
                On the other hand the tests for staying on unemployment benefits 
                became steadily tougher, culminating in the Job Seeker's Allowance 
                in the 1990s. This was intended to &quot;force&quot; people back 
                to work, by simply denying benefits after a set period of time. 
                The incentive to get work then becomes absolute, since there is 
                no alternative.<br>
                The virtue of the Conservative system was that it got people back 
                to work without having to bribe them; it then penalised skill-acquisition 
                by very low-paid workers but these were relatively few in number 
                (around half a million). Nevertheless, these workers, few or not, 
                were the most vulnerable to repeated spells of unemployment as 
                their low-wage jobs would be constantly eroded by competition. 
                The problem was that this system left them with no incentive to 
                change.<br>
                Gordon Brown came in determined both to relieve poverty and to 
                &quot;make work worthwhile&quot;. He retained the Conservatives' 
                tough approach to unemployment, renaming it &quot;no fifth option&quot;. 
                He also raised working people's benefits (as &quot;tax credits&quot;) 
                by up to 10 per cent, holding unemployment benefits constant.<br>
                This alone guaranteed that he would bring many more people into 
                benefit and therefore the poverty trap, even retaining the Conservatives' 
                means-testing formula. But he went further and softened the means 
                test, with the result we have seen above, that people right up 
                to average incomes are now caught in a poverty trap. In fact the 
                Budget Report admits that one and a half million will face &quot;marginal 
                rates over 60 per cent&quot; (for which read 70 per cent or so). 
                The cost of Brown's tax credits is also a billion pounds or so 
                higher than the Conservative system.<br>
                What might a Basic Income (BI) look like today? A good starting 
                point is the unemployment support rates, calibrated to support 
                a family just above the poverty level. Now give families in work 
                whose earners are on the minimum wage enough to reach these amounts 
                - since family costs depend on the numbers of children, the BI 
                could be given per child, just as child benefit is. No need to 
                give them more since with &quot;no fifth option&quot; there is 
                absolutely no need to bribe people back to work. The cost of enhanced 
                child benefits would still be more than Gordon Brown's existing 
                (&pound;4 billion) system of tax credits - perhaps as much as 
                2 pence on the standard rate. Against this the family in work 
                with BI would then face normal marginal tax rates - 30pc or so.<br>
                In a fully-employed economy with no fifth option the effect of 
                such a small rise in tax rate on the average taxpayer's working 
                behaviour is probably negligible; but the dramatic improvement 
                in incentives, especially to train, at the bottom of the pay-scale 
                could have a substantial effect on skills, productivity and urban 
                prosperity. Tempting? Yes, but perhaps not practical when taxes 
                are already rising, to be poured fruitlessly into the NHS black 
                hole.<br>
                Nevertheless, over time as real wages rise relative to unemployment 
                benefits and employment spreads within the household, the cost 
                will fall. Meanwhile, one could go part of the way by switching 
                some of the Brown credits into child benefit. The dependency culture 
                afflicting our inner cities is caused by high marginal tax rates 
                on honest effort and retraining, interacting with the untaxed 
                gains from crime. Eliminating those high tax rates on our poorest 
                citizens by moving further to a toughly-calibrated Basic Income 
                would not cure dependency; but it would remove one of its key 
                ingredients.<br>

                that 'in spite of the Treasury and the DfEE's rhetoric on the 
                quality of labour markets, real opportunities to move out of unemployment/the

                rented accommodation, and a Housing Benefit system 'that makes 
                both taking a job and living in decent accommodation possible,

                they should be taking responsibility for their own financial provision 
                in retirement and that the state wouldn't provide. This view was 
                also shared by some of the pre-retired, but not by the older, 
                retired generation. There was clearly a generation factor in play: 
                many of those aged in their 60s and 70s had spent their working 
                lives believing that the state would provide for them 'from cradle 
                to grave', including in retirement. This left many feeling angry 
                that the state pension had not been as generous as they had been 
                led to believe. They also felt that people who hadn't worked were 
                better provided for by the state in terms of state benefits. People 
                made comparisons and felt that those who had worked and provided 
                for themselves, as they had, were penalised: 'I didn't plan anything 
                &#133;. You thought that if you paid your stamp, then that was 
                your pension' (retired); 'Seems to me if you've got your own private 
                pension then you're penalised' (pre-retired).&quot;</p>
              <p>The Centre for Research in Social Policy, in its annual report 
                2000/2001, reports on its 'Traps and Springboards in European 
                Minimum Income Systems' project: &quot;In Greece, the lack of 
                a universal safety net may lead to over-reliance on the family 
                as a provider of welfare. However, even in countries with well-established 
                minimum income schemes - Belgium, Denmark and the UK - there can 
                be no grounds for complacency as the extent of movement down into 
                inadequate protection and poverty is high. Large proportions of 
                people who fell through the safety nets into 'insufficient protection' 
                departed from work. This suggests that the capacity of the minimum 
                income systems in each of these countries to prevent poverty is 
                unreliable for many groups of people, particularly those who are 
                separated and divorced, in bad health and of lower occupational 
                status. The tightening of eligibility rules for unemployment benefits 
                since the observed period, 1993-1995, may mean that the circumstances 
                of these people have further deteriorated.&quot;</p>
              <p>The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, in its findings for April 2002, 
                has summarised a report by Elena Bardasi and Stephen P. Jenkins, 
                titled Income in later life: Work history matters, and published 
                for the Foundation by the Policy Press. The researchers found 
                that for men the effects of early exit from the labour market 
                depend on occupation and for women household type and marital 
                status seem to be more important. When it comes to policy implications, 
                the researchers suggest that to encourage individual saving and 
                pension provision will perpetuate income inequalities into old 
                age, and that to tackle such inequalities a substantial increase 
                in the flat-rate basic retirement pension would be required, which 
                would be costly. They suggest that only reducing inequalities 
                in family responsibilities and in the labour market earlier in 
                life would have any impact on inequalities in later life. </p>
              <p>The 2002 Budget set the rates for the new Working Tax Credit 
                and Child Tax Credit (which replace the Working Families Tax Credit). 
                Paul Bivand, writing in the May 2002 issue of Working Brief (the 
                journal of the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion), calculates 
                that the new credits will reduce disincentives in the labour market, 
                particularly for individuals over 25 and for couples without children. 
                He also points out that, because large numbers of people will 
                be in receipt of Child Tax Credit, claiming tax credits will become 
                the norm and take-up of other tax credits will improve. </p>

                There are clear differences between the paths into and through 
                social assistance in different countries, and to understand the 
                causes of these differences the contributors to this volume &quot;look 
                at how national and local systems 'construct' and select social 
                assistance recipients. This obviously involves looking at the 
                incidence of poverty and at the demographic and social characteristics 
                of the poor in the various countries and cities. It also involves 
                looking at patterns and criteria for entitlement to support in 
                the various national welfare systems. Finally, it means analysing 
                the nation-specific patterns, that is the varying combinations 
                and divisions of the spheres of social security and social assistance, 
                and the manner in which they impact, react to and shape the life 
                course of individuals&quot; (p.2). The authors' thesis is that 
                &quot;social assistance polices and the construction of the poor 
                and of the socially excluded as social categories are as much 
                a part of the process by which individuals and groups become poor 
                or socially excluded, and/or exit from poverty and social exclusion, 
                as labour market processes or family processes. They offer in 
                fact - to different degrees and with different outcomes depending 
                on the institutional framework, local cultures and circumstances 
                - social definitions as well as resources, opportunities as well 
                as constraints&quot; (pp.2f). Thus social assistance policies 
                can locate people in 'poverty'; but they can also keep them out 
                of it, and Saraceno mentions particularly child benefits in this 
                connection (on pp.3f and 17).<br>
                Most of the book relates detailed studies on cities as local systems, 
                on income support measures for the poor in European cities, on 
                why some people are more likely to be on social assistance than 
                others, and on paths through and out of social assistance. Together, 
                these studies suggest that &quot;countries &#133;. differ in at 
                least four dimensions: the existence or not of an explicit set 
                of policies addressing poverty; the degree of categorisation (or 
                universality) of assistance; whether income support is near pure 
                subsistence level or at a decent minimum; and the kinds of obligations 
                and controls attached to the status of beneficiary&quot; (pp.5f). 
                <br>
                The point of the project is to draw conclusions about the efficacy 
                of social assistance measures. Eight different social assistance 
                'regimes' are identified, and this diversity, alongside the varied 
                and detailed conclusions of the individual chapters, suggests 
                that it might be impossible to draw robust general conclusions 
                from the mass of data which the researchers employ. But whilst 
                detailed study of data cannot always offer positive generalisations, 
                it can sometimes question received wisdom, and an important result 
                of this study is &quot;the deconstruction of the myth of welfare 
                dependence&quot; (ch.6). The authors find no evidence of large-scale 
                long-term dependency on benefits; but they do find evidence that 
                benefits 'targeted' at the poor cause significantly more dependency 
                than universal benefits. As Saraceno writes: &quot;One of the 
                main findings of our study is that close targeting and low benefits 
                create a population of beneficiaries characterised by a high degree 
                of vulnerability and difficulty in becoming completely autonomous 
                from social assistance &#133;. In contrast, where benefits are 
                relatively generous, beneficiaries are more 'mixed' and the chances 
                of success higher, it is less likely that the presence of a certain 
                proportion of 'difficult' beneficiaries will have a strong stigmatising 
                effect on the whole population of recipients, and on the institution 
                of social assistance itself. Universalism and generosity would 
                therefore appear not only more appropriate to a citizenship culture, 
                since they lead to better social integration, but also more effective 
                in the medium-long term: in so far as they prevent people from 
                exhausting their resources and starting social assistance too 
                late to be successfully supported&quot; (pp.246f). And particular 
                problems are found with 'making work pay' benefits: &quot;Important 
                as it is to acknowledge that efforts must be made 'to make work 
                pay', the mechanisms involved in means-testing on a household 
                basis risks creating further vicious circles, particularly for 
                women. It can make it no longer worthwhile to work extra hours 
                or to have an additional worker/earner in the household. This 
                negative incentive affects in particular two-parent households, 
                rendering them (and especially women) more, not less vulnerable 
                to poverty and social exclusion should something happen to the 
                couple's relationship. Paradoxically, this occurs in the same 
                country, the UK, in which the New Deal for Lone Parents strongly 
                encourages lone mothers to take up paid work as a way of better 
                protecting themselves and their children financially, and being 
                better integrated socially&quot; (pp.253f).<br>
                This book is essential reading for anyone interested in the reform 
                of tax and benefits. If there is a second edition, then two additions 
                would be useful: 1. The emphasis is on benefits, and a section 
                on the move to tax credits and on other welfare-related functions 
                of the tax system would help the reader towards a more complete 
                understanding of the relationship between fiscal instruments and 
                social dynamics. 2. There are plenty of pointers towards what 
                might be more constructive benefits regimes, and particularly 
                the evidence which points to universal benefits creating less 
                dependency than means-tested benefits do; and for the book to 
                argue from this material towards a prescription for the kind of 
                social assistance system we might need if we wish to reduce welfare 
                dependency would be to do policy-makers a major service. A discussion 
                of the feasibility or otherwise of an EU-wide child benefit and/or 
                citizen's income might form part of such an addition.</p>

                This book has the wrong title. It is entirely about equality: 
                the roots of the idea, the importance of it, the lack of it, and 
                how we might embody it. The book should have been called On Equality.<br>
                Forrester begins with anecdote from India, he prints a diary which 
                recounts a life of poverty, and he tells the stories Jesus told; 
                but he also deals with complex theological, economic and sociological 
                literature; and it is all about equality or the lack of it. It 
                is not just about poverty: it is about inequality and the importance 
                of equality.<br>
                The book discusses the meanings of equality, poverty and social 
                exclusion; it finds the roots of the pursuit of equality in the 
                Judaeo-Christian tradition; it discusses the history of equality; 
                and it asks what we, the Church, and the State can do to promote 
                equality.<br>
                What will interest readers of this newsletter most is that in 
                this comprehensive and well-researched book social security is 
                discussed in somewhat vague terms, and it is not well related 
                to the main line of argument, whereas health care is discussed 
                in close relation to the concept of equality and the NHS is treated 
                as a paradigm of equality-based social policy. Child Benefit is 
                neither in the text nor in the index - yet surely this is the 
                paradigm, creating an element of absolute equality across the 
                entire child population. Forrester has read Tony Atkinson, Bill 
                Jordan and Philippe van Parijs (though perhaps not as much of 
                their writings as he might have done), but not Tony Walter or 
                Hermione Parker. There is no recognition of the existence of debate 
                on the extension of universal benefits as a means of enabling 
                people to become autonomous citizens in charge of their own economic 
                destinies.<br>
                This is not to complain that Forrester has somehow got it wrong; 
                it is rather to say that there is something fundamentally flawed 
                about social policy debate in this country. Central to that debate 
                are education and health (and Forrester offers significant material 
                on education, even though in the conclusion he tells us that he 
                hasn't done so). As Forrester shows, vital to the reduction of 
                health inequalities and many other social ills is income equality: 
                yet public debate on the nature of our tax and benefits system, 
                and of the options facing it, is rarely heard, and, when it is 
                heard, it is conducted in na&iuml;ve terms ('means-testing' and 
                'targeting' are not synonymous) and with little relation to the 
                detail of the system being discussed or to the precise likely 
                effects of options considered. There has been almost no public 
                debate about the move to tax credits. Why not? Because we regard 
                these as technical issues with little to do with the fundamental 
                structures of our society. They are not. They determine how we 
                shall live together as a society.<br>
                Forrester's book is a passionate book, which is why it is a pity 
                that the title does not evoke the passion which On Equality might 
                have evoked.<br>
                What is needed now is an equally passionate book about tax and 
                social security: about why they matter, about how they currently 
                contribute to poverty, social exclusion and inequality, and about 
                how this situation might be put right.<br>

                (ISSA, 2001).<br>
                Relevant reports are on telecommunications, performance management, 
                pay as you go pensions, poverty, trends in family protection, 
                research, and managing pension schemes. The reports describe the 
                situation, outline issues for discussion and future work, and 
                give useful lists of references.<br>
                However, little if any of the discussion is on the linkage between 
                longer term policy change and the detail of the issues discussed. 
                For instance, in relation to technology: the issues discussed 
                in relation to telecommunications and computerisation would look 
                very different if the aim were to establish universal benefits 
                or tax credits, neither of which receives a mention. <br>
                The final three reports, on 'social security for all', are particularly 
                relevant to readers of this newsletter. The first of these, on 
                the diversity of systems in developed countries and on how these 
                are not always appropriate in developing countries, suggests that 
                &quot;a variety of different approaches combining conventional 
                social insurance, social assistance, state and private sector 
                provisioning, and schemes operated by membership-based organizations 
                and voluntary agencies, will be needed,&quot; (report by Dharam 
                Ghai, p.13). But the logic of the argument suggests that such 
                schemes are not necessarily appropriate, and that all options 
                should be considered: presumably with universal child benefits 
                and a small citizen's pension among them.<br>
                In the second of these reports, a multi-pillar scheme for pension 
                provision is suggested to meet the diverse needs of different 
                parts of the labour force. A greater diversity would be contributed 
                by a flat-rate tax-funded citizen's pension (as in the Netherlands), 
                but this option is not explicitly explored.<br>
                The third of these reports identifies the difficulty of collecting 
                tax in the developing world as a problem related to universal 
                benefit schemes. A question not addressed is whether the implementation 
                of universal benefit schemes might not improve the state's ability 
                to collect tax by linking the administration of a citizen's income 
                to the collection of tax on all other income.<br>

                with a quote from Samuel Brittan: &quot;The government plans to 
                bring together, in 2003, support for children into an integrated 
                child credit, while in-work support for adults will be consolidated 
                into an employment tax credit. The net result will be close to 
                a negative income tax subject to a 'willing to work' test.&quot; 
                <br>
                The paper outlines the background and purposes of the Employment 
                Tax Credit (ETC), analyses the proposal, sets out a range of issues 
                raised by its introduction, and examines some general implications 
                of trying to tackle these issues within the framework of an ETC.<br>
                The current Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) is a tax credit 
                for families with children, and the Disabled Person's Tax Credit 
                (DPTC) is a tax credit for people with disabilities. In 2003, 
                the children's elements in these will be combined with other payments 
                for children to form the Child Tax Credit, and what's left of 
                WFTC and DPTC will be integrated with each other to create a tax 
                credit for adults which will be extended to people without children.<br>
                As with the WFTC, the ETC will be means-tested against family 
                income and will be withdrawn as income rises; and, like WFTC, 
                it will be delivered through the pay-packet.<br>
                The authors suggest that to extend an employment tax credit to 
                all working adults ( - though effectively only to low-paid working 
                adults because of the credit's withdrawal as income rises) might 
                create disincentives where they do not currently exist: &quot;It 
                would be unfortunate if the deployment of a particular safety 
                net discouraged behaviour that might reduce the need to use it&quot; 
                (p.10). Whilst recognising that the ETC will increase the incomes 
                of some low-paid adults, the authors are concerned that wages 
                might end up lower (because low wages will be subsidised by ETC), 
                that means-testing might reduce people's willingness to seek new 
                skills, that it could deter one partner from seeking employment 
                (because the amount paid will be based on a family means test), 
                and that new complexities will be added to an already over-complex 
                tax and benefits system.<br>
                A particular concern is that take-up will not be 100% (take-up 
                of WFTC is already low, largely because employees don't want employers 
                to know their financial situation); another is that small employers 
                will find administration of the system burdensome; another that 
                the family means test will affect intra-family relationships across 
                a broader range of family types than WFTC and DPTC do between 
                them; and yet another is that shifting family patterns will create 
                administrative problems.<br>
                The paper explores issues related to details which the government 
                will need to consider: for instance, if there is a cut-off at 
                a particular number of hours worked, then employment patterns 
                will be changed by the tax credit. If the taper is sharp, then 
                many people might reduce their hours to below the threshold.<br>
                The major problem, though, is that of incentives: &quot;Whatever 
                the structure of the ETC, it is impossible to escape entirely 
                the effect on incentives and opportunities of encouraging people 
                to work for earnings that need to be topped up on a means-tested 
                basis in order to create an acceptable standard of living. Under 
                a system of means-tested supplementation, attempts to overcome 
                disincentives are inevitably traded off against other objectives, 
                such as responsiveness, ease of administration and lack of intrusiveness 
                for claimants,&quot; (pp.21f). <br>
                The paper suggests that a major reason for ETC is the government's 
                desire to reduce the number of people receiving cash benefits 
                (though the new Child Tax Credit is to be paid as a benefit to 
                the main carer), and also suggests that the distinction between 
                receiving money as a cash benefit and receiving it through the 
                tax system is more important to the government than to claimants. 
                <br>
                The authors' conclusion is that &quot;all the difficulties suggest 
                that the problems thrown up by the ETC are not easy to overcome 
                through policy design, since they represent certain dilemmas inherent 
                to the fundamental characteristics of in-work means-tested support. 
                Even where it is possible to solve one problem, either wholly 
                or partially, the solution may create another&quot; (p.27). Their 
                solution to the problems which ETC is intended to address would 
                be to increase the minimum wage, to encourage investment in human 
                capital, to offer advice beyond the New Deals, to emphasise women's 
                working opportunities, to review treatment of part-time work, 
                and to subsidise in-work costs such as childcare.<br>
                The conclusion points out that by 2003 two fifths of households 
                will be on means-tested benefits or means-tested tax credits. 
                The authors counsel against extending means-testing in this fashion: 
                &quot;Whilst the government's first priority may have had to be 
                addressing the symptoms of in-work poverty, it should now be focusing 
                on addressing its causes. Means-tested in-work supplementation 
                is likely, we believe, to make at best a limited contribution 
                to these longer-term tasks,&quot; (pp.38f).<br>
                ('Part II' contains 'further evidence and arguments presented 
                at a JRF seminar on ETC on the 14th May 2001.' This should have 
                been called an appendix. Donald Hirsch's and Fran Bennett's paper 
                contains many of the main paper's findings; Frank Wilkinson's 
                historical reflections offer useful background on wage subsidisation; 
                and Mark Pearson and Stefano Scarpetta discuss the employment 
                and distributional effects of 'making work pay' policies.)<br>
                On page 37 the 'participation income' suggested by Tony Atkinson 
                gets a brief mention. What doesn't get a mention is the fact that 
                universal benefits such as Child Benefit don't exhibit the problems 
                associated with means-tested tax credits, that they cohere with 
                the authors' suggestion that too much means-testing is bad for 
                incentives, and that they would contribute constructively to the 
                authors' preferred solution to the problems to which the government 
                believes ETC to be a solution.<br>
                The Joseph Rowntree Foundation is to be congratulated on this 
                accessible, interesting, well-argued and constructive paper. What 
                would now be welcome would be a follow-up asking whether such 
                approaches as a participation income, a negative income tax or 
                a citizen's income might be preferable to the current increasing 
                reliance on means-tested tax credits.<br>

                In this book an international group of researchers use European 
                Community Household Panel data to explore the extent and nature 
                of social exclusion in Europe. They concentrate on six countries: 
                Austria and Germany (with 'corporatist' welfare states characterised 
                by status-preserving benefit regimes aimed at families), Norway 
                (with a 'social-democratic' welfare system characterised by high 
                levels of benefit aimed at individuals and funded out of taxation), 
                the UK (with a 'liberal' welfare state characterised by low flat-rate 
                and means-tested benefits) and Greece and Portugal (with rudimentary 
                welfare states characterised by minimal welfare policies) - though 
                they recognise that no country's system is a pure type, and that 
                rapid social and economic change is causing change in every country's 
                tax and benefit system.<br>
                In chapter 1, Matt Barnes defines social exclusion as multi-dimensional, 
                dynamic, relational and disruptive of social relationships, and 
                he locates this study in the context of other recent studies; 
                in chapter 2, Panos Tsakloglou and Fotis Papadopoulos discuss 
                the methodology which the researchers use to investigate the extent 
                and kinds of social exclusion and its relationship to low incomes; 
                in chapters 3 to 6 Sue Middleton, Jane Millar and Chris Heady 
                look in detail at four at-risk groups: young adults, lone parents, 
                sick and disabled people, and retired people. In the final chapter 
                Chris Heady and Graham Room discuss policy implications.<br>
                In each chapter, data is carefully discussed, detailed conclusions 
                are drawn, and over-generalisations are avoided. Of particular 
                interest to contemporary debate in this country is Jane Millar's 
                conclusion to the chapter on lone parenthood, in which she points 
                out that policy is moving away from the 'male breadwinner' to 
                the 'adult worker', and concludes from the data and her discussion 
                of it that &quot;employment does not &#133;.. always protect against 
                poverty. Support for working parents - in both cash and kind - 
                will also be required, if poverty in work is to be avoided&quot; 
                (p.100). In relation to Europe as a whole, Sue Middleton draws 
                the conclusion that &quot;whilst the extent of poverty in old 
                age varies from country to country, those who experience it are 
                the same - the oldest and those living alone&quot; (p.145), and 
                Christopher Heady concludes that &quot;policies in all countries 
                have not prevented sick and disabled people from experiencing 
                greater deprivation than other adults&quot; (p.122). These are 
                all things which we thought we knew. In this book we have data, 
                analysis and discussion which ground the conclusions in solid 
                evidence.<br>
                The final chapter draws careful and detailed conclusions from 
                the study as a whole. One general conclusion is that educational 
                achievement and employment help to prevent poverty, and another 
                is that those who live alone are more likely to experience poverty. 
                'Employability' and 'equal opportunities' are already high on 
                the European Union's agenda, and the authors conclude that the 
                results of their research show that it should stay that way. Three 
                particular issues which the European Commission are currently 
                discussing are the individualisation of social rights, the combining 
                of minimum income benefits with active pathways into the labour 
                market, and the sustainability of public pension schemes. The 
                authors rightly state that their research and findings are relevant 
                to these discussions. <br>
                The authors do not make specific policy recommendations: they 
                clearly did not understand this to be their brief. But if it is 
                true that household-based means-tested or contributory benefits 
                are not going to promote ease of access to the labour market, 
                equal opportunities, the individualisation of social rights, or 
                income security in old age, and that individualised non-means-tested 
                benefits are bound to do so, then at least a tentative suggestion 
                that future policy discussion might run along these lines would 
                have been in order.<br>
                This is a book packed full of data, high-quality discussion and 
                justifiable conclusions. Highly recommended for anyone interested 
                in the debate on poverty and social exclusion in Europe.</p>
