                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">There's 
                      not much that isn't global now: companies, the internet, 
                      capital movement, and culture are all global to a large 
                      extent And where things are not global they are continental: 
                      tariff-free trade is developing as a continental phenomenon; 
                      people from one EU country can now in principle be employed 
                      in any other; and currencies are increasingly continental.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">But 
                      tax and benefits are stuck in a nation-state time-warp. 
                      Although there<i> are</i> arguments for retaining nation-state 
                      responsibility for tax and benefits (such as a chancellor's 
                      ability to use tax levels as fiscal instruments), the increasing 
                      mobility of labour and goods, and existing EU controls over 
                      VAT, suggest that tax and benefits should no longer be national 
                      concerns, but that the proper level of subsidiarity is the 
                      continental.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">An 
                      obvious first step towards a European tax and benefits policy 
                      is a European Citizen's Income, which could easily function 
                      alongside continuing national provision. Comment on this

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Many 
                      individuals and groups have been trying to promote the idea 
                      of Basic Income in their communities, but the country that 
                      is furthest ahead in this ambition in Europe is the Republic 
                      of Ireland, with the publication of 'Basic Income, A Green 
                      Paper' by the Department of the Taoiseach (the Irish prime 
                      minister), in October 2002.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      enlightened state of affairs is due in large measure to 
                      the sustained efforts of two very dedicated workers, Se&aacute;n 
                      Healy and Brigid Reynolds. For more than twenty years, Healy 
                      and Reynolds have worked for the Conference of Religious 
                      of Ireland (CORI - pronounced 'COR-EYE', not 'Corry'), as 
                      co-directors of CORI's Justice Office in Dublin.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      addition to their other duties, Healy and Reynolds together 
                      have written or edited on average one small book every year 
                      for the Justice Commission, and they have amassed an impressive 
                      joint publications list. Their initial work in the 1980s, 
                      always in the socio-economic arena, covered many topics 
                      including 'work and unemployment', 'education' and 'health 
                      and healthcare'. In the late 1980s, they edited two books 
                      on 'poverty and family income policy' and 'poverty and taxation 
                      policy', and, since then, they have produced a whole series 
                      of books and papers in which Basic Income has been the central 
                      theme. A list of the key publications in this progression 
                      is given in the bibliography below.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      an inspiring talk to the delegates at the Basic Income European 
                      Network in Amsterdam in 1998, Se&aacute;n Healy described 
                      his 'road map' for persuading the Irish people to change 
                      their perceptions. He said that a) one must show people 
                      what is wrong with their present society and policies; b) 
                      one must give them a vision of how their society could be, 
                      and c), one must show how to move from a) to b), filling 
                      in the details at each stage. Throughout his talk, and implicit 
                      in all their joint writings, was an emphasis on the values 
                      of compassion and justice that underlie their vision. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      an interview with Healy and Reynolds last Autumn, they shared 
                      with me some clues to the success of their campaign.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      addition to being clear as to the underlying values which 
                      inform their work, Healy and Reynolds also have a<b> thorough 
                      grounding in the technical side</b> of Basic Income, which, 
                      in spite of the simplicity of the basic idea, has ramifying 
                      effects on different aspects of the economy, depending on 
                      the other economic instruments with which it is combined.

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">They 
                      said that having a <b>specific scheme</b> to recommend, 
                      and with which to illustrate their ideas, was very important, 
                      although the actual figures changed over time as the economy 
                      grew. They have <b>involved many people </b>in different 
                      aspects of their program, and were gratified at the number

                      both as privilege and as punishment, and look at the four

                      made a commitment to introduce a Green paper on Basic Income 
                      within two years. This was important as it ensured that 
                      work on Basic Income would be considered within the official 
                      policy-making process of Government, and the results would 
                      be made public.<br>

                      the picture. The first part is about some of the main social

                      poverty, unemployment, increasing inequality of income distribution,

                      in October 2002, came the jewel in the crown. The Taoiseach's 
                      Office produced their long awaited Green Paper on Basic 
                      Income. CORI arranged a press conference for the launch 
                      and several people from distant lands congregated for the 
                      event, including from Geneva, the UK and the USA. A presentation 
                      was given by Deaglan O' Briain of the Department of the 
                      Taoiseach, and Se&aacute;n Healy responded on behalf of 
                      CORI. The content of the Green Paper draws heavily on the 
                      work on BI already carried out by or for CORI, and this 
                      is acknowledged in its bibliography. The recommended rates 
                      are now expressed in euros per week. &quot;The Government's 
                      target is to achieve a rate of 150 euros per week (in 2002 
                      terms) for the lowest rates of social welfare to be met 
                      by 2007&quot; (p.5). That sum, 150 euros, is roughly equal 
                      to &pound;100, depending on the exact exchange rate.<br>

                      who has been the main economist collaborating with CORI

                      an economics book, the meat of which examines &quot;how 
                      a Basic Income system &#133; will affect the competitiveness 
                      of the Irish economy, the labour market and the distribution

                      the values are made explicit and are compassionate and just.

                      Steven Webb MP, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Work and 
                      Pensions, published in November 2002 a statement, Priorities 
                      for Pensions, reiterating and updating the Party's policies 
                      in the General Election campaign of 2001. The main feature 
                      is to increase the State retirement pension for single pensioners 
                      aged 65 to 74 by &pound;5 per week, for those aged 75 to 
                      79 by &pound;10 per week and for those over 80 by &pound;15 
                      per week. Couples would qualify according to the age of 
                      the elder for increases of &pound;8, &pound;18 and &pound;28 
                      per week respectively.<br>

                      is intended to help older pensioners, who are more likely 
                      to be in poverty. However, anyone entitled to the Minimum 
                      Income Guarantee under Income Support who already claims 
                      it will be no better off, except in a few special cases 
                      where other income added to State pension is currently slightly 
                      below Guarantee level. The main beneficiaries will be those, 
                      estimated at about one third, who could claim the Minimum 
                      Income Guarantee but do not do so because of pride, ignorance 
                      or frustration with the bureaucracy of applying. The other 
                      beneficiaries will be richer pensioners who do not qualify 
                      for Income Support at all.<br>

                      increases are not enough to eliminate the need for means 
                      testing. It is proposed that they should be paid for by 
                      not implementing the Pension Credit to be introduced in 
                      October 2003, on the grounds that this extends means testing, 
                      and again only about two thirds of those entitled would 
                      claim it. This long overdue reform is essential because 
                      it abolishes the offsetting of an absurdly high notional 
                      income on capital over &pound;6000 and effectively taxes 
                      pensioners' income from other pensions and savings at only 
                      60% instead of 100%. The Liberal Democrat Treasury team 
                      concede that the Pension Credit could not be abolished after 
                      people had begun to receive it, so the Party's policy on 
                      the State pension will have to be completely rethought. 
                      A pensions policy group is being formed now to prepare an 
                      outline policy on the whole subject of pensions for consultation 
                      from September 2003 and final adoption in September 2004.<br>

                      Webb has also denounced the alleged injustice to married 
                      women who exercised their option in 1978 to continue National 
                      Insurance contributions at a reduced rate which did not 
                      entitle them to pensions in their own right and now of course 
                      find that they have none.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      problem was not that these women were misled about their 
                      pension expectations but that their reduced contributions 
                      were for other benefits such as in unemployment or sickness 
                      whose contributory basis has since been largely eroded. 
                      However, the policy arising from this indignation is the 
                      reasonable one that all such women still below pension age 
                      should be told how much pension they can expect and be allowed 
                      to pay additional contributions in arrear.<br>

                      other main policy is to abolish all new entitlements to 
                      the State second pension and thereby scrap the whole bureaucracy 
                      of contracting out. Existing entitlements to SERPS and to 
                      the State second pension would be honoured and the extra 
                      benefits for low earners, carers and disabled people would 
                      be transferred to the basic State pension. Instead there 
                      would be a mandatory employer contribution to a second pension 
                      (occupational, stakeholder or personal) for everyone with 
                      earnings above a low threshold, with additional contributions

                      that more of the fund goes to members and less in fees, 
                      to require the same consultation of employees about changes 
                      in pension arrangements as in pay and other conditions, 
                      to scrap the requirement to buy an annuity by the age of 
                      75 and to allow people drawing a pension from an employer 
                      to continue to work for that employer and not just only 
                      for others.</font></p>

                      the 6th April<b> tax credits</b> underwent some changes. 
                      The Child Tax Credit will replace the Children's Tax Credit, 
                      and will be paid direct to the main carer for those who 
                      fulfil entitlement conditions, unlike the Children's Tax 
                      Credit which was paid through the PAYE tax system. At the 
                      same time, the Working Tax Credit replaced the Working Families 
                      Tax Credit: the difference being that the Working Tax Credit 
                      is paid to families without children as well as to families 
                      with them, whereas the Working Families Tax Credit was only 
                      paid to families with children. One consequence of the new 
                      Child Credit will be that from later this year or early 
                      next year allowances for children will no longer be paid 
                      through Income Support, income-based Jobseekers' Allowance, 
                      Minimum Income Guarantee, and some other benefits. Also 
                      later this year the Pension Credit will replace the Minimum 
                      Income Guarantee for pensioners, thus enabling pensioners 
                      to benefit to some extent from small amounts of savings, 
                      occupational pension or private pension. In most cases, 
                      the new tax credits will be paid into bank accounts (including 
                      the new Post Office card account). Information on these 
                      changes is available at <a href="http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/taxcredits">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/taxcredits</a>.

                      and on the 1st April 2003, responsibility for Child Benefit

                      Centre for Economic Performance</b>, at the London School 
                      of Economics, has received the Queen's Anniversary Prize 
                      for Higher and Further Education in recognition of &quot;excellence 
                      in the application of economic theory and rigorous empirical 
                      analysis to issues of unemployment, productivity, education 
                      and international trade.&quot; Particularly important pieces 
                      of research at the Centre during the past ten years have 
                      shown that a not too large National Minimum Wage would not 
                      reduce employment, and that reducing long-term unemployment 
                      does not increase inflation in the same way that some policies 
                      aimed at reducing short-term unemployment might do. Recent 
                      research has shown that the number of vacancies and the 
                      number of people unemployed are not necessarily inversely 
                      proportional: indeed, they tend to be proportional, rather 
                      suggesting that helping people into employment (for instance, 
                      by enabling older people to remain in employment) reduces 
                      unemployment and the number of vacancies, which helps to 
                      reduce inflation (because high vacancy levels contribute 
                      to inflation). Other recent research has shown that the 
                      labour market is not a classical market, that it exhibits 
                      many of the characteristics of 'monopsony' (i.e., a market 
                      in which there is only one purchaser), which suggests that 
                      there is scope for regulation (national minimum wage, working 
                      hours limits, etc.). Further details on the Centre's research

                      contribution from Tim Flynn emerges from the many-faceted 
                      debate on a Citizen's Income within the Green Party. The 
                      scheme in question is a full Citizen's Income of &pound;500 
                      per month, which of course isn't the only Citizen's Income 
                      Scheme on offer, but it raises some important issues: Is 
                      a CI affordable ? Would a CI be regarded by the World Trade 
                      Organisation as the kind of subsidisation of wages which 
                      calls in question the UK's membership of the WTO ? Would 
                      a CI, by increasing people's purchasing power, cause inflation?

                      Luis Rey P&eacute;rez, from Spain, studies the connection 
                      between a Citizen's Income and primary needs, and the connection 
                      between a Citizen's Income and 'radical' needs (i.e. those 
                      needs we experience consequent upon choices we make about 
                      the lives we intend to lead), and concludes that, while 
                      a Citizen's Income is not itself a human right, it is a 
                      good, and perhaps the best, guarantee of the right to subsistence 
                      and of the right to choose and develop different lifestyles.</font><br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      is going to be a most useful book, mainly because its aim 
                      is realistic. It explores the ways in which (mainstream) 
                      economic theory relates to social policy generally and to 
                      policy on health, pensions, the labour market, families, 
                      children and gender in particular; but it also recognises 
                      that national and individual decisions in the welfare field 
                      (e.g., whether a nation should pay for health care through 
                      general taxation or through insurance schemes, or whether 
                      an individual should buy an annuity) are made on the basis 
                      of a wide variety of factors which economic theory does 
                      not necessarily explain.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Chapter 
                      1 contains an overview of social policy, and chooses to 
                      limit the field to health care, pensions, help for the unemployed, 
                      policies related to the family, and poverty. The author 
                      recognises that this diversity means that no unified theory 
                      is possible, and so he sets out a variety of presuppositions 
                      (for instance, that, on the whole, people make rational 
                      choices), and then in chapters 1 and 2 he offers a good, 
                      accessible summary of what would normally be taught as 'welfare 
                      economics': economic theory which might be applied to social 
                      policy. Chapter 3 looks in the other direction by asking 
                      first about the nature of social policy, and then how economic 
                      theory might apply to it. This two-directional approach 
                      provides a good basis for the detailed chapters on particular 
                      areas of social policy.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      author recognises that there are gaps: for instance, that 
                      the book is about developed countries, not poor ones: because, 
                      as he correctly argues, the problems faced are so different. 
                      He also recognises that amongst developed countries most 
                      of his material relates to Europe and the USA. He apologises 
                      for this. He doesn't need to: to include the USA and as 
                      many European countries as he does gives him plenty of diversity 
                      in terms of types of welfare state. But what is interesting 
                      is the location of 'poverty', and here two paragraphs from 
                      the preface are worth quoting:<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <blockquote> 
                      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;I 
                        am sure that in any survey about the foremost purpose 
                        of social policy, fighting poverty will be mentioned most 
                        frequently. Any attempt to curtail social policy programmes 
                        will be challenged by warning of the danger of increasing 
                        poverty, whereas extensions of programmes are argued by 
                        pointing at existing poverty. Nevertheless poverty is 
                        not at the heart of existing social policy programmes, 
                        particularly in Europe. The biggest programmes - measured 
                        by the amount of spending - apply to large segments of 
                        the population, if not the whole population: health provisions, 
                        pension systems, family allowances. Of course, all these 
                        systems are important for reducing poverty, but the rationale 
                        for their existence cannot be reduced to that aspect, 
                        not even in the USA, in Australia or in New Zealand, where 
                        European style social security programmes are of less 
                        importance.<br>
                        </font></p>
                      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I 
                        choose to present the material along the lines of the 
                        demarcation of the programmes - health services, pension 
                        systems, dealing with unemployment, supporting families. 
                        Fighting poverty as a separate programme is left for the 
                        last chapter, because in most countries poverty is reduced 
                        decisively by the aforementioned programmes, although 
                        they comprise (nearly) the whole population. Programmes 
                        which are aimed specifically at relieving poverty are 
                        nearly everywhere of small scale&quot; (pp. xivf).<br>

                    </blockquote>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      suggests that yet another final chapter is needed on the 
                      connections between health provision, pensions, etc. and 
                      the required alleviation of poverty, but there isn't one. 
                      Such a chapter would have revealed the importance of educational 
                      provision (missing from the author's definition of social 
                      policy), and it would have caused important connections 
                      to be drawn between policy on means-tested benefits, pensions, 
                      and unemployment benefit. It might also have led to consideration 
                      of the kind of policy which might address poverty across 
                      the boundaries set up in the book. Neither 'basic income' 
                      nor 'citizen's income' appears in the index, though they 
                      should have done, for there is a single line on p.319 which 
                      recognises that &quot;some want to replace [means-tested 
                      benefits] with a basic income.&quot;<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      book is as it is because it has grown out of the author's 
                      teaching experience. It is sensible, informed, well-argued, 
                      and clear, and there is a good balance between theory and 
                      the results of empirical research. It will prove to be a 
                      useful tool on undergraduate courses, and beyond, for it 
                      has good up-to-date bibliographies (though I couldn't find 
                      any reference to A. B. Atkinson's Public Economics: The 
                      Basic Income and Flat Tax Proposal: a book highly relevant 
                      to at least two of the chapters). For both teachers and 
                      students this will prove to be a valuable text-book; and 
                      for politicians, commentators, and others, it will be a 
                      helpful resource, showing how useful economic theory can 
                      be when social policy is discussed, and also what its proper 
                      limits are. But unfortunately it will only become a really 
                      useful book if a paperback edition is published at a rather 
                      lower price.<br>

                      except for their relationship with the title of the book. 
                      This is not the case here. This substantial collection of 
                      papers has resulted from the authors' co-operation on the 
                      EU-funded project entitled 'Social Exclusion and Social 
                      Protection: The Future Role of the EU' (EXSPRO). The project's 
                      researchers have sought connections between economic performance, 
                      labour market performance, and social inclusion/exclusion, 
                      and the book &quot;explores the role and performance of 
                      welfare states and employment regimes in preventing and 
                      combating income poverty, relative deprivation and social

                      I is on 'labour market integration in European employment 
                      regimes', and it tackles macroeconomic factors which contribute 
                      to social exclusion, employment regimes, and the flexibilisation 
                      of labour markets. Part II is on 'social exclusion in European 
                      welfare states', and there are papers on identifying high-risk 
                      groups, the nature of social exclusion, the measurement 
                      of poverty, and the ways in which different welfare regimes 
                      affect levels and types of social exclusion. Part III draws 
                      lessons for European social policy, mainly in relation to 
                      employment regimes and such labour market policies as the 
                      USA's experiment with workfare, which, in the view of Waltraud

                      concluding chapter concentrates on ways of encouraging people 
                      into the labour market. It notes that welfare regimes with 
                      less developed social security systems and strong employment 
                      protection regulations (and thus low turnover) are particularly 
                      bad at reducing unemployment, leading to the recommendation 
                      that &quot;reinforcing the incentive structure of the system 
                      is still important in its own right as a means of fostering 
                      economic growth and employment creation&quot; (p.328). But 
                      'incentive structure' can mean a variety of things, and 
                      what has been discussed just before this quotation is Denmark's 
                      &quot;activation and workfare strategy&quot; (p.328). What 
                      is largely absent from the discussion, and from the collection 
                      as a whole, is detailed discussion of how particular benefits 
                      systems affect labour market incentives. This is not surprising, 
                      as social security systems are an entirely national issue. 
                      But the concluding chapter recognises that this is a problem, 
                      with the implication that a little more EU involvement in 
                      an issue which impacts on the mobility of labour throughout 
                      the economic community might not be a bad thing.<br>

                      types would provide the necessary labour market incentives 
                      and would otherwise reduce social exclusion, and whether

                      author employs the term 'free lunch' to describe any &quot;gift 
                      of nature which existed before human society began&quot; 
                      (p.4) - for instance, the oil which gives to Alaskans their 
                      social dividend, and land value gains due to location or 
                      discounted council house sales. He explores peoples' expectations 
                      of free lunches (e.g., from the lottery) - and, of course, 
                      the inequitable distribution of free lunches (as in the 
                      'lottery principle', the societal process by which the poor 
                      create free lunches for the rich). Following a chapter on 
                      the 'fairness' developed amongst early Israelites, through 
                      such rules as the cancellation of debt every fiftieth year, 
                      Bazlinton introduces the 'Citizen's Royalty': a Citizen's 
                      Income modelled on Alaska's. The usual arguments are rehearsed 
                      (and particularly the alleviation of the unemployment trap 
                      and the opportunity for families to plan employment and 
                      childcare more flexibly). A land value tax is suggested 
                      as a funding mechanism, and C.H. Douglas's ideas on social 
                      credit (central bank control of money creation and the diversion 
                      of profit from money creation to fund the Citizen's Royalty) 
                      are also discussed. Further chapters follow on land value 
                      and its taxation (a particular interest of the author, who 
                      is a surveyor), and then material on business cycles and 
                      stakeholders, citizenship, and much else.<br>

                      book tackles a fundamental issue facing welfare states in 
                      developed countries: Why, when so much is spent on poverty 
                      alleviation, is poverty still so prevalent? - and it tackles 
                      the question by examining minimum income schemes. As the 
                      author says, &quot;these schemes are explicitly designed 
                      for the purpose of alleviating poverty and are ultimately 
                      responsible for guaranteeing an adequate standard of living&quot; 
                      (p.2). The author is correct to suggest that other aspects 
                      of welfare states have been at the centre of academic attention 
                      - mainly the overall design of tax and benefit regimes, 
                      and social insurance systems. Her focus is means-tested 
                      safety nets in Germany, Sweden and the UK, and the book 
                      is packed with information and commentary. For any student 
                      specialising in this particular aspect of welfare states, 
                      this book is now the place to start. It will also be helpful 
                      to a wider category of students in terms of its discussion 
                      of methods for studying social policy and its impact.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      results suggest that in none of the countries considered 
                      has the safety net proved effective. One chapter asks whether 
                      this might be due to problems with the data or with the 
                      definitions of poverty, but most of the book asks about 
                      the design of the systems and the ways in which other social 
                      realities might affect outcomes. &quot;Three possible causes 
                      may explain the ineffectiveness of minimum income schemes 
                      in the alleviation of poverty: some groups of the population 
                      may not be entitled to receive benefits from these schemes; 
                      benefits may not be generous enough to push households over 
                      the poverty line; or benefits are not fully taken up by 
                      the eligible population&quot; (p.11). Thus means-tested 
                      schemes are tested for eligibility, adequacy and take-up. 
                      In none of the three countries considered is eligibility 
                      strictly universal; in the United Kingdom benefit levels 
                      are not adequate; and take-up is poor, especially in Germany 
                      and Sweden - and here the design of the schemes is the problem, 
                      and particularly the intrusiveness of means-testing. Behrendt 
                      recommends that in Sweden, with high benefit levels but 
                      few disregards, benefit levels should be lower and disregards 
                      higher in order to encourage take-up. In the UK, she recommends 
                      higher benefit levels. In Germany, she recommends the abolition 
                      of extended-family liability, and a reduction in administrative 
                      discretion. A particularly important recommendation is that 
                      systems should be designed so as to facilitate entry into 
                      and exit from the system, and this requires disregards for 
                      earned income.<br>

                      book certainly fills a gap, and it is a thorough and accessible 
                      study of a little-researched field, and should be in every 
                      social policy library. (It's a pity it's not cheaper. A 
                      paperback edition would enable students of income maintenance 
                      policy to own their own copies so that they could refer 
                      to them as necessary). <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">What 
                      is needed now is another book, and I hope that the author 
                      will provide it. The book under consideration is correctly 
                      entitled 'At the Margins of the Welfare State'. That is: 
                      minimum income (means-tested) schemes are after-thoughts 
                      needed to patch up what's not working. But these after-thoughts 
                      affect the ways in which policy is made about social insurance 
                      and universal benefits, and social insurance schemes and 
                      universal benefits affect the ways in which minimum income 
                      schemes are designed and operate. So what we need now is 
                      a volume which studies the relationships between social 
                      insurance, universal benefits (such as Child Benefit) and 
                      means-tested systems, the ways in which they impact on each 
                      other, and the ways in which the relationships between them 
                      affect labour market participation. To study minimum income 
                      schemes on their own gives a useful picture but only half 
                      a picture. Also, study of different systems together would 
                      bring the UK's tax credits into view. Behrendt doesn't deal 
                      with these, presumably having decided that they are not 
                      a means-tested benefit; but they are, of course, and they 
                      pose many of the problems faced by other means-tested benefits 
                      and also additional problems, such as the difficulties of 
                      employer administration and the complexities faced by people 
                      with rapidly-changing employment status.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">To 
                      tackle the different parts of the system together would 
                      lead Behrendt to consider reform on a wider canvas. By choosing 
                      to tackle means-tested benefits on their own she is automatically 
                      led into discussing reforms to means-tested benefits. To 
                      discuss the system as a whole would lead her to suggest 
                      reforms relating to the balance between the means-tested, 
                      universal and social insurance elements of a system. Such 
                      a project would not be simple, because it would be far from 
                      easy to create an orderly and accessible conceptual structure 
                      within which to marshal the relevant data and to discuss 
                      it; but it would result in a book well worth reading. We 
                      commend the project to author and publisher.</font></p>

                      Foundation's centenary in 2004. Using the normal poverty-line 
                      of 60% of median income, it finds that over the past twenty 
                      years poverty has nearly doubled, so that now 14% of the

                      report studies the causes of poverty (such as a rise in 
                      the number of no-earner households, and a fall in the number 
                      of one-earner households); who is most affected is then 
                      discussed (with families with children having replaced pensioners 
                      as the largest group of people in poverty); and the extent 
                      to which income would need to be redistributed is calculated:

                      over the next 20 years. The bottom quintile could see an 
                      annual growth of 7% if other quintiles see only modest rises

                      second part of the report makes proposals in the fields 
                      of education, geographic differences in the labour market, 
                      housing, long-term care, and, of course, income poverty, 
                      and especially the poverty of families with children and 
                      the poverty of particularly vulnerable groups such as people 
                      with disabilities. The report commends the Government for 
                      implementing the Child Tax Credit, the New Deal for Lone 
                      Parents, and tax credits for childcare. But the authors 
                      note that progress will now slow down, as those who have 
                      been most helped by existing policies are mainly those near 
                      to the poverty threshold, i.e., low-income working families. 
                      It is those in the deepest poverty who will be the most 
                      difficult to lift above the poverty line. The report is 
                      right to say that external factors might make it difficult 
                      to sustain progress, and that &quot;courage and determination 
                      will be needed&quot; - but the logic of the argument suggests 
                      that new policies will be needed, not just the existing 
                      ones. Particular proposals are to ensure that the overall 
                      income of non-working families with children should rise 
                      relative to median incomes and that the causes of lack of 
                      take-up of Income Support and tax credits should be addressed.<br>

                      response: The first of these two proposals would deepen 
                      the poverty and unemployment traps and would make it more 
                      difficult for families with children to earn their way out 
                      of poverty; and the complexity of claiming Income Support 
                      and tax credits is bound to discourage take-up. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">A 
                      most sensible recommendation is that government and employers 
                      should provide choice to parents so that they can balance 
                      employment with the needs of their children; but it is the 
                      tax and benefits system which is the major cause of the 
                      rise in no-earner and two-earner families and the fall in 
                      the number of one-earner families, not employers, and the 
                      report makes no policy recommendations which would tackle 
                      this problem.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      relation to the growing numbers in vulnerable groups who 
                      are below the poverty line, the report recognises that reliance 
                      on means-tested benefits has increased. The authors correctly 
                      note that income guarantees &quot;work better if they are 
                      a back-up to other measures&quot; (p.32), otherwise incentives 
                      to earn or save are reduced. In addition, take-up rates 
                      are low for minimum income guarantees because of continuing 
                      stigma, so income is in practice not guaranteed for large 
                      numbers of pensioners and families with children. &quot;38% 
                      of those entitled are estimated not to claim Working Families 
                      Tax Credit and between 22 per cent and 36 per cent do not 
                      take up the Minimum Income Guarantee. This contrasts with 
                      near-universal take-up of non-means tested benefits such 
                      as Child Benefit and the State Retirement Pension&quot; 
                      (p.33). Quite so.<br>

                      report recommends that the introduction of a second state 
                      pension should be speeded up, that the main state pension 
                      should rise with earnings, and that tax credits for people 
                      with disabilities should not be withdrawn if they are in 
                      short-term or poorly-paid employment.<br>
                      The report's policy recommendations, when taken together 
                      (and the concluding section suggests that they should be 
                      taken together), would indeed help to reduce the numbers 
                      of people with incomes below 60% of median income, and Government 
                      and others will find the report useful.<br>

                      what the authors have not done is to ask whether policy 
                      change, rather than policy adaptation and enhancement, might 
                      not be the better way forward. In particular, a small and 
                      growing Citizen's Income would meet many of the authors' 
                      policy objectives, and without some of the attendant problems, 
                      such as poverty and unemployment traps and lack of take-up. 
                      Further work along these lines from the Joseph Rowntree

                      that between 1996/7 and 2000/1 there has been a small fall

                      number of children in poverty; and they attribute these

                      that further policy initiatives are required if the government

                      out to discover how accurately people understand the distribution 
                      of Government expenditure. The researchers discover that 
                      public perception is quite accurate as to how much is spent 
                      on major spending categories (with most people correctly 
                      recognising that government spends far more on social security 
                      benefits than on anything else), but less accurate in relation 
                      to spending distribution within major categories (for instance, 
                      public opinion wildly exaggerates the amounts spent on unemployed 
                      people and on single parents). From a second set of responses 
                      the researchers draw the conclusion that public perception 
                      exaggerates the size of such phenomena as crime involving 
                      violence and children in poverty (though the latter not 
                      by much). The authors discover some support for more redistributive 
                      policies (from half of the bottom quartile to a third of 
                      the top), but conclude that this is not sufficient support 
                      to enable the government to go very far in a redistributive 
                      direction. The article also contains evidence leading to 
                      the conclusion that the socio-economic characteristics of 
                      the respondent partly determine the respondent's knowledge

                      they must involve redistribution from better-off to worse-off 
                      groups) are likely to produce controversy&quot; (p.18).<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      research needs to be understood alongside a research project 
                      by David Smith Associates (Basic Income: A Research Report, 
                      April 1991, prepared for Age Concern England) which found 
                      that &quot;few respondents had a clear understanding of 
                      the current UK system of pensions and benefits. Respondents 
                      found the system confusing and unclear &#133;&#133; Respondents 
                      believed that there must be a better system, but felt the 
                      whole subject was too large for them to be able to offer 
                      suggestions as to how to improve it. Importantly, there 
                      was little evidence that people drawn from particular socio-economic 
                      groups were more knowledgeable than others. The lack of 
                      knowledge about the current system of pensions and benefits 
                      was a general problem that ran across all the groups included 
                      in the research&quot; (pp.13f). It is unlikely that this 
                      situation has changed much during the last ten years.<br>
                      It is not just knowledge and perception of how much is spent 
                      on different categories which matters; equally important 
                      is how much is known about the structure of the field: how 
                      the money is used, and not just how much is used. For the 
                      questions which the article's survey asks remain within 
                      parameters established by the way in which social security 
                      and taxation are currently organised, so responses will 
                      remain within these parameters too. Tax credits were introduced 
                      with practically no public comment or debate, which rather 
                      backs up the David Smith Associates findings, and rather 
                      suggests that if a government were ever to propose major 
                      reform of social security in the direction of universal 
                      benefits then there would be too small a public knowledge-base 
                      to enable intelligent debate to occur and that there would 
                      be little public comment if the change were made - and that 
                      there would be approving comment if the change made a difference 
                      to levels of child poverty, which it would.<br>
