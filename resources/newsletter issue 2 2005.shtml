                      2004 saw the publication of the most significant contribution 
                      to the debate on the desirability and feasibility of a Citizen's 
                      Income for several years: Towards a Citizen's Pension: Interim 
                      Report, prepared for the National Association of Pension 
                      Funds (NAPF) by the Pensions Policy Institute (PPI). <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      October 2002 NAPF recommended that the basis for reform 
                      of the state pension system should be a Citizen's Pension: 
                      a universal, nonwithdrawable income for every citizen over 
                      pension age, set at 22% of national average earnings (approximately 
                      &pound;105 a week in 2004). <br>
                      According to the Interim Report the benefits of a Citizen's 
                      Pension would be adequacy, simplicity, inclusion, encouragement 
                      to save, efficiency, and certainty, i.e., precisely the 
                      qualities required for a state pension designed to encourage 
                      people to create their own additional pension provision. 
                      No longer would people be left wondering whether it was 
                      worth their while to save for old age. They would know that 
                      it would be. And financial advisers would be far better 
                      able to advise clients on the net benefits which would accrue 
                      from private pension schemes. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      report outlines the solutions to some of the issues which 
                      transition to a Citizen's Pension would face (such as ensuring 
                      that employees contracted out of the State Second Pension 
                      and employees not contracted out are treated equally by 
                      applying the same offset to rights accrued in contracted-out 
                      schemes as will be applied to rights accrued in the State 
                      Second Pension). <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">There 
                      are issues which still require discussion. An issue which 
                      individuals have raised with us is the proposed residency 
                      criterion. There are people living abroad who have accrued 
                      rights in the UK's State Pension scheme by paying National 
                      Insurance contributions. A simple residency test would therefore 
                      need to be supplemented by transitional arrangements for 
                      people who have accrued rights in the present system. But 
                      these are minor issues, and both we and the PPI, and clearly 
                      other participants in the debate, believe that there are 
                      no issues which should prevent the implementation of a Citizen's 
                      Pension. As the PPI has shown, a Citizen's Pension is affordable 
                      within the current pensions budget.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">NAPF 
                      and the PPI are not the only participants in the recent 
                      debate. In 2003 the House of Lords Select Committee on Economic 
                      Affairs recommended a universal non-means-tested pension 
                      in its report Aspects of the Economics of an Ageing Population; 
                      in February 2004 the National Consumer Council, in their 
                      publication Retirement Realities, recommended a Citizen's 
                      Pension; in the spring of 2004 Alan Pickering's report for 
                      the Adam Smith Institute recommended a universal non-means-tested 
                      pension set at 40% of national average earnings; in September 
                      2004 the Association of British Insurers expressed the view 
                      that means-testing of pensions should be reduced; in February 
                      of this year Help the Aged recommended a Citizen's Pension 
                      in their report Pensions not Pin Money: Ensuring a decent 
                      retirement for all; and both in the House of Commons (on 
                      the 14th October 2004) and in interviews in the Telegraph 
                      (4th December) and the Guardian (29th December) the Rt. 
                      Hon. Alan Johnson, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, 
                      has expressed serious interest in implementing a Citizen's

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      purpose of a European Science Foundation Exploratory Workshop 
                      on the 18th September 2004 in Barcelona was to discuss the 
                      merits of a Basic Income/ negative income tax experiment 
                      in Europe and to comment upon the design of the experiment. 
                      For this reason experts in the field of randomized field 
                      experiments, income taxation, social security arrangements, 
                      gender issues, political scientists and philosophers were 
                      invited to participate in the workshop. In the introductory 
                      text to inform prospective participants, the following summary 
                      of the topic to be discussed at the workshop was offered:<br>
                      Any design for a new BI or NIT (Negative Income Tax) experiment 
                      in Europe should be informed by the NIT experiments in the 
                      USA which started in the late 1960s. Although the outcome 
                      of these experiments cannot be considered predictive for 
                      the expected effects of the introduction of a BI in Europe 
                      or even the USA today, some important lessons can be drawn 
                      for setting up a new experiment. Atkinson (in Atkinson, 
                      A.B. (1995), Public Economics in Action. The Basic Income/Flat 
                      Tax Proposal, Oxford, Clarendon Press, p.150) states that 
                      &quot;the NIT experiments are generally considered to have 
                      reduced the range of uncertainty surrounding the response 
                      of hours of work to taxation...&quot; However, &quot;... 
                      there is no necessary reason to expect the results to apply 
                      equally in a European context. Those interested in a BI/FT 
                      (BI/flat tax) scheme in Europe might like to consider launching 
                      such an experimental research project, which would serve 
                      both to throw light on the economic effects of the reform 
                      and to demonstrate how it would work in reality.&quot;<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      emphasis in the design of the experiment will be on the 
                      labour market effects. Will people work less or will some 
                      people even stop working? Will beneficiaries be more prepared 
                      to accept low paid or part-time jobs? Will non-participating 
                      partners ('housewives') seek and take more, or less, paid 
                      work? What will be the effects on the division of paid and 
                      unpaid work within the household? Will a BI cause interesting 
                      behavioural reactions in all sorts of other areas? Although 
                      the latter may not be crucial for the judgement of BI's 
                      feasibility, it is nonetheless worth watching. For instance, 
                      the effects of a BI on consumption patterns, family composition 
                      (living together or separate), role division between men 
                      and women, the way leisure time is spent and things like 
                      participating in voluntary work, social participation, etc., 
                      are all possible consequences worth taking into account.

                      idea behind the workshop was that it would be interesting 
                      to launch an experiment in one of the former 15 EU members 
                      as well as in one of the new member states from Eastern 
                      Europe. In designing the experiment many questions must 
                      be answered and decisions made: the levels of the income 
                      guarantee and the withdrawal rates; the number of questionnaires 
                      (a screening interview to determine eligibility, a pre-enrolment

                      interview after the experiment); the topics to be included

                      social networks) and other assorted topics (e.g. social 
                      status, self-esteem, worry and happiness, attitudes toward 
                      work, and job satisfaction); and finally, the content of

                      experiment.<br>

                      the workshop, Loek Groot provided the basic design of a 
                      Basic Income experiment. The lessons to be learned from 
                      the U.S. negative income tax experiments were taken care 
                      of by the contributions of Karl Widerquist, Rebecca Maynard 
                      and Robinson Hollister. Finally, Marx and Peeters explained 
                      why the study of Win for Life lotteries is interesting for 
                      Basic Income research. In what follows, I will concentrate 
                      on my own contribution and at the end refer to the results 
                      of the discussion.<br>
                      According to Loek Groot, the best selling point for a Basic 
                      Income experiment is that it offers the opportunity to measure 
                      more adequately the effectiveness of thousands of workfare-oriented 
                      experiments going on all over Europe. Comparing the results 
                      of Basic Income and workfare-oriented experiments will show 
                      what the net effect is of all kinds of 'make-work policies' 
                      compared to when it is left to the client group itself to 
                      decide what to do or not to do. Because there are no BI 
                      experiments going on, we can only guess what the differences 
                      would be. For instance, it may well be the case that workfare 
                      experiments show better results in terms of labour market 
                      inclusion, but that BI experiments show better results in 
                      terms of inclusion in all kinds of unpaid work. However, 
                      if labour demand is the short side of the market, it is 
                      likely that no large differences will emerge in labour market 
                      participation rates between the two groups. In any case, 
                      comparing the evaluation findings of workfare and BI experiments 
                      may give us crucial information about the effectiveness 
                      of welfare-to-work activities performed by welfare and employment 
                      agencies.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">For 
                      the Basic Income research, an experiment may provide additional 
                      information about the labour supply effects of introducing 
                      a Basic Income, thus reducing the radical uncertainty surrounding 
                      the Basic Income proposal. An experiment might also show 
                      which variant (e.g. combining guarantee level and withdrawal 
                      rate, providing it on a household or on an individual basis, 
                      disbursing it as a NIT or as a Basic Income) is the most 
                      promising. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      criteria used for the choice of groups to be included in 
                      the experiment are twofold. First, the emphasis of the experiment 
                      is to research the labour supply effects of the groups over 
                      which there is the greatest disagreement among labour economists 
                      about expected (negative) labour supply responses and which 
                      are of great importance for the feasibility of a BI. These 
                      groups are the social assistance recipients and the low 
                      wage workers. In addition, it might be interesting to include 
                      prospective entrepreneurs in the experiment. Second, the 
                      choice is influenced by the desirability of minimizing the 
                      cost of the experiment. Given the total budget for the experiment, 
                      the lower its cost per participant, the higher the number 
                      of participants and the longer the duration of the experiment 
                      can be. For this reason, a group of workers is included 
                      in the experiment who would not experience a change in net 
                      income if they take part in the experiment. If the participants 
                      in these groups do not change their labour supply, no extra 
                      costs for the experiment are incurred. Extra costs only 
                      occur when they decide to work less.<br>

                      basic design of the experiment entails the choice of the 
                      (possibly varying) guarantee level and the (varying) tax 
                      or withdrawal rate. Given this choice, the following recommendations 
                      and suggestions were made:</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>

                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Since 
                        social assistance recipients entering the experiment will 
                        no longer be forced to return as quickly as possible to 
                        paid work, there is a danger that they will also be cut 
                        off from resources (e.g. training, job counselling services, 
                        etc.) that are required to return to paid work. This may 
                        be ethically problematic. To solve this problem, it might 
                        be a good idea to give participants the same per capita 
                        value as the cost of these services in the form of a voucher, 
                        so that making use of these services remains on a voluntary 
                        basis, as it should be under a BI scheme.<br>
                        In the original proposal, besides social assistance recipients, 
                        workers with break-even incomes would be selected for 
                        the experiment. It is possible to narrow down this group 
                        even further in a sensible way, by allowing only families 
                        with young children in this group. The reason is that 
                        this group (being in the rush-hour of life) is the category 
                        most at risk, e.g. in terms of burn-out, insufficient 
                        time to care adequately for the children, etc.,and that 
                        for this group a large and significant labour supply response 
                        can be expected.<br>

                        a considerable extent, the Belgian lottery game Win for 
                        Life (W4L), which grants every winner an unconditional 
                        lifelong monthly payment of 1000 euro, represents a good 
                        proxy for what would happen after the introduction of 
                        a Basic Income. The many insights that can be obtained 
                        from the W4L for Basic Income research, as presented by 
                        Axel Marx and Hans Peeters at the workshop, rest on the 
                        following claim. If the winners do not stop working, or 
                        work less, or start up a business of their own after winning 
                        W4L, they will certainly not do so under a BI scheme. 
                        The reason is that the monthly payment for winners under 
                        the W4L scheme is, at least for the short and medium term, 
                        higher than any reasonable level of BI would be in the 
                        near future. Compared to a BI experiment, which is most 
                        likely a limited group of persons in a geographically 
                        narrowly defined area who receive a BI during only a limited 
                        time period, the W4L has several advantages. Based on 
                        the preliminary outcomes of the W4L, it is advisable to 
                        remove prospective entrepreneurs from the groups to be 
                        included in the experiment.<br>
                        We did not arrive at the stage of discussing practical 
                        matters like the number of questionnaires or the country 
                        most suitable to conduct a BI experiment. There was no 
                        consensus that launching a BI experiment would be a good 
                        idea after all. For one thing, the Win for Life lotteries 
                        will provide much of the information in the near future 
                        that a BI experiment would bring about. Besides some disadvantages, 
                        the W4L has two comparative advantages over a standard 
                        BI experiment. Firstly, a major shortcoming of a BI experiment 
                        is its limited duration. For instance, participants might 
                        not change their work pattern precisely because they know 
                        that the experiment will only last a limited number of 
                        years. In W4L, however, because the winners receive a 
                        lifelong benefit of 1000 euro per month, the behavioural 
                        responses will include the long term effect of receiving 
                        an unconditional benefit for the rest of one's life. Secondly, 
                        high income earners will not participate in a BI experiment 
                        if this would mean that, other things being equal, their 
                        net income would decrease (the BI received does not compensate 
                        the higher taxes payable). Therefore, the participants 
                        in the BI experiment will not be a representative sample 
                        of the population. In W4L, however, it should be possible 
                        to compose a group of winners which is more or less a 
                        representative sample of the population (except that there 
                        is a selection bias because they are all members of the 
                        group which buys lottery tickets).<br>

                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">During 
                        the ensuing discussion, two proposals were made to remedy 
                        shortcomings in the BI and W4L experiments. For the BI 
                        experiment, it was suggested that it should be possible 
                        to include the high income earners in the experiment by 
                        giving them a higher (lump sum) BI to compensate for their 
                        income loss because of the higher taxes to be paid. The 
                        result of this operation is that the income effect is 
                        set to zero, but the substitution effect is maintained. 
                        To avoid the selection bias of the W4L, it was suggested 
                        that we forfeit for once the automatic inflation adjustment 
                        of the tax allowance (in e.g. Belgium) in return for a 
                        lottery ticket for everyone. In this way, it is possible 
                        to get a group of winners which is both representative 
                        of the population as a whole and not affected by a selection 
                        bias.<br>

                        Alaska Permanent Fund is not financed by income taxation 
                        (but from oil revenues). In this sense, studying the W4L 
                        gives reliable information on the income effect of unconditional 
                        grants, but not on the substitution effects (due to higher 
                        tax rates required to finance the unconditional BI).<br>

                        Maynard stressed that the main rationale for random field 
                        experiments in the U.S. is the strong indication of the 
                        unreliability of the non-experimental evidence on many 
                        relevant topics of social policy. Although the high cost 
                        of an experiment, along with its ethics, may constitute 
                        an obstacle to launching an experiment, the cost of policy-making 
                        based on unreliable evidence and beliefs may be many times 
                        higher. To implement a policy without conducting a small- 
                        scale experiment beforehand amounts to putting the whole 
                        population into an experiment. For the design of the experiment, 
                        it is of paramount importance to know the important questions, 
                        to identify the main population groups to be included 
                        in the experiment and to know the critical features of 
                        the intervention which the experiment has to mimic. A 
                        practical point to keep in mind is that the effects of 
                        the experiment or intervention can change when the overall 
                        circumstances change. For instance, the effects of a BI 
                        in an economy with an unemployment rate of only 3% can 
                        be entirely different from the same economy with a 10% 
                        unemployment rate. If such a dramatic change were to occur 
                        during the experiment, a smart response would be to increase 
                        the sample size. In general, to correct for changes over 
                        time, there is much to be said for a staged entry into 
                        the experiment group. <br>

                        the U.S. NIT experiments, but the efficiency costs or 
                        losses of providing welfare (see Widerquist's paper below). 
                        To illustrate this point, and as is well known from public 
                        economics, efficiency costs arise from the tax rate, not 
                        from lump sum grants. <br>

                      very much enjoyed being part of the one-day workshop on 
                      a Basic Income experiment in Europe. About 20 of us spent 
                      the day discussing how Basic Income could be tested in a 
                      European social experiment. Toward the end of the workshop, 
                      it occurred to me that if there is going to be an experiment, 
                      we should start with a list of what we would like to learn 
                      from it. Well aware that we will actually be able to test 
                      for much less than we would like to know, I think that an 
                      extensive wish list is the best place to start. Then we 
                      can consider how we could test each of these questions and 
                      that will help to determine which ones we should actually 
                      focus on, and how best to set up the test. I started a list 
                      at the workshop, hoping to bring it up in the discussion 
                      at the end. But time ran short, and so I would like to circulate 
                      that list now, and ask everyone else who participated to 
                      contribute their thoughts.<br>

                      of the items on this list refer to the equation relating

                      whether the programme tests a Basic Income (BI) or a negative 
                      income tax (NIT). The equation is: after tax income (Yd) 
                      equals the Basic Income grant (G) plus private income (Y)

                      &#147;Efficiency loss&#148; is a technical term economists 
                      use to refer to a net loss to society as a whole. Most redistribution 
                      does not represent efficiency loss, because the loss to 
                      the taxpayer is a gain to the recipient. The question as 
                      to whether redistribution is desirable is an open one, but 
                      there is no efficiency loss unless some of the wealth that 
                      is being redistributed is lost along the way. Economists 
                      have many technical tools they use to estimate efficiency 
                      loss. Efficiency loss&#151;and not the tax cost&#151;is 
                      usually the &#147;bottom line&#148; question in any economic 
                      study, but it was largely ignored in the NIT experiments.

                      English utilitarian philosopher, Jeremy Bentham, called 
                      human rights &quot;nonsense on stilts&quot;. In fact he 
                      was amongst the most humane of men of early 19th century 
                      thinkers; but he did not regard the idea of rights, with 
                      its normal correlative of duties, as a helpful concept here.<br>
                      Many who share his doubts have been silent on the matter. 
                      If you want to outlaw torture or censorship or imprisonment 
                      without trial, it seems pedantic to quibble about whether 
                      these causes should be called human rights or not. The incorporation 
                      of the European Charter of Human Rights into British law 
                      was a great advance, whatever the label. A stand on human 
                      rights does tend to separate those who believe in humanity 
                      and due process from those who believe that the so-called 
                      ends justify the means.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">But 
                      when Basic Income is proclaimed as a right, I begin to see 
                      the point of Bentham's quibble. A rich and humane society 
                      can afford a minimum subsistence income for everyone without 
                      imposing conditions and obligations. If everyone has a basic 
                      sum on which he or she can fall back either in times of 
                      adversity or in order to withdraw partly or fully from the 
                      normal labour markets in order to engage in some less rewarded 
                      activity, whether altruistic, artistic or personal, a few 
                      of the beneficiaries may well choose to become Californian 
                      surfers. I would argue that he or she should be able to 
                      do so in a free society and that the cost of such dropping 
                      out to the rest of us is unlikely to be intolerable. But 
                      to say that the Californian surfer has a right to his activities 
                      is carrying the concept of right a bit too far.<br>

                      problem with Promoting Income Security is that so much of

                      to label a Basic Income as a right. The 34 essays in this 
                      book contain a mass of fascinating material into which anyone 
                      interested in Basic Income, whether in favour or against 
                      or agnostic, would do well to dip.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I 
                      was first drawn to Basic Income, which had not yet been 
                      christened with its name, several decades ago. This was 
                      because I was attracted by the libertarian aspect of capitalism, 
                      which enabled people to &quot;do their own thing&quot; and 
                      to choose their own occupations. But I was not so attracted 
                      by the continuation of the work-ethic aspects, which were 
                      important in its historical development on the lines explained 
                      by Max Weber and many others. I hoped we were approaching 
                      a time when these aspects could be dropped and we could 
                      instead give people a choice: they could opt in to the ordinary 
                      labour market with its rewards and hardships; they could 
                      opt out provided they were willing to live at a sustainable 
                      but modest standard of living; or they could compromise 
                      and take a poorly paid job, topped up by this universal 
                      payment to follow their own way of life whether as artists, 
                      lotus-eaters or whatever. This kind of compromise would 
                      have been impossible during most historical periods when 
                      a subsistence Basic Income would have been so near the normal 
                      wage that nobody would have found it worthwhile to work 
                      for pay. It is for this reason that the early 19th century 
                      Speenhamland attempts in this direction collapsed.<br>

                      object of a Basic Income is to make every citizen into a 
                      rentier in a small way. Private property and unearned income, 
                      so denounced by the Marxists, are not inherently evil. The 
                      trouble is that so few people have them (apart from their 
                      own homes), with all the benefits they provide of personal 
                      independence. Surely in the better society to which some 
                      of us aspire, these advantages should be more widespread.<br>

                      further reason for my interest was the development in the 
                      1970s and 80s of a much larger number of involuntary unemployed 
                      than had been the case in the post-war period. Not to beat 
                      about the bush, this reflected union-based and other labour 
                      market institutions which priced people out of jobs - something 
                      which New Labour admits but hides under a cloud of verbiage. 
                      I believed that reformers had to face up to the fact that 
                      the market clearing pay available to some workers might 
                      be below that required for any decent sort of existence.<br>

                      apparatus of such complexity that only a rocket scientist 
                      turned tax expert and welfare counsellor could have any 
                      hope of understanding it? Why not simplify the structure 
                      by offsetting at least some of these transactions by a single 
                      payment either from the citizen to the state or the other 
                      way round? Milton Friedman and some of his followers envisaged 
                      a negative income tax which would replace state welfare 
                      of all kinds, including benefits in kind such as health 
                      and education. Some others on the left envisaged a Basic 
                      Income paid in addition to every state service now provided 
                      and every payment already made.<br>

                      would be realistic at this stage to regard a Basic Income, 
                      whether paid across the counter or in the form of a negative 
                      income tax, as a substitute just for cash payments of all 
                      kinds, whether state pensions, unemployment benefits, sick 
                      pay or anything else. Even then there are problems enough. 
                      For something like the British Government's Social Fund 
                      would still be necessary for people so placed through health 
                      or circumstance that they could not manage on the Basic 
                      Income through no fault of their own.<br>

                      is a trade-off between Basic Income and the citizen stake, 
                      adopted in embryonic form under the British government's 
                      Trust Fund (&quot;baby bond&quot;) scheme for endowing each 
                      citizen with a modest capital sum, available when he or 
                      she gains adulthood. In some sense they are very similar, 
                      as the baby bond can be regarded as the discounted value 
                      of future Basic Income payments. From a libertarian point 
                      of view the bond is preferable as the holder is free to 
                      decide when to draw out the funds. On the other hand no 
                      civilised society would want someone who had misspent his 
                      initial endowment to starve in later life. So the bond could 
                      never be a complete substitute.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      its original form, linked with negative income tax, the 
                      Basic Income idea was often attacked from the left as a 
                      plot to get rid of the welfare state. But there was another 
                      argument which began to make some headway among the left. 
                      This was that despite its high costs the welfare state was 
                      not reaching some of those who needed it most. One reason 
                      was the conditionality of benefits, which deterred so many 
                      from applying and which made others ineligible. Indeed Basic 
                      Income has now become linked with all too many fashionable 
                      anti-capitalist causes such as anti-globalisation and extreme 
                      environmentalism or more simply and sadly with the &quot;lump 
                      of labour&quot; fallacy that asserts that there are not 
                      or will not be enough jobs to go round and so some other 
                      form of support is necessary.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Unfortunately 
                      this book leans, not completely but in tendency, towards 
                      such views. There is a real danger here. For advocacy in 
                      this form not only puts off the enlightened minority among 
                      anti-socialist politicians who might otherwise give it some 
                      house room. It also puts off consensus leaders such as Tony 
                      Blair or any likely successor, who would run a mile from 
                      anything they see as far-out sandal-wearing socialism.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">There 
                      is indeed an unfortunate tendency for Basic Income to be 
                      seen as a messianic movement for a select group rather than 
                      as a device for tackling a weakness in market capitalism. 
                      From the latter more pragmatic point of view the most interesting 
                      chapter in this book is by Karl Widerquist in which he discusses 
                      the four US experiments and the one Canadian one in local 
                      negative income tax that took place over the period 1968-80. 
                      Although 336 scholarly articles were written about them 
                      they did not prove decisive. &quot;Both Basic Income supporters 
                      and opponents could quote the findings of these experiments 
                      with equal conviction.&quot; The author's own opinion is 
                      that &quot;none of the facts were persuasive enough to cause 
                      either supporters or opponents to change their mind.&quot; 
                      The experiments indicated very tentatively &quot;that a 
                      Basic Income guarantee is financially feasible at the cost 
                      of certain side effects that people with differing political 
                      beliefs may take to be desirable or disastrous.&quot;<br>

                      the way ahead is to look at each country's existing social 
                      security system, examine how nearly it approaches a Basic 
                      Income, and see how the gap can be narrowed and eventually 
                      closed. In the UK one element of such a system already exists 
                      in the state pension. Another element consists of child 
                      benefits unconditionally available to all.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      present Labour government, building on the unsung efforts 
                      of its predecessors, has tried to remove the work disincentive 
                      effect of the ordinary dole by a system of in-work benefits. 
                      In addition child benefits are now topped up by child tax 
                      credits related to family income.<br>
                      The most promising advance at present relates to state pensions. 
                      The complications of the pension credits, and their incomplete 
                      take-up, are creating a consensus in favour of a straightforward 
                      increase in pensions indexed to earnings, which would in 
                      effect create a Basic Income for those of pension age.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      most difficult task is to persuade governments to loosen 
                      the conditions applying to in-work benefits. Professor Tony 
                      Atkinson, who writes in this volume, has previously suggested 
                      a Citizen's Participation Income in which the definition 
                      of work would be widened to include full-time education 
                      and training, intensive care work and approved voluntary 
                      activities. This could be a halfway house towards removing 
                      the in-work condition. The most difficult part will be to 
                      remove the taper by which benefits are withdrawn at a surtax 
                      rate as earnings from work increase. But if only we could 
                      bite this bullet the whole case for capitalism and market 
                      forces would be easier both to make and to believe: not 
                      a consideration which will weigh too heavily among some 
                      of the contributors to this book. </font><br>

                      his introduction, Nicholas Timmins suggests that there is 
                      now a consensus across the political spectrum: that poverty 
                      and social disadvantage need to be tackled; and he recognises 
                      that there is a limit to what current (means-testing) policies 
                      can achieve. He writes: <br>
                      &quot;Labour, having been in the past an arch-opponent of 
                      means testing, has in practice achieved much of its redistribution 
                      in office by using it. There has been a genuine attempt 
                      to tackle the complications and stigma of claiming means-tested 
                      benefits, not least through the creation and language of 
                      tax credits. Yet the critics, some of whose voices can be 
                      heard in these essays, are unconvinced, insisting that the 
                      price has been unacceptable complexity. And in the case 
                      of pensions, there are certainly strong arguments that the 
                      Pension Credit, while a clear gain for today's poorer pensioners, 
                      has made decisions about saving far harder for today's lower 
                      income workers. Add to that the recent falls in stock-markets, 
                      greater longevity and the underfunding of pension schemes 
                      and there is a feeling that Britain's pension system is 
                      at a crossroads. Travelling further down the means-tested 
                      road is likely to lead to greater compulsion to save. The 
                      alternative route would be for the basic state pension to 
                      be rebuilt and turned into something closer to a participation, 
                      or even a 'citizenship', pension&quot; (pp.18f).<br>

                      the institute for Public Policy Research, Sue Regan and 
                      Peter Robinson suggest that simply increasing the levels 
                      of tax credits and of the minimum wage is not enough, that 
                      &quot;a positive conceptualisation of rights and responsibilities 
                      is needed to replace the muddy waters left by the demise 
                      of the contributory principle&quot; (p.31), that simplification 
                      of the benefits system is essential (p.32), and that means-testing 
                      must be reduced (p.33). <br>

                      Wicks, of the Social Market Foundation, shows that both 
                      means testing (in the form of tax credits) and universal 
                      provision (Child Benefit) have increased in value for poorer 
                      families, with the result that income has been redistributed 
                      and that the National Insurance system has suffered. He 
                      recognises that the Labour government has reduced the stigma 
                      related to means-tested benefits by making 80% of families 
                      eligible for them in the form of tax credits; but he also 
                      recognises the disincentive effect of benefits being withdrawn 
                      at the same time as tax and National Insurance contributions 
                      are paid. A housing tax credit is suggested - and the problem 
                      of its complexity is recognised. A universal (rather than 
                      means-tested) asset-based welfare system is recommended 
                      (p.55).<br>

                      to the structure of tax and benefits the attention which 
                      it deserves, partly no doubt because neither the Scottish 
                      Parliament nor the Welsh Assembly have any control over 
                      these matters. It would be interesting to see what would 
                      happen if they were given these powers. Would we see a variety 
                      of different approaches in different parts of the UK ? And 
                      would we therefore be more able to study the pros and cons 
                      of different systems and be better able to improve the system 
                      in all parts of the UK ?<br>

                      approach to the study of social exclusion which gives this 
                      book its distinctive character: an approach which concentrates 
                      on particular events of exclusion (rather than on personal 
                      and family biography), on people's reactions to events, 
                      and on the principles of legitimation employed in relation 
                      to welfare state resources: 'earning' them, being a 'member',

                      to the chapter on 'subsistence'); but the authors have gathered 
                      sufficient evidence to enable them to draw some robust conclusions,

                        its character as resource becomes precarious. Its solidarity
