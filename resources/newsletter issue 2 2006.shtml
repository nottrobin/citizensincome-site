                      Great Britain (April 2006) discusses definitions of poverty 
                      and different ways of measuring it and then in relation 
                      to these discusses the depth and persistence of income poverty, 
                      the groups most likely to be poor, and European comparisons. 
                      On the basis of the evidence CPAG then offers 'ten steps

                      calls for an increase in the value of benefits for children.

                      functioning mechanism that does not suffer the administrative

                      vital role in tackling child poverty. The element that is 
                      child benefit ought to be maximised and provides a key way 
                      to build a national consensus towards increasing the value

                      May 2006) are proposals to link the Basic State Pension 
                      to earnings from 2012, to cut the number of years to qualify 
                      to thirty, to reform credits for carers, and to ensure that 
                      more women and new retirees receive the Basic State Pension. 
                      Over time these proposals, if enacted, and if plans for 
                      personal savings accounts have the hoped-for effects, then 
                      large numbers of people over a rising pensionable age should 
                      be removed from means-testing and the Basic State Pension

                      Joseph Rowntree Foundation </b>has reported on a research 
                      project on child poverty in large families. The researchers 
                      found that 'the best outcome in terms of equity for large 
                      families is achieved by increasing Child Benefit to the 
                      same level per child and then increasing the benefit for 
                      the third and subsequent child by &pound;20 per week. However, 
                      it would cost &pound;3.39 billion. Lesser increases in Child 
                      Benefit for larger families achieve more modest reductions 
                      in the poverty rates but at lower costs.' The Foundaton 
                      recognizes that 'there are choices to be made between universal 
                      and selective policy measures. Improvements in Child Benefit 
                      for large families are expensive because they go to every 
                      large family whatever their income. Increasing Child Tax 
                      Credit for large families may concentrate extra help on 
                      those who need it most. However, Child Tax Credit suffers 
                      from non-take-up and such measures will also increase the 
                      poverty trap (high marginal tax rates as earnings rise).'

                      to advice centres and MPs' surgeries suggesting the Revenue 
                      was struggling to cope. Although the Treasury welcomed a

                      the figures also showed that overpayments in 2003-04 were

                      say the fundamental problem is one of design rather than 
                      implementation. The child tax credit and working tax credit 
                      introduced in 2003 were conceived by the Treasury to rise 
                      and fall according to income, either month-by-month if claimants 
                      kept the Revenue informed of each change of circumstance, 
                      or at the end of the tax year. The Treasury argues that 
                      a flexible system is better able to help those whose incomes 
                      deteriorate during the year. But from the outset experts 
                      warned that it would impose a big administrative burden 
                      on the Revenue, with potentially large corrections to awards.<br>

                      but added that the government would keep it &quot;under

                      year of big overpayments, since the Revenue should be using 
                      more reliable income estimates than in 2003 and claimants 
                      should be more familiar with the system, he said.'<br>

                      should the state incorporate women into its policies? Should 
                      it recognise them as being different from men? Or should 
                      it treat them the same as men? This is Wollstonecraft's 
                      Dilemma. The male breadwinner welfare state encourages gender 
                      differences whereas the adult worker model adopts a gender-neutral 
                      approach. Relying on women's position in either the family 
                      or in the workforce as a conduit for promoting female welfare 
                      has had mixed results. Could a Citizen's Income (CI) improve 
                      on this? Commentators are divided. This paper presents these 
                      critiques in an attempt to ascertain the potential of a 
                      CI to resolve Wollstonecraft's Dilemma. It accepts that 
                      welfare models are designed to secure more than the right 
                      to work in the home or labour market. Accordingly, it considers 
                      the impact of a CI on each of the six normative reasons 
                      for providing welfare - to promote autonomy, social equality, 
                      social integration, social stability, and economic efficiency, 
                      as well as to prevent poverty - focusing on how this interplay 
                      might affect women's welfare in particular. <br>

                      accounts of the role different social groups played in paving 
                      the way for the emergence of modern welfare states were 
                      slow to acknowledge women's contribution (see Bock and Thane 
                      1991). Irrespective of this late start, a substantial body 
                      of work now exists documenting how women were instrumental 
                      in bringing about its existence. Despite their activism, 
                      when the battle to make the welfare state a reality was 
                      won women became the indirect recipients of its largesse 
                      while men were the primary beneficiaries. This was neither 
                      an accident nor a conspiracy. Instead, it stemmed from the 
                      division in opinion over women's position in society, with 
                      the split not neatly divided along gendered lines. That 
                      is, just as men lacked consensus on many aspects of the 
                      welfare state's nature, women too did not hold common views. 
                      On no other issue was this more evident than in how they 
                      wanted to be recognised by the state - as workers or as 
                      mothers, in other words the same as or different from men. 
                      A predicament Carol Pateman subsequently coined as Wollstonecraft's 
                      Dilemma (1992). For a host of reasons, it was the supporters 
                      of the latter stance who were victorious. Accordingly, welfare 
                      institutions came to view women to be primarily wives and 
                      mothers engaged in domestic duties and in contrast to men, 
                      who assumed the role of financial provider for their family.

                      Scandinavian countries, in general, moved first and furthest 
                      away from this male breadwinner (MB) arrangement towards 
                      an adult worker (AW) model. In this approach to welfare 
                      delivery, both women and men are expected to participate 
                      in the labour market, and the institutional framework is 
                      structured to achieve this end. For instance, universal 
                      state-subsided child and eldercare services remove the obligation 
                      to care from the individual, while a large public sector 
                      provides employment opportunities, and, at the same time, 
                      tax individualisation increases the cost for a spouse to 
                      abstain from paid work. Hence, the dogma of differences 
                      in gender roles was replaced by one of sameness. Scandinavian 
                      welfare states are often considered to be the most female 
                      friendly regime, in part because of their own successes 
                      in improving women's social standing, but also as an outcome 
                      from the plethora of research that has since exposed the 
                      inadequacies of the MB system for women. That is, these 
                      studies have uncovered the hidden poverty of women in households 
                      where income is withheld from the family by the wage-earner 
                      (Daly 1992) and highlighted how a lack of access to resources 
                      keeps them trapped in abusive relationships (Charles 2000). 
                      They also found the gender division of labour ideology to 
                      limit the earning potential, career progression, and political 
                      advancement of those women who participated in paid work 
                      instead of or along with motherhood (Daly and Rake 2003). 
                      Furthermore, they show caring to be less valued than employment, 
                      in terms of either money or respect (Lister 2003), to name 
                      but a few of the adverse effects of the MB arrangement. 
                      Indeed, such are the achievements of the AW model, and compounded 
                      with changes in family compositions and labour market structures, 
                      that increasing the numbers of women in the workforce has 
                      become a priority of European social policy. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Nonetheless, 
                      caution is required before breathing a sigh of relief that 
                      applying an emphasis on female employment in the policies 
                      of member states will correct the unequal position of women 
                      across the EU. A large part of the Scandinavian success 
                      rests on the state's role as an employer and deliverer of 
                      services, in that it can ensure that standards are met - 
                      well-paid, flexible, permanent jobs as well as available, 
                      affordable, quality care provision. Many countries oppose 
                      this degree of state involvement, believing instead that 
                      the market or the family are more appropriate providers 
                      of these functions. When this position and the AW ideology 
                      are combined - the United States being the classic example 
                      - the risk of poverty for women, on average, intensifies. 
                      Expected to be both employee and carer pushes large numbers 
                      of them into part-time jobs, which are typically low-paid 
                      and insecure. In addition, although women in the Scandinavian 
                      AW system score higher on wellbeing indicators - representation 
                      in key areas of political and economic life, share of earned 
                      income, and level of employment - than women in other welfare 
                      state types, their ratings nevertheless remain lower than 
                      those of Scandinavian men (Human Development Index). Furthermore, 
                      research has shown that paid work, no matter how useless 
                      the enterprise, continues to be held in higher regard than 
                      unpaid care labour, however useful (Leira 2000). <br>

                      limitations with the role specialisation (i.e. women different 
                      to men) MB arrangement and the gender-neutral (i.e. women 
                      the same as men) AW model are, for some commentators, grounds 
                      for implementing a Citizen's Income (CI) - a regular, unconditional, 
                      flat payment, sufficient to cover basic needs, paid directly 
                      to each citizen, in place of current social security transfers 
                      and tax relief. As will be detailed below, not everyone 
                      is convinced of a CI's potential to safeguard women's welfare. 
                      Regardless of whether a CI would afford women the opportunity 
                      to be either an employee or carer, autonomy is just one 
                      goal of welfare states, which according to Robert Goodin 
                      (1988) has six commonly cited functions. Namely, promoting 
                      autonomy, social equality, social integration, social stability, 
                      and economic efficiency, as well as preventing poverty. 
                      Much has been written on the likely consequences of a CI, 
                      with many discussions addressing its impact on one or more 
                      of these objectives. This paper draws together these observations, 
                      presenting in the following six sections the critiques of 
                      CI's expected influence on each of the welfare state's priorities. 
                      More specifically, it focuses on the possible affect this

                      they are not autonomous but are instead dependent on those 
                      who control their access to resources, and this dependency 
                      makes them susceptible to exploitation (Goodin 1988: 21).

                        for negotiating a paid and unpaid work role - that no 
                        one could be coerced into a job or a domestic responsibility 
                        out of dependence on another for his or her basic resources 
                        (Jordan 1987: 160). <br>
                        Women could choose to be primary caregivers while retaining 
                        financial independence and the protection this entails. 
                        Indeed, the benefit of a cash transfer free of a work-test 
                        would not be confined to women. All wage-labourers would 
                        be empowered to exit the labour market completely or to 
                        reduce the time they spend participating in it, according 
                        to their preference (Ackerman and Alstott 1999: 211). 
                        But, some argued that, because it is paid irrespective 
                        of a willingness to work, a CI would substitute one form 
                        of exploitation with another - it is 'a recipe for exploitation 
                        of the industrious by the lazy' (Elster 1987: 719). In 
                        response, it is proposed that the concept of work be broadened 
                        to include more than just wage labour, given that the 
                        majority of the voluntary unemployed are active in socially 
                        useful tasks (McKay 2001: 104-109) and that a small minority 
                        of 'free-riders' will exist with or without eligibility 
                        rules (Van Parijs 2000). <br>

                      a CI could be used to purchase services by women who want 
                      to move from caring into paid employment, thus liberating 
                      them to follow their ambitions (Walter 1989: 120). Elizabeth 
                      Anderson (2000) is unconvinced. Its flat-rate payments, 
                      she notes, fails to acknowledge that citizens with a disability 
                      and/or caring responsibilities require more assets to achieve 
                      the equivalent level of freedom enjoyed by those who have 
                      neither a disability nor dependents. Although children will 
                      be entitled to a CI, this observation does highlight the 
                      importance of the CI child-rate being sufficient to cover 
                      caring costs if mothers are to given a 'real choice between 
                      work inside or outside their home' (Robeyns 2000: 131). 
                      In addition, while purchasing power will improve with a 
                      CI there is no guarantee that the supply of services will 
                      meet the demand. Jane Lewis, (2004) warns that the 'neglect 
                      of service provision is likely to constrain women's choices' 
                      (p. 10). However, Tony Walters (1989) believes that the 
                      private market will respond adequately but Ingrid Robeyns 
                      (2000) recommends a complementary set of public childcare 
                      initiatives. Nevertheless, caring does not inevitably have 
                      to shift to either the market or the state. A CI would give 
                      full-time employees the opportunity to buy job-free time, 
                      thus creating a pool of potential (mostly male) carers within 
                      families and the community, and in turn, improving the current 
                      gender imbalance in caring. <br>

                      CI offers all citizens a choice in how they spend their

                      threat of destitution and/or exploitation. Moreover, in 
                      placing this choice with individuals, Wollstonecraft's Dilemma 
                      becomes obsolete - women will be incorporated into the state 
                      on the basis of their citizenship alone; thereafter their 
                      role will be a private decision rather than a public issue.<br>

                      some an overriding benefit from a CI is that it offers recognition 
                      for care labour and to those who provide it. The introduction 
                      of this universal unconditional payment, Carol Pateman (2003) 
                      explains, would 'change women's standing as citizens since 
                      employment would be dethroned from its position as the only 
                      work that really counts' (p. 141). Others are less enthused. 
                      Caring, they claim, is not especially valued by a CI, since 
                      it is paid to all regardless of whether the recipient is 
                      caring or not (Lister 2003: 189). Nonetheless, an alternative 
                      caregiver allowance while specifically rewarding informal 
                      work is, as parental leave schemes internationally show, 
                      more likely to be claimed by females in heterosexual couples. 
                      A major contributory factor for this higher female take-up 
                      rate is that these allowances are not usually indexed to 
                      earnings - it costs more for men to abstain from paid work, 
                      because of their greater earning potential. Hence, caregiver 
                      allowances 'reinforces the view of such work as women's 
                      work and consolidates the gender division of domestic labour' 
                      (Fraser 1997: 58). Whereas a CI payment, albeit set at a 
                      flat-rate, is paid to each member of the family, and would 
                      cushion a drop in the total household income, thus allowing 
                      the main breadwinners (mostly male) to reduce their employment 
                      hours. The opportunity for men to spend more time caring 
                      and for women to pursue their career will be greater than 
                      is currently the case. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      optimistic assessment is questioned by Judith Carlson (1997) 
                      who concurs that a CI would allow shorter employment hours 
                      for men, but reasons that there is no guarantee that they 
                      will in turn use this job-free time to contribute to the 
                      unpaid labour in the household and community (p.8). And 
                      so, caring would be no less feminised under a CI than with 
                      a caregiver's allowance. In a similar vein, it is suggested 
                      that the option a CI offers to refuse employment is likely 
                      to be embraced more by women than men (Fitzpatrick 1999: 
                      167). Ingrid Robeyns' (2000) warns against the negative 
                      consequences a weakening of women's attachment to the labour 
                      market would have for those women who retain a commitment 
                      to employment. Individual women, she concludes, will find 
                      it difficult to get hired, trained, or promoted because 
                      employers will be conscious of their propensity to withdraw 
                      from the workforce (p. 132). There is then the possibility 
                      that this would exacerbate the present gender imbalance 
                      in positions of authority, to the detriment of all women 
                      - advocates of women being more like men consider female 
                      participation in the public sphere to be instrumental in 
                      getting and keeping their concerns on the agenda. These 
                      arguments run counter to the emerging 'men-studies' literature, 
                      which suggest that men's work-centred behaviour is the result 
                      of the current work environment culture, fiscal considerations, 
                      social policies etc, as opposed to reflecting their preference 
                      (see Burgess and Graeme 2003). <br>
                      Paying a CI irrespective of being in the workforce or outside 
                      of it will not in itself be enough to promote social equality. 
                      For this, it is vital that both women and men embrace its 
                      potential for adopting a work-care mix. While a CI does 
                      not address the female bias in care labour directly, it 
                      does strengthen the bargaining hand of men to care more 
                      and work less, and for women to do the contrary. In meeting 
                      this condition, the conundrum of how the state should incorporate 
                      women into its policies will be resolved. That is, it will 
                      no longer be necessary to conceptualise women according 
                      to how their work patterns deviate from or replicate those 
                      of men's when combining career and caring becomes the norm 
                      for all.<br>

                      Atkinson (1995) notes that one of the reasons why a CI 'enjoys 
                      support from a wide constituency' is that it is viewed as 
                      a means of preventing social exclusion (p.75). For example, 
                      an independent income for women is shown to be an effective 
                      measure in alleviating child poverty, because mothers spend 
                      a greater proportion of their income on their children, 
                      relative to fathers (Pahl 1989: 171). Tackling child poverty 
                      reduces the risk of children partaking in the types of behaviour 
                      - low education attainment, crime, early parenthood, etc 
                      that contributes to exclusion continuing into adulthood 
                      (Kiernan 2002: 96). Furthermore, a CI would provide the 
                      'material basis for effective political participation'. 
                      Guaranteed an income, citizens would have the time to be 
                      politically active - 'from running for candidate, over working 
                      in party offices to canvassing the streets on behalf of 
                      political candidates' (Dowding, De Wispelaere and White 
                      2003: 16). The same would be true for greater involvement 
                      in family and community activities, so increasing social 
                      interaction. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Yet, 
                      a significant weakness with a CI as an instrument for promoting 
                      social inclusion is that 'benefits based on citizenship 
                      can provide the basis for exclusion of non-citizens' and 
                      that such policies 'have been recognized as being ill-equipped 
                      to deal with an age of large-scale and heterogeneous migratory 
                      movements' (Kofman et al 2000: 144 and 77). The over-representation 
                      of women entering countries through family reunions, a proviso 
                      of which in many states is no recourse to public funds, 
                      makes this shortcoming more pertinent for women. In addition 
                      to issues surrounding entitlement, it is argued that 'simply 
                      being given cash does not by itself make someone part of 
                      mainstream society' (Hill 2002: 227). A CI provides the 
                      means but it will be each citizen's responsibility to grasp 
                      the opportunity their payment affords them to be socially 
                      active. <br>

                      for Social Justice 1994). Others regard changing work patterns, 
                      e.g. female employment, as contributing to the demise of 
                      social networks (see Putnam 2000). A CI offers a solution 
                      complimentary to these diverging opinions. It allows for 
                      greater numbers to participate in paid work and to reduce 
                      the time they spend therein. Moreover, both women and men 
                      will be in a position to partake in public and private, 
                      local and national, social and economic social activities. 
                      No realm will be the preserve of a particular sex, as has 
                      previously been the case.<br>

                      are considered to be an essential component for the successful 
                      functioning of society (Davidoff et al, 1999: 20-21). The 
                      household neutrality feature of a CI - it is paid to individuals 
                      irrespective of their living arrangement - is regarded by 
                      some to be family friendly (Fitzpatrick 1999: 86). That 
                      is, unlike current welfare payments in many countries, the 
                      CI would not cease should a lone mother cohabit with a man. 
                      While this could assist two-adult families to form, it simultaneously 
                      could prevent others from splitting. A CI paid at a flat-rate, 
                      rather than proportionate to total household income, could 
                      make it economically unfeasible for those in unsatisfactory

                      nevertheless questionable as to how stable a society would 
                      be if sectors of the community feel that their living arrangements 
                      are being forced upon them. On the contrary, Patricia Morgan

                      from the desire to safeguard family units as a means of 
                      maintaining social stability in the present, encouraging 
                      women to have more children, as a way of ensuring societies 
                      will continue in to the future, is a goal of many nations. 
                      Since the mid 1980s, fertility has fallen below generation 
                      replacement rates in the majority of industrialised countries 
                      (Sleebos 2003: 13). A CI could help improve fertility rates 
                      in a number of ways. Firstly, it offers young adults who 
                      are unemployed, underemployed or low-paid the financial 
                      support Gosta Esping-Andersen (1999) identifies as crucial 
                      for enabling them to establish independent households sooner, 
                      so that they can have longer childbearing years together 
                      (69-70). Secondly, because a CI does not discriminate on 
                      age - it would be paid from birth, the cost of children 
                      would be lower. Thirdly, the reduction in the reliance on 
                      waged work increases men's opportunity to contribute more 
                      time to household tasks which research shows to increase 
                      the odds of a second birth (Prince-Cooke 2005: 24). Ultimately, 
                      a CI's potential to raise fertility is endorsed by the analysis 
                      undertaken by Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian (2003), on behalf 
                      of the IMF. They conclude that this effect is one reason 
                      why a CI is unsuitable for developing countries concerned 
                      with reducing birth rates. If so, then it might equally 
                      reconcile the birth deficit in Western nations. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">While 
                      a CI appears to be an amenable policy for encouraging fertility 
                      it remains uncertain what effect its household neutral feature 
                      will have on the two-adult family - expanding the numbers 
                      or adding to its demise. It is worth noting that families 
                      do not have to be of the traditional variety for society 
                      to reap the benefits. Indeed, the nuclear family is believed 
                      by some to be detrimental to female wellbeing (see Barrett 
                      and McIntosh 1982). With a CI, groups of individuals could 
                      form families and enjoy the benefits of economies of scales 
                      without anyone having to surrender their statutory payments, 
                      as is currently the case in many states when a member of 
                      the household is deemed to be earning sufficient funds to 
                      support non-earning members.<br>

                      healthy economy is widely held to be a prerequisite for 
                      advancing human welfare. As such, it is imperative that 
                      the economy is supported in ways that enable it to operate 
                      efficiently. The concern of a high volume of the CI literature 
                      is with its expected influence on productivity. For some, 
                      Claus Offe (1992) observes, the preoccupation is with the 
                      'work-shyness' they fear an unconditional CI will encourage 
                      (p. 75). In contrast, others insist that a preference for 
                      employment would continue, because a CI, while being sufficient 
                      for subsistence, would be moderate (Janson 2000: 10). Also, 
                      since it would not be withdrawn from those who accept a 
                      job, barriers such as poverty and employment traps would 
                      be removed. It is further proposed that, in providing for 
                      basic needs a CI 'has a direct wage subsidizing effect'. 
                      Employers could create more jobs since work currently left 
                      undone because it costs more to do than it is worth would 
                      become viable (van der Veen 2003: 168). In addition, individuals 
                      might use the income security to establish their own business 
                      venture or as an opportunity to acquire new skills (van 
                      der Veen 2003: 168). Thus, workers could move from work 
                      to education and back to work many times during their working 
                      life - a vital requirement in today's knowledge-based economy 
                      (Van Parijs 2002: 357). <br>

                      it is argued that the CI will not have a negative effect 
                      on the economy overall, it is conceded that women with dependents 
                      will be particularly susceptible should a corresponding 
                      flat-rate tax be implemented, as is popularly recommended, 
                      to fund a CI (Clark 2002: 20). Currently, the earnings of 
                      many part-time workers, the majority of whom are women in 
                      all European countries, are exempt from tax and social security 
                      contributions. If all additional income is taxable at a 
                      uniform rate this could possibly lead to them exiting the 
                      labour market completely, or conspiring with employers in 
                      not declaring their earnings to the tax authorities. In 
                      the latter situation, the revenue pool for funding a CI 
                      would be smaller and so the tax-rate would be higher than 
                      necessary. Moreover, women would be unprotected by employment 
                      legislation in the black economy and a worsening of their 
                      employment conditions is highly probable. Nonetheless, Tony 
                      Walter (1989) believes that the inclusion of women into 
                      the tax system is an important component in advancing gender 
                      equality in the workplace (p. 122). In the former scenario, 
                      this would cause a decline in the size of the workforce, 
                      and would subsequently inflate the price of wages. Yet, 
                      it is reasoned that even if the fall in the female labour 
                      supply were significant this would not damage economic efficiency, 
                      as the majority would inevitably move into the social economy.

                      making caring and participation in the social sphere affordable, 
                      society as a whole would benefit and economic efficiency 
                      would not be constrained by a CI. But if, as a consequence 
                      of the funding mechanism, paid work becomes an unattractive 
                      option for women this could reinforce the sexual division 
                      of labour - women over-represented in the social economy 
                      and men in the market economy. Women would be different

                      Dilemma this, as mentioned above, will not necessarily be

                      the 1970s, feminist researchers began to investigate the

                      and Millar (1987) found that 'poverty is not gender-neutral. 
                      Whether they are young or old, living with or without men, 
                      caring for children or other dependants, women are more 
                      likely than men to be poor' (p. 3). <br>

                      Parker (1993) contends that a CI 'could be reasonably expected 
                      to redistribute income from men to women' (p. 63). For example, 
                      a CI paid directly to spouses, rather than as an adult-dependent 
                      benefit payment or tax credit, would 'transform the dependent 
                      wife into a woman of independent means' (Walter 1989: 117), 
                      which in turn reduces the risk of poverty within families 
                      for women working fulltime in the home. Nevertheless, if 
                      the obstacles to female employment are not addressed (the 
                      imbalance in domestic and care labour) men could receive 
                      their CI while continuing to engage in paid employment. 
                      As Judith Carlson (1997) points out 'the [CI] could become 
                      a minimum income for men (a floor on which they can build) 
                      and a maximum income for women (a ceiling above which they 
                      find it extremely difficult to rise)' (p. 9).<br>

                      even if all women were to become like men - i.e. workers 
                      - employment is no longer as effective in combating poverty 
                      as it once was. Full-time, life-long employment and the 
                      income security it entails is on the decline while part-time 
                      stop-gap jobs and precarious earnings are becoming more 
                      common (McKay 2001: 101). As such, the working poor population 
                      is big and growing - those whose earnings are inadequate 
                      to meet their needs (Standing 1992: 52). It is suggested 
                      that a CI would benefit the unemployed, underemployed and 
                      low-paid (Van Parijs 1996: 65), in acting as a safety net 
                      during unemployment spells and supplementing the earnings 
                      of part-time and low-paid workers (see Widerquist and Lewis 
                      2006). This would be particularly valuable to women since 
                      they are the majority of part-time employees and tend to 
                      be concentrated in jobs that are synonymous with low pay 
                      (McKay 2001: 102). This optimism is contested. Firstly, 
                      employers could use a CI as justification for cutting wages 
                      - the basic needs of the workforce would be provided for 
                      through their CI, therefore employers would no longer have 
                      to provide a living wage (Clark 2002: 20). Although, if 
                      this proved to be the case then minimum wage legislation 
                      could be enforced alongside a CI. Secondly, because of its 
                      unconditional nature 'even Bill Gates would receive his 
                      monthly [CI] cheque'. However, the ending of tax relief 
                      would ensure that Bill Gates and his ilk would also pay 
                      more taxes than they currently do (Block 2000: 1). <br>

                      a CI to individuals, as a means of tackling poverty, would 
                      provide all citizens with direct access to the resources 
                      to meet their basic needs whatever their connection to the 
                      labour market. Nonetheless, in western societies the concern 
                      is less with absolute poverty - providing the essentials 
                      for survival - and more on relative poverty - closing the 
                      income gap between individuals and groups. How effective 
                      a CI will be in closing the gender earnings gap will depend 
                      on the extent to which the payments are used by men to undertake 
                      more caring work and by women to participate more in paid 
                      labour. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Both 
                      the MB and AW models take masculine work patterns (continuous 
                      full-time employment) as their reference point. In the MB 
                      arrangement women are viewed as different from men - carers 
                      as opposed to workers, while in the AW welfare state women 
                      are encouraged to behave the same as men - workers. Fewer 
                      women than men fit exclusively into either category, and 
                      less so over time. Rather, large numbers combine the breadwinner 
                      and caregiver roles. A CI extends the opportunity to make 
                      this work-care mix the norm for men as well as women. Should 
                      this opportunity be seized, Wollstonecraft's dilemma of 
                      how the state should incorporate women into its policies 
                      would be resolved. That is, no longer will it have to integrate 
                      women according to how their behaviour relates to that of 
                      men, since men will now be in a position to behave the same 
                      as women. Moreover, in achieving this fusion of gender roles 
                      into one worker-carer category, women's overall wellbeing, 
                      as measured against Goodins six welfare functions, need 
                      not be compromised. <br>

                      theme of incentives to work is the focus of Part I. Bridgen 
                      and Thomas put forward a matching model of the labour market 
                      that distinguishes between high effort job searchers (which 
                      are 'unemployed' when they do not have a job) and low effort 
                      job searchers (which are simply 'inactive' when non-employed). 
                      Each group of individuals is then modeled as having different 
                      but interdependent wage rates (resulting from the assumption 
                      that firms can identify and discriminate between the two 
                      types of agents). Some interesting conclusions are derived 
                      from this model, namely on the significant relevance of 
                      unemployment and inactivity benefits. These results may 
                      have important implications for basic income proposals, 
                      as a substantial increase in benefits available to low effort 
                      job searchers (not covered by unemployment benefits but 
                      which would obviously be covered by a universal basic income) 
                      could have a very significant impact on their labour market 
                      participation, with the consequent macroeconomic impact.

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Also 
                      interesting is the assessment of the effects of taxation 
                      on work activity, industry mix and shadow economy activities 
                      carried out by Davis and Henrekson. They find a strong and 
                      persistent relation between higher tax rates (on consumption 
                      and labour income) and a smaller proportion of time dedicated 
                      to market activities. They also find that higher taxes are 
                      associated with larger shadow economies and smaller value 
                      added and employment shares of low wage industries. The 
                      general direction of the results is unsurprising since it 
                      would be expected from economic theory that higher tax rates 
                      negatively impact on participation rates and low wage industries 
                      and provide an incentive to the growth of the underground 
                      economy, but the magnitude of some effects is noteworthy 
                      (e.g. 'a unit standard deviation tax hike of 12.8 percentage 
                      points leads to (&#133;) a 4.9 percentage point drop in 
                      the employment-population ratio' [p. 89]). Although those 
                      relations would possibly be harder to measure it would be 
                      interesting to study the effects of higher capital taxes 
                      on the same output variables. By reducing the expected after-tax 
                      returns on investment, higher rates on capital tend to discourage 
                      capital accumulation and, consequently, reduce the demand 
                      for labour. Most importantly for patterns of labour market 
                      participation, higher taxes on capital may slow down the 
                      creation of higher-paying and more attractive jobs. This 
                      issue is also central for active labour market policies 
                      (ALMPs), such as the Italian tax credit analysed in Chapter 
                      6. Unless such measures are financed by a reduction of public 
                      expenditure in other areas they will require higher taxation 
                      in other sectors. Consequently, even if ALMPs are considered 
                      effective means of increasing labour participation (as Cipollone 
                      et al argue in the Italian tax credits case study), their 
                      overall impact also includes the (supposedly negative) effects 
                      on the sectors where the costs are imposed. What is seen 
                      (the increase in participation of eligible individuals) 
                      must be balanced with that which is not seen (the negative 
                      effects on the sectors which are subjected to increased 
                      taxation).<br>

                      second part of the book (where the aforementioned Chapter 
                      6 is included) deals with several specific factors affecting 
                      labour market participation. Two chapters are devoted to 
                      the evolution and determinants of labour supply by women 
                      while Chapter 5 (Genre et al) analyses labour market participation 
                      by employing a wide range of economic and institutional 
                      factors as variables at country-level. Of particular interest 
                      may be the finding that labour market rigidity negatively 
                      affects the participation rate of most groups with the significant 
                      exception of men aged 25 to 54, who supposedly have the 
                      greatest power in shaping those rigid institutions.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      expansion of part-time, temporary and other alternative 
                      forms of employment has been a response to changing economic, 
                      social and technological conditions in Europe since the 
                      mid-1970s, as well as a way to circumvent rigid regulation 
                      of permanent contracts. The two articles in the third part 
                      of the book deal with these new forms of employment relationships, 
                      focusing specifically on the advantages and risks of part-time 
                      and fixed-term contracts.<br>
                      One important question that remains unaddressed is that 
                      of arguing why the labour participation objectives set in 
                      the Lisbon Agenda are worthy goals in the first place. Why 
                      is it necessarily 'progress' to converge to a 70 per cent 
                      employment rate (60 percent for women and 50 percent for 
                      older workers)? There are of course obvious financial reasons 
                      related to the sustainability of social security systems 
                      and economic reasons related to growth, but the question 
                      is a relevant one if we consider that increasing participation 
                      rates are not the only potential solution to these problems. 
                      Since leisure is presumably valued positively by individuals 
                      and non-market activities can also be 'productive' in a 
                      broader sense, it would be advisable to have some in-depth 
                      discussion of the defensibility of the participation rate 
                      goals that underlie most of the analyses carried out in 
                      the book. One alternative would be simply to present the 
                      Lisbon objectives as politically determined external goals 
                      to which labour market policies should adjust, but that 
                      appears to be a quite limiting perspective for a global 
                      understanding of the issues involved.<br>

                      while competently delivered and offering useful insights 
                      on the effects of specific factors on labour supply, the 
                      articles are somewhat limited by the neoclassical approach 
                      adopted. The advantages in terms of clarity for the analysis 
                      of specific relations in given contexts are counter-balanced 
                      by the lack of an overall perspective that goes beyond the 
                      neoclassical labour economics approach, an issue that even 
                      the more general discussion in the fourth part (dealing 
                      mainly with the effects of monetary integration and EU enlargement) 
                      also fails to address. It is perhaps unfair to point out 
                      as a fault in a book on labour economics that it fails to 
                      go beyond the boundaries of labour economics, but one cannot 
                      help feeling that all the analyses conducted are left to 
                      some extent in a vacuum due to the lack of a more comprehensive 
                      framing in terms of political economy.<br>

                      the twentieth century, different nation states built very 
                      different welfare states, and this book is an exploration 
                      of the different provisions made for the unemployed in Germany 
                      and Britain. The author notes persistent controversy over 
                      whether payments should be low and short-term (in order 
                      not to damage employment incentives) or high and long-term 
                      (in order to prevent deprivation). 'Broadly speaking, the 
                      German welfare state views unemployment as a risk that individuals 
                      insure themselves against, with the state administering 
                      the insurance and treating the unemployed according to their 
                      employment record. In Britain, by contrast, the principle 
                      of poverty alleviation provides the basis for compensating 
                      the unemployed. Benefits for the unemployed are primarily 
                      means-tested in Britain, and these are not based on contributions' 
                      (p.2).<br>

                      order to study the consequences of the difference the author 
                      uses longitudinal data from large representative panel surveys 
                      ( - longitudinal data because this enables unemployment 
                      to be studied as a process rather than as a state), and 
                      she categorizes welfare provision using Gallie and Paugam's 
                      work on 'the degree of coverage, including the balance, 
                      between insurance and means-tested benefits; the level of 
                      financial compensation; and the extent of active labour 
                      market programmes' (p.11f), leading to four categories: 
                      the sub-protective, the liberal/minimal, the employment-centred 
                      and the universalistic (p.12). McGinnity also distinguishes 
                      clearly between means-tested and insurance benefits and 
                      discusses the pros and cons of both, and recognises that 
                      a more rigid labour market is partly a function of the welfare 
                      system, meaning that the welfare system might reduce welfare 
                      by making unemployment more frequent and/or of longer duration.<br>

                      are chapters on the labour markets and unemployment in Britain 
                      and Germany (but only up to the mid-1990s), on the development 
                      of benefits for the unemployed, on income poverty amongst 
                      the unemployed, on the process of escape from unemployment, 
                      and on the effect of a household member's unemployment on 
                      the labour market participation of other household members. 
                      The final chapter repeats the conclusions of the previous 
                      chapters and concludes that 'other institutions also matter, 
                      especially the family and the market' (p.177). Interestingly, 
                      McGinnity finds 'a limited effect of receipt of benefit 
                      on the duration of unemployment in Britain, and no such 
                      effect in Germany' (p.179) - but she does find that 'in 
                      Britain women are less likely to move into part-time work 
                      when the husband is receiving means-tested benefits' (p.180)

                      author suggests that a limitation of much research, including 
                      her own, is that it treats welfare regimes as static systems, 
                      whereas in fact they are constantly changing. To map the 
                      changes against the longitudinal data (and against the new 
                      longitudinal data that would be needed) would be instructive, 
                      for it would provide comparisons more related to a real 
                      world in which change is ubiquitous. But for the time being, 
                      she concludes that in Britain the 'unintended consequences 
                      of means-testing' (p.185) - and particularly the consequence 
                      that means-tested benefits discourage the partner of someone 
                      unemployed from seeking part-time employment - need attention; 
                      and she suggests that in Germany the coverage of insurance 
                      benefits should be extended, though she also recognises 
                      that if contributions are imputed to too many people who 
                      are not paying contributions (such as those caring for children) 
                      then those actually paying contributions might lose confidence 
                      in the system.</font></p>
