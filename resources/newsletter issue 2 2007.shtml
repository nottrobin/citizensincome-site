                      Committee), the Citizen's Income Trust distributed a questionnaire 
                      to all MPs. Seventy-one completed questionnaires and eleven 
                      letters were returned. The level of support for a Citizen's 
                      Income was considerable. Forty-one respondents were in favour, 
                      and only eleven against; and of particular interest to Sir 
                      Archy Kirkwood and Dr. Jones was the level of support for 
                      a Royal Commission: forty-six in favour, and only sixteen 
                      against. (Sir Patrick Cormack MP, one of the respondents, 
                      commented in his letter: 'I have long advocated a Royal

                      of the House of Lords. Again we have achieved a substantial

                      against. And this time support for a Royal Commission on

                      sorry to hear of the death of Richard Clements. After being 
                      editor of Tribune and running Neil Kinnock's office, Richard 
                      was Director of the Citizen's Income Trust from 1993 to 
                      1996, when sadly he had to retire because of his own ill 
                      health and to look after his wife Bridget. He was a most 
                      effective Director, and we were very sorry when he had to 
                      leave. Not surprisingly, he was particularly good at raising 
                      the profile of the Citizen's Income debate in the press.

                      December the Department for Work and Pensions reported: 
                      'Our benefits are complex to administer. Our IS/IT systems 
                      are not as integrated as they could be. Sometimes we fail 
                      to follow our procedures. The result is that, in 2005/06, 
                      we overpaid an estimated &pound;1.9 billion through official 
                      and customer error - equivalent to 1.7% of total expenditure. 
                      &#133;.. Our aim is to prevent new error from occurring 
                      by simplifying benefit rules so they are simpler to understand 
                      and administer' (Department for Work and Pensions, Touchbase,

                      Participants supported the idea of work-life balance, but 
                      many found it difficult to achieve. &#133;. Pay levels are 
                      insufficient and, though benefits/tax credits help, they 
                      are complex and badly administered. &#133;.. The clearest 
                      finding was that participants tended to be fundamentally 
                      disempowered - by the unpredictability of the labour market, 
                      the dominance of a 'business case' rationale, their lack 
                      of confidence in childcare provision and a lack of belief 
                      in their employment and benefit rights.'</font></p>

                      Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN) held its Eleventh Congress 
                      in Cape Town, South Africa, last November. This was BIEN's 
                      first Congress since expanding to a worldwide Network in 
                      2004. Until then BIEN had stood for the Basic Income European 
                      Network. However, because BIEN was the only international 
                      basic income network, national networks outside Europe had 
                      been asking for membership of BIEN since the late 1990s. 
                      This has now happened</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Most 
                      members of the new BIEN agreed that South Africa was the 
                      best place to have BIEN's first conference outside of Europe 
                      because a grassroots movement for basic income has been 
                      growing in South Africa since the fall of Apartheid. Many 
                      of the churches, trade unions, HIV activist groups, and 
                      other progressive organizations, support basic income in 
                      South Africa, although most of the leadership of the ruling 
                      African National Congress remains opposed to the idea. Ingrid 
                      Van Niekerk, of the Institute for Economic Policy Research 
                      in Cape Town, organized the Congress.</font></p>

                      Town proved to be a good venue for the Eleventh BIEN Congress. 
                      Several basic income activists from Southern Africa participated, 
                      including Thabisile Msezane, Senior Vice-President of the 
                      South African Council of Churches; Zackie Achmat, of the 
                      Treatment Action Campaign; and Tovhowani Josephine Tshivhase, 
                      Member of Parliament for the ANC. One of the Congress's 
                      most dramatic events was when Bishop Zaphania Kameeta, of 
                      the Evangelical Lutheran Church, slammed his hand on the 
                      podium and said 'Words! Words! Words!' Kameeta argued that 
                      people should begin to create a fund from private donations 
                      that could eventually grow large enough to finance a basic 
                      income in a developing nation.</font></p>

                      his work in the anti-Apartheid movement, was unable to attend 
                      the Congress in person because he was out of the country 
                      at the time. Instead he addressed the Congress by video 
                      tape, in which he strongly endorsed the basic income movement.

                      Congress proved to be a boost to the basic income movement 
                      in South Africa. The event was followed by a large amount 
                      of discussion of the proposal in the South African press, 
                      and the day after the Congress the ANC Minister for Social 
                      Development gave his personal endorsement to the policy.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      prospect for basic income in other developing countries 
                      was also widely discussed at the conference. Claudia and 
                      Dirk Haarmann discussed basic income as a strategy for economic 
                      empowerment in Namibia, Maria da Silva discussed the Scholarship 
                      Family Program as a step toward basic income in Brazil, 
                      and Pablo Yanes suggested that the Universal Citizen Pension 
                      in Mexico City was an opportunity to open the debate on 
                      basic income in Mexico, where, despite booming trade with 
                      the United States, 40 million out of 100 million citizens 
                      live in extreme poverty.</font></p>

                      presentations at the Congress examined diverse aspects of 
                      the basic income debate. Michael Howard, of the University 
                      of Maine at Orono, won the Basic Income Studies essay prize 
                      for his proposal for a resource dividend for the NAFTA region 
                      (Canada, the United States, and Mexico), and Shamshad Begum 
                      Sayed, Head of Women Affairs Human Rights Foundation in 
                      Johannesburg, discussed the Islamic case for basic income. 
                      According to Sayed, one of the pillars of Islam is not voluntary 
                      charity but rather the mandatory redistribution of wealth 
                      from rich to poor. Other presentations by Philippe Van Parijs 
                      (Belgium), Robert Van Der Veen (the Netherlands), Senator 
                      Eduardo Suplicy (Brazil), Daniel Raventos (Spain), Jennifer 
                      Mays (Australia), Julieta Elgarte (Argentina), Eric Patry 
                      (Switzerland), and Guy Standing (Great Britain) gave the 
                      Congress a rounded, international perspective.</font></p>

                      the Congress, BIEN held its Eleventh General Assembly. The 
                      first item on the agenda was a series of proposals to completely 
                      overhaul the statutes that have served BIEN with minor alterations 
                      since 1988. All of the proposed amendments were approved 
                      unanimously and the new rules seemed to work well as the 
                      meeting went on to more contentious issues such as a proposal 
                      to endorse specific government proposals. The Assembly approved 
                      Dublin as the venue for the 2008 BIEN Congress. All of the 
                      members of the Executive Committee who stood for a further 
                      term were re-elected. Jurgen de Wispelaere decided not to 
                      stand, and was replaced by Louise Haagh, of the University 
                      of York (UK). Eri Noguchi, Ingrid Van Niekerk, Karl Widerquist, 
                      and David Casassas retained positions on the committee. 
                      Sean Healy, of the Council of the Religious of Ireland, 
                      was later added to the Executive Committee as the representative 
                      of the local organizing committee of the Dublin Congress. 
                      At the close of the meeting, and following their re-election 
                      as BIEN's co-chairs, Senator Eduardo Suplicy and Guy Standing 
                      made a joint announcement that they would retire as chairs 
                      when their new terms expire in 2008. </font></p>

                      sixth annual congress of the US Basic Income Guarantee (USBIG) 
                      Network took place at the Crown Plaza Hotel, Times Square, 
                      in New York City, on Friday 23 to Sunday 25 February 2007. 
                      It was held in conjunction with the Eastern Economics Association's 
                      annual meeting, and organised with apparent simplicity and 
                      effectiveness by Karl Widerquist, aided by the USBIG committee. 
                      A core of about 30 enthusiasts patronised the whole USBIG 
                      programme, while possibly another 20 or so wandered in and 
                      out from the main conference to give, or listen to, a paper. 
                      This provided a way in which the BI ideas might pollinate 
                      the minds of more traditional economists. The relatively 
                      small number present lent an intimate and friendly atmosphere 
                      to the proceedings, and made it possible to get to know 
                      new acquaintances more easily. Participants from the USA 
                      were joined by delegates from Canada, New Zealand, South 
                      Africa, Brazil, Netherlands and Ireland, as well as from 
                      the UK. I was impressed with the level of knowledge and 
                      technical detail displayed by the participants, compared 
                      with some larger conferences where newcomers present papers, 
                      but use technical terms in inappropriate ways (such as 'means-tested 
                      basic incomes').</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      programme was organised into eleven sessions, the themes 
                      of which included 'The Ethics of BIG'; 'Finance and the 
                      Basic Income Guarantee'; 'Family Care Work and Gender'; 
                      'The Politics of Basic Income', which covered two sessions; 
                      'Economic Issues of BIG'; 'Alternative Anti-Poverty Programs'; 
                      and 'A Debate: Income guarantees vs. Job Guarantees'.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I 
                      felt very privileged to have been invited to give the opening 
                      address, which I entitled 'Basic Income, Necessary but not 
                      Sufficient: some women's issues', in which I chose to answer 
                      the question 'To what extent could a basic income meet the 
                      problem that women do about two-thirds of the world's unpaid 
                      domestic and care-giving work and receive only about a third 
                      of the world's income?' My conclusion was that a BI scheme 
                      could help to keep women and children out of poverty, and 
                      it could be adjusted somewhat to help redress the balance 
                      slightly. However, in order to bring about real equality 
                      for women in their care-giving roles, other major policy 
                      instruments would have to be brought to bear. </font></p>

                      is impossible to summarise every paper, but two in particular 
                      stood out for me. In his paper, 'The Rise and Fall of a 
                      Basic income Guarantee Bill in the United States Congress', 
                      Al Sheahan recorded the work involved, and the frustrations 
                      experienced, in getting a bill introduced into the US Congress 
                      in 2006. From the initial suggestion during the 1st USBIG 
                      conference in 2002, that USBIG needed a BIG bill in the 
                      US Congress, through the introduction by Californian Democrat, 
                      Bob Filner, of a bill with the catchy title 'The Tax Cut 
                      for the Rest of Us Act', given the number HR 5257 on 2 May 
                      2006, to its subsequent languishing, due to the lack of 
                      support from any Republican co-sponsors, Sheahan charted 
                      the steep learning curve of a small group of amateurs who 
                      made no pretence of having any political expertise. The 
                      bill proposed a moderate annual $2000 'refundable standard 
                      tax credit' per adult and $1000 per child, which would operate 
                      through the federal income tax forms, even for those without 
                      any income. They hoped that it would be financed by rolling 
                      back the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, which

                      the immediate outcome was disappointing, all had not been 
                      lost. The small group had gained much experience, the bill 
                      was a peg on which to hang discussion within the wider community, 
                      and Bob Filner was willing to give it another go in the 
                      next administration. </font></p>

                      second paper, 'Time to change America by Challenging Economic 
                      Fundamentals' by Richard Cook, who spent 21 years as an 
                      analyst with the US Treasury Department, began by cataloguing 
                      the symptoms of decline that are evident in the American 
                      economy. He noted that 'the USA has supported its domestic 
                      economy through trade domination of most of the rest of 
                      the world', but now the world is changing, and China and 
                      India are becoming major players. The US Treasury has an 
                      enormous deficit, which has been purchased in recent years 
                      by China and Japan. However, the worldwide dollar hegemony 
                      is beginning to slip, the value of the dollar having been 
                      declining continuously for more than half a century, and 
                      now China is starting to offload its dollars. The wars in 
                      Afghanistan and Iraq are adding to the US debt. The domestic 
                      situation is really bad for the 12% who live below the official 
                      poverty line, but economic insecurity is a feature of life 
                      for all except for the richest 20% of the population, who 
                      have never had it so good. The federal national minimum 
                      wage of $5.15 per hour is insufficient to keep a family 
                      of three out of poverty. Cook continued by describing the 
                      features of economic life which dog ordinary Americans, 
                      including high unemployment, easy access to debt, soaring 
                      costs for higher education and health care, a house price 
                      bubble which has burst, and a negative US household savings 
                      rate. 'The solutions to the economic side of the problem 
                      proposed by the Democratic leadership in Congress would 
                      only nibble around the edges.' When the US economy is in 
                      even deeper trouble, then the politicians might be prepared 
                      to look at more radical proposals. Cook offered a raft of 
                      other more progressive solutions, including the introduction 
                      of a guaranteed annual income for all citizens. Even $2,000 
                      for an adult and $1,000 for each child 'would be a first 
                      step toward a true basic income guarantee that could eliminate 
                      the scourges of poverty and homelessness that give the lie 
                      to every politician who claims our economy is either fair 
                      or fundamentally sound'. An added advantage is that it would 
                      give a much-needed boost to the flagging demand side of 
                      the US economy, which cannot match the output poured out 
                      by the supply side. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Two 
                      other interesting topics were raised during the conference. 
                      One was a discussion about whether the BIG should be based 
                      on justice, being a dividend from the economy or the land 
                      (via a Land Value Tax, LVT, for instance), in which everyone 
                      was a shareholder, and thus everyone should receive the 
                      same, regardless of age (child or pensioner) and need, or 
                      whether it should be a grant based on compassion and therefore 
                      vary according to need. Michael Collins from Eire was using 
                      an analysis of deprivation data to fix a level for a BI, 
                      and Almaz Zelleke was looking at alternative combinations 
                      of levels for single adults, lone parents and children in 
                      the USA that would meet certain criteria. A full BIG was 
                      often put forward at the poverty subsistence level of about 
                      $10,000 per annum (about 22.9% of GDP per head) for a single 
                      able bodied adult in the USA (comparable to &pound;5,000 
                      pa in the UK, roughly &pound;100 pw, which is regarded as 
                      quite generous and optimistic in many quarters in the UK, 
                      especially compared with the current Income Support levels). 
                      An alternative level of $6,000 pa was also discussed. Several 
                      advocates of LVT were among the participants, and the advantages 
                      of LVT for tackling the enormous inequalities of wealth, 
                      (perhaps in addition to an income tax for redistributing 
                      income) were obvious. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      second was the question of whether asylum seekers and immigrants 
                      should be eligible for the BIG. The fact that one illegal 
                      immigrant had frozen to death on the outskirts of New York 
                      just before the conference began gave an added poignancy 
                      to the question. The welfare programmes in the USA are very 
                      limited and are being cut back fast by the Bush administration. 
                      Tensions are built up if immigrants are perceived to be 
                      receiving more than the locals, but if the locals are getting 
                      very little anyway, it is hard to undercut them except by 
                      giving the immigrants nothing. The incidence of a BIG would 
                      change this, and the question is whether immigrants would 
                      get the same as the locals, or have to fulfil some residency 
                      qualification first, over a few years. Many of those present 
                      wanted immigrants to be treated compassionately, but had 
                      no answer as to the unintended consequences that might occur. 
                      Sean Healy of the Conference of Religious of Ireland, CORI, 
                      pointed out that since the enlargement of the EU, the number 
                      of people now in Ireland who had not been born in Ireland 
                      was 12%, or 1 in 8, which was a higher proportion than in 
                      the USA. Michael Howard put forward a proposal for a guaranteed 
                      minimum income for the NAFTA countries of Canada, USA and 
                      Mexico. In some ways, this is a debate that should take 
                      place in the context of a BI in all countries, with subsidies 
                      from rich countries to poorer ones, such that there is less 
                      incentive to emigrate to avoid the grinding poverty in the 
                      poorest countries. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">There 
                      were many more very interesting papers. Richard Caputo compared 
                      how far countries differed according to their various anti-poverty 
                      programmes, and examined how far they had progressed in 
                      their attempts to introduce a BI. Brazil came out best, 
                      so far. Nadine Schenk's paper 'Political Constraints to 
                      Implementing a Basic Income Grant in South Africa', gave 
                      an analysis of the steps that are needed to rally support 
                      for the idea in order get a bill on the statute books. Michael 
                      Samson and Ingrid Van Niekerk gave evidence about how universal 
                      benefits promote development in less developed countries, 
                      giving examples from South Africa. In all, it was a very 
                      satisfying and stimulating event.</font></p>

                      Network (BIEN) was founded: a key tool in coordinating and 
                      disseminating work on BI. It was also the year that Robert 
                      van der Veen and Philippe Van Parijs published their seminal 
                      article 'A Capitalist Road to Communism'. The article made 
                      a forceful argument for the introduction of BI as an alternative 
                      to the socialist route to communism. BI, van der Veen and 
                      Van Parijs claimed, would free people from the necessity 
                      of securing their own subsistence and thus offer them the 
                      opportunity to find fulfilment in their work.</font></p>

                      these two anniversaries is the launch of Basic Income Studies 
                      (BIS), the first academic journal specialising on BI. The 
                      journal looks to establish an exciting new forum for future 
                      research. As the editorial acknowledges, research into BI 
                      has to date tended to be spread patchily across a variety 
                      of journals and is often inaccessible to those with an interdisciplinary 
                      interest in the topic. BIS is an attempt to remedy this 
                      situation. The journal will publish articles written in 
                      a non-technical style with the aim of drawing in a diverse 
                      readership. </font></p>

                      will appear online twice a year and will be formed around 
                      three sections. The first will feature a set of peer-reviewed 
                      articles by new researchers as well as established academics. 
                      The second will take the form of a debate, composed of 'snapshot' 
                      comment articles that stimulate controversy and open up 
                      new themes. The final section will be for book reviews.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      first edition opens with three articles, each considering 
                      an issue with important implications for BI: workfare, migration 
                      and trade union attitudes. The first of these issues is 
                      taken up by Joel Handler and Amanda Sheely Babcock who argue 
                      that workfare, as it has been implemented in the US and 
                      the EU, has failed clients with shoddy planning, little 
                      monitoring and harsh penalties for non-compliance. The authors 
                      conclude that BI would be a favourable alternative as it 
                      would offer the poor an exit option from employment schemes 
                      and thus boost their standing in the client-caseworker relationship.

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Michael 
                      W. Howard's article considers migration in relation to BI. 
                      He raises the possibility of a dilemma facing BI advocates: 
                      on the one hand they may wish to help the global poor gain 
                      admittance to rich states; on the other hand they must acknowledge 
                      the fact that large-scale immigration could make a national 
                      BI in rich states politically, if not economically, unsustainable. 
                      Howard offers no easy solution to this dilemma. He suggests 
                      that cross-border assistance to the global poor, perhaps 
                      in the form of a regional or global BI, would make border 
                      restrictions more defensible. Even in the absence of such 
                      measures, however, he is prepared to continence the idea 
                      that border restrictions might be a necessary short term 
                      measure to fulfil the special duty citizens of rich states 
                      owe to their poorest members not to make them worse off 
                      than they already are. </font></p>

                      Vanderborght's article considers trade union attitudes to 
                      BI. As large organisations whose purpose is to advocate 
                      on behalf of those who tend to be less well off, unions 
                      may seem obvious candidates to push BI forward. After considering 
                      evidence from Belgium, Canada and the Netherlands, however, 
                      Vanderborght finds little to support this assumption. In 
                      these countries the typical reaction of unions to BI has 
                      been cool, to say the least. In Belgium, where the BI movement 
                      is most developed, it has, ironically, received the strongest 
                      opposition from unions. Vanderborght explores reasons to 
                      explain this hostility. First, BI may be strategically unappealing 
                      as it may seem a utopian distraction from more realizable 
                      goals. Second, it may be economically unappealing as it 
                      may make the labour market more flexible, and undermine 
                      job security and, perhaps, wages. Third, it might be normatively 
                      unappealing as workers may fear BI would involve parasitism 
                      by the idle. Interestingly, Vanderborght still concludes 
                      that BI advocates should work to convert unions to their 
                      cause, but perhaps, given his analysis, advocates would 
                      have better luck turning to other groups that may be more 
                      responsive, e.g. the unemployed.</font></p>

                      debate section is dedicated to a retrospective on 'A Capitalist 
                      Road to Communism' on the twentieth anniversary of its publication. 
                      The article is reprinted beside six insightful comments 
                      by critics. The first of these is by GA Cohen, who, in never 
                      previously published notes made back in 1987, argues that 
                      van der Veen and Van Parijs offer mutually inconsistent 
                      replies to two objections against basic income: that it 
                      licenses exploitation of the industrious by the lazy and 
                      that it unjustifiably violates state neutrality between 
                      those who like to work and those who like leisure. Of the 
                      other comments, two provide arguments for BI as a device 
                      for the realisation of important moral values: Andrew Williams 
                      considers occupational choice, Catriona McCinnon, self-respect. 
                      Another two (by Erik Olin Wright and Harry F Dahms) engage 
                      with the Marxist theme of the original article and offer 
                      their own views on BI-reformed-capitalism as an alternative 
                      to socialism. Finally, Doris Schoeder expresses concerns 
                      regarding global justice not unlike Howard's. A national 
                      BI, she claims, could mean diverting resources away from 
                      the global poor. A global BI, she adds, although ethically 
                      appealing is politically unrealistic. </font></p>

                      their reply to their critics van der Veen and Van Parijs 
                      offer not only carefully considered responses but also a 
                      useful summary of how their work has developed since 1986. 
                      In particular they explain how they have responded to the 
                      neutralist objection that Cohen offers with a justice argument 
                      for BI. Finally they provide their own thoughts on the national 
                      BI versus global justice debate, arguing that if - as some 
                      empirical evidence suggests - states which share their wealth 
                      more equitably amongst themselves are more likely to share 
                      it with others, then national BI might be a good first step 
                      on the road to global justice. </font></p>

                      book reviews are probing and informative, covering a range

                      impressive first edition. If the standard is maintained 
                      Basic Income Studies is sure to become a must-read journal.

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">From 
                      the title, this collected volume of essays sounds like a 
                      companion volume to Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott's 1999 
                      book, <i>The Stakeholder Society</i> (New Haven, Yale University 
                      Press), and it almost is. All of the chapters touch on their 
                      proposal in some way, and the book concludes with a chapter 
                      by Ackerman replying to some of his critics in the volume. 
                      But the editors' opening essay defines Stakeholding more 
                      broadly than Ackerman and Alstott, as 'a particular paradigm 
                      within social policy that looks to empower individuals by 
                      granting them or helping them to acquire assets or a near 
                      equivalent guaranteed future stream of income.' Ackerman 
                      and Alstott focus on one such policy, basic capital. That 
                      is, a lump sum coming of age grant, which is, in their proposal, 
                      $80,000 for all high school graduates who aren't convicted 
                      of a felony by their 21st birthday. Dowding, De Wispelaere, 
                      and White consider two other kinds of Stakeholding proposals, 
                      universal basic income (which provides a small, lifetime 
                      stream of income) and target asset-building (which subsidizes 
                      savings and investment). Ackerman and Alstott's proposal 
                      remains the main focus of the book, and the other proposals 
                      are discussed largely in relation to the basic capital proposal. 
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Several 
                      chapters put forth Stakeholding proposals. Julian Le Grand 
                      and David Nissan discuss the baby bond initiative, a very 
                      small basic capital grant, which is since be adopted by 
                      the British government. Gavin Kelly, Andrew Gamble, and 
                      Will Paxton discuss a proposal for subsidized savings accounts. 
                      And Robert E. Goodin discusses an Australian proposal for 
                      capital grants to the unemployed. His basic idea is that 
                      a person who has been unemployed for a year can propose 
                      and investment project to the Department of Social Security. 
                      If the Department finds it is feasible, they grant or lend 
                      the individual as much as two-years-worth of unemployment 
                      benefits to get the project underway. It is a very interesting 
                      proposal, but Goodin pays too little attention to the question 
                      of whether it will encourage people who might have gone 
                      back to work in less than 12 months to stay unemployed for 
                      the full year so that they can become eligible for the grant.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Two 
                      chapters, one by Stuart White and one by Gijs van Donselaar, 
                      discuss the issue of whether unconditional grants allow 
                      people who may not be working to take unfair advantage of 
                      workers whose taxes support the grant. White concludes that 
                      a one-time grant or a temporary basic income can give the 
                      disadvantaged greater opportunities and protect them in 
                      times of crisis without interfering with a lifetime obligation 
                      to contribute to society through work. Van Donselaar is 
                      more skeptical, criticizing Ackerman and Alstott's funding 
                      of the stake through an inheritance tax as 'a tax on love.' 
                      He endorses a modified version that provides a voucher that 
                      will ensure that the stake is used only for productive investments.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Three 
                      chapters criticize Ackerman and Alstott's proposal. C&eacute;cile 
                      Fabre criticizes Stakeholding for being insufficiently egalitarian, 
                      but most of her criticism amounts to the claim that Stakeholding 
                      is merely a step in the right direction rather than the 
                      full solution. Carole Pateman addresses Ackerman's allegation 
                      that the choice of basic income over basic capital is paternalistic. 
                      She argues that basic income must be preferred to basic 
                      capital not for paternalistic reasons but because of the 
                      power and economic security which basic income gives to 
                      individuals (and that basic capital does not). Robert van 
                      der Veen argues that for all of Ackerman and Alstott's criticism 
                      of basic income as paternalistic, their system has quite 
                      a few restrictions on individual behavior. There are conditions 
                      attached to the stake; individuals are to receive a citizen's 
                      pension (rather than being told to save their stake for 
                      retirement), and in between they advocate substantial welfare 
                      state protections. Van der Veen estimates that if Ackerman 
                      and Alstott replaced all of these other provisions by adding 
                      equivalent values to the stake they could up its value by 
                      nearly three fold to $228,000. Van der Veen observes that 
                      while Van Parijs is consistently focused on the desire to 
                      maximize 'real freedom', some other unexplained value principle 
                      is competing with Ackerman and Alstott's desire to increase 
                      economic opportunity.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Probably 
                      the most interesting part of the book is Ackerman's concluding 
                      chapter. Surprisingly, he devotes nearly half of the chapter 
                      to a rebuttal of van Donselaar's exploitation allegation. 
                      This had special interest to me, because I have spent more 
                      time criticizing van Donselaar than possibly anyone else 
                      so far ( - a chapter in <i>The Ethics and Economics of the 
                      Basic Income Guarantee</i>, an article in Political Studies, 
                      and these were the result of four working papers on www.usbig.net) 
                      - but even I began to feel for him after the way he was 
                      handled by Ackerman. Those with an interest in the exploitation 
                      objection will be interested in how Ackerman shows that 
                      some of the conclusions van Donselaar draws from his models 
                      are assumption-specific, and how he defends liberal education 
                      against van Donselaar's case for training individuals to 
                      be more productive. Van Donselaar made the tactical mistake 
                      of accusing Ackerman of failing to 'think through these 
                      conceptual complexities.' Ackerman is a venerable, prestigious 
                      political theorist, who was able to dismiss van Donselaar's 
                      accusation with an overwhelming amount of self-citations. 
                      Van Donselaar left himself wide open to this and so it was 
                      a fair tactic by Ackerman. However, although the response 
                      was extremely effective rhetorically, it might have allowed 
                      Ackerman to escape more substantive parts of van Donselaar's 
                      criticism. </font> </p>

                      edition of the Rutgers Journal of Law and Urban Policy is 
                      forward-looking in a variety of respects. 1. It is published 
                      as a booklet which contains the abstracts of papers given 
                      at the 10th Congress of BIEN in 2004 (the Basic Income European 
                      Network: now the Basic Income Earth Network) accompanied 
                      by a CD which contains the papers themselves; 2. There is

                      papers constitute an important debate between Basic Income 
                      and Guaranteed Employment as approaches to social policy 
                      reform. William Mitchell and Martin Watts argue that governments 
                      have a responsibility to provide a job for anyone who can't 
                      find one; Guy Standing argues that a Basic Income is a necessary 
                      precondition for a right to work, as it would give to people 
                      the right to a job of their choosing; Jos&eacute; Antonio 
                      Noguera argues that a Basic Income would contribute to our 
                      status as citizens whereas a job guarantee promotes our 
                      status as workers; Axel Marx proposes a lottery game which 
                      provides the winners with a Basic Income as a means of choosing 
                      a sample to conduct a social experiment; Michael Howard 
                      asks questions about the nature of work; Erik Olin Wright 
                      describes a Basic Income as a socialist project; John Tomlinson 
                      thinks that Australia's mind-set will need to change before 
                      either a job guarantee or a Basic Income would be possible; 
                      Jos&eacute; Luis Rey P&eacute;rez distinguishes between 
                      the right to work, the freedom to work, and labour rights; 
                      and both Philip Harvey and Pavlina Tcherneva and L. Randall 
                      Wray suggest that the job guarantee and Basic Income proposals 
                      are complementary.</font></p>

                      to envisage a book on economics and taxation among the world's 
                      best-sellers is a significant stretch of the imagination 
                      for many people. Yet here is such a book. Progress and Poverty 
                      by Henry George has, since its first publication in 1879, 
                      sold millions of copies throughout the world.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">However, 
                      in recent years, the 600 odd pages of the original have 
                      proved too much for contemporary readers, and it was allowed 
                      to go out of print. In order to correct this, and to make 
                      George's work known to a wider audience, Bob Drake of the 
                      Chicago Henry George School began a five year project to 
                      'translate' the language, one idea at a time, into a more 
                      modern idiom. This is the result, pruned down to half the 
                      original length, yet still containing all the ideas and 
                      arguments. </font></p>

                      first published so long ago, this book still has an important 
                      message for all concerned with the inequalities of wealth, 
                      the causes of poverty and possible solutions. The book's 
                      central message is, in Henry George's own words: </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">'The 
                      association of poverty with progress is the great enigma 
                      of our times. It is the central fact from which spring industrial, 
                      social and political difficulties that perplex the world, 
                      and with which statesmanship, philanthropy and education 
                      battle in vain.'</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">As 
                      wealth increases, poverty spreads and deepens, but he is 
                      clear that this is not inevitable. There is a way in which 
                      the world's wealth can be more equally shared. The essential 
                      problem lies in the unequal ownership of land and resources. 
                      George examines the remedies currently proposed (at the 
                      time of writing) such as increased government efficiency 
                      and regulation, better education, unions and co-operatives 
                      and even the nationalisation and redistribution of land, 
                      and finds all of them wanting. This abridged edition makes 
                      it clear that this is as true today as it was then. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">His 
                      remedy is clear and simple: 'We must make land common property'. 
                      However, this does not mean what it appears to at first 
                      sight. He rejects the idea that all land be nationalised 
                      or re-distributed, and we have only to look at what has 
                      happened in Zimbabwe, for example, to see that he is right. 
                      To be effective, he says, a remedy must flow with both the 
                      essential harmony of the universe and the natural development 
                      of society. One wonders what he would have made of the growth 
                      and decay of communism. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Ownership, 
                      whether of land or anything else, relies on the right of 
                      the individual to the fruits of his or her labour, and this 
                      relationship must be fair. This has, for George, a spiritual 
                      basis. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">'The 
                      laws of nature are the decrees of the Creator. They recognise 
                      no right but labour. As nature gives only to labour, the 
                      exertion of labour in production is the only title to exclusive 
                      possession.'</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      means that people may only profit from land that they own 
                      by working it, and not in any other way. It is rent that 
                      he would seek to take out of private hands and put to public 
                      use. If this were done, he suggests, we would not need any 
                      other form of taxation. Whether we agree or not, his ideas 
                      demand consideration by all who are concerned with tax reform, 
                      and with workers receiving just rewards for energy expended, 
                      whether in 'paid' or 'unpaid' employment.</font></p>

                        must be paid and the community maintained.</font></li>

                        taking as little as possible from the people beyond what 
                        it yields the government.</font></li>

                        should be certain - offering the least opportunity for

                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It 
                        should bear equally - giving no-one an advantage, nor

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">If 
                      universally adopted, these 'canons' could underlie substantial 
                      reform of the taxation system, and allow the funds for a 
                      citizen's income to be generated. The basis of this tax 
                      is to limit social and commercial elites in their capacity 
                      to monopolise natural abilities and deny the same right 
                      to others. It is based on a single tax on location values 
                      (not merely land values, as George was prophetically aware 
                      that location is all important, particularly in the development 
                      of city structures). We only have to look at the spiralling 
                      rents in our cities to see the relevance of this. </font></p>

                      conclusion, I will only say that I tried to read the original 
                      many years ago, but gave up before finishing it. I suppose 
                      I was not sufficiently interested at that time, and the 
                      language and length of the book were against me.. This new 
                      edition is a different story. It held my attention from 
                      beginning to end, and left me feeling that the work of this 
                      pioneer still has a valid message for the 21st century. 
                      It deserves to be read again, even if you have the original. 
                      Whether or not you agree with his conclusions, reading it 
                      will raise sufficient questions to make the effort worthwhile.</font></p>

                      America Beyond Capitalism takes this concern to an academic 
                      level by systematically analysing the components of the 
                      current political economy in the United States. Alperovitz 
                      discusses the ideals of capitalism, democracy, equality, 
                      and liberty; he believes that they are virtually absent 
                      in the United States. He suggests that the only solution 
                      to this dilemma is an overhaul of the economic, political, 
                      and social systems. </font></p>

                      The first chapter provides evidence for the deepening inequalities 
                      in society. The next chapter deals with liberty and the 
                      two distinct trends in society that threaten the culture 
                      of liberty: one that restricts personal liberties, and the 
                      other that relates to the fundamental issues of the political-economic 
                      system as a whole. The third chapter addresses the importance 
                      of democracy at a macro and at a micro level in a stable

                      rather than a minority, and asks about the technical and 
                      political feasibility of such a change. Alperovitz recommends 
                      worker-owned firms, new forms of municipal businesses, the

                      funding, retirement savings, health care provisions, and 
                      a shorter work week in order to encourage political participation. 
                      Part V suggests that just as transformative shifts have 
                      shaped the United States throughout its history, we too 
                      should expect and hope for the same. The concluding chapter 
                      brings the book and the goals of a new model of attaining 
                      a pluralist commonwealth together.</font></p>

                      book offers a good synopsis of the literature and provides 
                      real-world examples of strategies which would lead to the 
                      proposed pluralist commonwealth. Whilst there is discussion 
                      of the redistribution of wealth, and of the necessity of 
                      long-term strategy rather than a short-term strategy in 
                      this area, the implementation of a Citizen's Income is not 
                      discussed. This is a pity, as such a policy would contribute 
                      to the liberty, democracy and redistribution for which Alperovitz 
                      hopes. However, some of the ideals and proposals would provide 
                      useful theoretical underpinning for a Citizen's Income.

                      contains the usual wealth of detail and relevant comment. 
                      Of particular interest is the conclusion that half of the 
                      children who remain in poverty are in families already doing 
                      paid work, which suggests that the proposition that paid 
                      work is the way out of poverty does not apply for many households. 
                      The authors say that the underlying problem is low pay and 
                      that a low-paid couple can only avoid poverty if both partners 
                      are in paid employment. Another interpretation would take 
                      more account of high marginal withdrawal rates which mean 
                      that because of benefit and tax credit withdrawal increasing 
                      earned income translates into gross income which increases 
                      at a far lower rate than the rate at which earned income 
                      rises. </font></p>

                      report rightly welcomes lower poverty rates among pensioners,

                      conclude that means-tested benefits such as Pension Credit 
                      do not address the root of the pensions problem. </font></p>

                      researchers conclude that the overall picture is one of 
                      success and neglect rather than one of success and failure. 
                      Where government has taken action there has been measurable 
                      reduction in poverty. Where it has not taken action, poverty 
                      and inequality have continued to increase. Given the continuing 
                      poverty amongst working age adults and families with children 
                      which the report discovers, action on the structure of the 
                      tax and benefits system would seem to be the next piece 
                      of necessary action.</font></p>

                      researchers seek trends in the employment patterns of older 
                      workers in the European Union with the aim of identifying 
                      policy initiatives which would encourage more flexible and 
                      later retirement. In most of the countries which were in 
                      the EU before its recent substantial enlargement nearly 
                      half of adults over fifty years old are either unemployed 
                      or inactive, living on a mixture of early retirement pensions 
                      and benefits, though recent pensions reforms will probably 
                      induce many of them to work until they are older. The statistics 
                      show that older workers are either in full-time employment 
                      or are inactive, which can make the transition into retirement 
                      problematic. The authors therefore identify a need for policies 
                      which will encourage part-time employment in order to promote 
                      flexible and later retirement. What the authors call the 
                      current 'cliff-edge' fall into retirement isn't good for 
                      people, and for more flexible retirement to be more of a 
                      possibility would therefore be good for people's health.

                      of us who have supported CI for years may feel that perhaps 
                      we could do without an endorsement for our ideas from the 
                      likes of Charles Murray. He achieved notoriety in 1994 with 
                      his book (co-written with Herrnstein) on 'The Bell Curve', 
                      which seemed to suggest that racism was acceptable, because 
                      some races are irredeemably less intelligent than others. 
                      This was a development to his on-going obsession with a 
                      social-welfare created under-class, in an earlier book Losing 
                      Ground (1984). Murray is a man who seems to relish notoriety, 
                      and to enjoy antagonising those who do not agree with him. 
                      He also appears to be a good-natured prankster who will 
                      follow whatever outrageous trail his high intellect leads 
                      him to. But make no mistake, Murray is highly influential 
                      in right-wing policy circles, and his endorsement of CI 
                      is a significant landmark. His name on the cover will ensure 
                      that this book will probably sell more, and be read by more 
                      people than all the other books on Citizen's Income put 
                      together.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Not 
                      that he calls it CI, nor does he make any reference to the 
                      wealth of literature already available on the subject, from, 
                      for example Philippe van Parijs. (This seems to be a deliberate 
                      snub. He operates in a well-funded right wing think-tank, 
                      the American Enterprise Institute, and acknowledges the 
                      assistance of many fellow researchers - some of whom must 
                      have pointed out the existing body of information on CI). 
                      Indeed, his Plan, to 'convert all transfer payments to a 
                      single cash payment for everyone age twenty-one and older' 
                      (p9) has no name other than 'The Plan'. By converting all 
                      welfare payments, Murray calculates that a payment of $10,000 
                      (&pound;5,100) p.a. could be made. But there is a twist-once 
                      earnings from other sources, mostly jobs, exceeds $25,000, 
                      the payment will be surtaxed at 20%. This means those individually 
                      earning more than $50,000 will receive no net Plan-money.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Murray 
                      does acknowledge one source for this idea-negative income 
                      tax (NIT), as proposed by Milton Friedman. During the 1970s 
                      a version of NIT was tried out, but the results were so 
                      abysmal that it was quietly shelved. * High marginal rates 
                      of tax destroyed work-incentives for the low paid. Murray's 
                      Plan overcomes this effect of NIT and thus rehabilitates 
                      Friedman's earlier idea. For both of these right-wing market 
                      fundamentalists, welfare payments of any kind are anathema. 
                      Ideally they would like to abolish welfare, but NIT or the 
                      newer Murray-Plan is a 'way of reaching out across the political 
                      divide between libertarians and social-democrats, offering 
                      a compromise for dealing with human needs without entailing 
                      the suffocating and soulless welfare state' (p xii).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      his eagerness to embrace market solutions Murray also proposes 
                      to abolish state-funded pensions as well as such state-sponsored 
                      medical schemes as exist in the US (Medicare and Medicaid). 
                      With an unshakeable belief in the beneficence of market-provision, 
                      Murray calculates that basic health insurance for all, as 
                      well as adequate retirement pensions can be provided by 
                      abstracting $3,000 from the $10,000 payment under his Plan. 
                      This is, to say the least, highly contentious. By flogging 
                      his Friedmanesque hobbyhorse of free markets he distracts 
                      from his main argument. In reality his Plan pays each individual 
                      $7,000 per year (that's about $20 or &pound;10 per day). 
                      In the UK our negative experiences of private-sector pension 
                      provisions (Maxwell, mis-selling scandals) and our positive 
                      experience of the NHS (better life expectancy than the US 
                      for half the GDP cost) supports the idea that state provision 
                      is not always as malign as Murray imagines.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Murray 
                      goes on to explain that his planned $7,000 p.a. individually 
                      paid to all those over the age of 21 would cure involuntary 
                      poverty. No mention is made of Child Benefits-none are payable 
                      in the US apart from tax allowances. The main losers from 
                      the Plan would be single mothers; Murray suggests that they 
                      have an alternative source of income to hand in the form 
                      of the fathers of their children. All these 'dead-beat dads' 
                      will be known to possess an income under the Plan, as well 
                      as an identifiable bank account. With a little help from 
                      the authorities, single mothers can enforce their claim 
                      against the fathers. If that fails, mother can escape poverty 
                      by taking a part-time job at the minimum wage, says Murray 
                      (p57). Curiously for a right-wing ideologue, Murray does 
                      not challenge minimum wage legislation; indeed many of his 
                      justifications for his Plan are predicated on minimum wage 
                      legislation continuing-a strange anomaly.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      labour market would be affected by the Plan in various ways: 
                      employment traps (disincentives to taking a job) caused 
                      by conditional welfare payments would vanish, so more would 
                      choose to work. Wives of well-paid men (Murray only reads 
                      off traditional gender stereotypes) might prefer to stay 
                      at home, content with their Plan-money. Some might choose 
                      to work fewer hours in jobs. Overall Murray feels the total 
                      hours worked in the economy would drop, but only slightly.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Warming 
                      to his theme of the underclass, Murray lapses from his libertarian 
                      ideals and shows his visceral hatred for two groups in particular: 
                      Young (under 21) mothers, will have the full rigours of 
                      economic destitution applied, and have every incentive to 
                      behave, to avoid pregnancy and find work at any job going. 
                      Also any male who does not get a job, if under 21 will equally 
                      have the goad of destitution, or if over 21 and he chooses 
                      to loaf at home with parents or girl-friend, will soon find 
                      that he must pay up part of his Plan money or be 'kicked 
                      out', as Murray puts it (p67). </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Why 
                      the systematic meanness towards the under 21s in particular? 
                      Murray is worried that they might be tempted to become hippie 
                      drop-outs. Of course a major activity for most 18 to 21-year-olds 
                      in the US is education. With no Plan-money to support them, 
                      how will they pay their way? Murray suggests two courses 
                      of action: rely on welfare in the form of subsidised student 
                      loans and grants, or mortgage their future Plan payments. 
                      (I am sure the second would be illegal; the first seems 
                      exactly the sort of state-subsidy that Basic Income should 
                      replace. Murray seems determined to rescue his studied parsimony 
                      towards youngsters at all costs, even violating his own 
                      principles). Not that gap years for the over-21s are to 
                      be frowned on. Murray shows his more magnanimous side here: 
                      Yes, if a few older guys decided to be beach bums for a 
                      year or two, he is relaxed about that. In time such inactivity 
                      will pall, and these layabouts will re-integrate into decent 
                      hard-working society. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      framing his Plan, and identifying its consequences, Murray 
                      feels confident that it would work, and with the right push 
                      behind it should pass through as legislation. Those of us 
                      who have studied schemes for Basic or Citizen's Income over 
                      the years will first look at winners and losers to identify 
                      a constituency for change: It is here that the Plan looks 
                      weak indeed. The 18-21 year-olds, who can both vote and 
                      serve in the military, who find themselves excluded from 
                      this payment would be (rightly) outraged. The underclass 
                      which Murray fears so greatly could become a swollen and 
                      enraged mob. This is neither politic nor libertarian. More 
                      important politically would be the large group in the middle, 
                      the 'ordinary decent hard working families' that politicians 
                      like to wax lyrical about. Although the Plan cleverly avoids 
                      the traps caused by the 100% withdrawal rate of the old 
                      NIT schemes, other difficulties arise at a later stage. 
                      Those with incomes between $25,000 and $75,000 would be 
                      hit with a higher income tax rate, as much as 7% higher 
                      for those on a very middling income of $50,000 (based on 
                      Murray's graph on p149). I doubt if middle America would 
                      vote for such a scheme. Left out, and so un-engaged in most 
                      of the benefits and drawbacks of Murray's Plan, are the 
                      well-off. Anyone earning more than $100,000 will not be 
                      affected by the Plan (apart from his wife, of course, as 
                      explained above!). These movers and shakers will see no 
                      reason to support such a Plan, even less so if it unleashes 
                      a horde of destitute 18-21 year-olds on society. I am very 
                      dubious about the practical politics of the Plan, but stranger 
                      things have emanated from right-wing US think-tanks and 
                      have been adopted by compliant administrations.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It 
                      is a relief to turn to the bigger picture, and the message 
                      of hope for better lives for all that Murray proposes. Unfortunately 
                      he cannot miss an opportunity to take a swipe at European 
                      social welfare states. These are held responsible for the 
                      misery of divorce, the rise of the underclass and even the 
                      loss of religion. Such tedious and easily refutable nonsense 
                      serves Murray's case ill. He refers to the alternative-Rifkin's 
                      'How Europe's vision is quietly eclipsing the American dream' 
                      (2004), but only in a note at the back. So much for 'extending 
                      a hand to the social democrats'!</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">On 
                      a more positive note, concerning the pursuit of happiness, 
                      Murray makes some really good points: that personal relationships 
                      matter, that self-respect is important, that man (sic) is 
                      a social animal who seeks the respect of others, that humans 
                      will expend effort for the general good-what is called 'altruism', 
                      without expectation of reward, other than feeling good about 
                      themselves. All of this would be unremarkable, banal even, 
                      but for one thing: It flies in the face of the hegemonic 
                      doctrine which underpins the 'free' market, most notably 
                      espoused in Public Choice theory. This assumes that man 
                      is a rational being who makes selfish choices about maximising 
                      his own satisfaction. Greater satisfaction grows from greater 
                      consumption according to this theory. Murray, whether he 
                      realises it or not, clearly disagrees with the Neoclassical 
                      economists' model of rational economic man. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">One 
                      of the great liberating effects of CI is on work and jobs: 
                      writers like James Robertson suggest that 'ownwork' could 
                      replace much of conventional employment, especially demeaning 
                      and unethical jobs. Murray has a different take on this. 
                      He sees jobs as a form of 'vocation' (his chapter title). 
                      Employment is to be retained as a core activity, with the 
                      added benefit that labour mobility becomes easier. As well 
                      as boosting the economy, this enables people to find their 
                      true calling, even if that involves moving around. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In 
                      a chapter on marriage, Murray bemoans the present fractured 
                      state of this core relationship. It's all the fault of the 
                      welfare state, he predictably asserts (p110). His Plan money 
                      will support stable married relationships: Mothers who want 
                      to work can hire nannies; it is also easier for wives to 
                      stay at home to look after children and husbands. The platform 
                      of the Plan-money encourages the taking on of responsibility, 
                      unlike the welfare provisions which provide a safety net 
                      which encourages fecklessness. Apart from the blatant sexism 
                      in these sentiments, Murray is unsure if divorce will be 
                      more or less widespread.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Murray 
                      also anticipates communitarian benefits from his Plan. Again 
                      he demonises the welfare state for supplanting a rich web 
                      of community organisations. There once was an amazing range 
                      of community, ethnic and religious self-help groups in the 
                      US, which have been superseded by welfare provision. Under 
                      the Plan, there could be a return to widespread small-scale 
                      voluntary local provision. Here Murray seems to have missed 
                      altogether the reason for the demise of many local voluntary 
                      organisations (apart from their functions being far less 
                      needed)-that the increasing engagement of both men and women 
                      in the labour market, and the longer hours being worked 
                      makes it much more difficult to find the time to volunteer. 
                      This is a consequence of the dominance of markets, not welfare, 
                      and the belief that jobs are the only valid form of work. 
                      It is big business which sucks life out of communities, 
                      not welfare provision. There is an alternative vision of 
                      voluntary organisation which CI can enable-that jobs in 
                      the profit-making sector can be shunned, and employment 
                      in worthwhile activities, even if poorly or un-paid become 
                      feasible.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      is not a state-bureaucracy versus voluntary provision argument 
                      as Murray tries to picture it. It is a power equation: Since 
                      big business and the money-interest have the power and money, 
                      they bend the behaviour of the populace to fit their needs, 
                      and rely on the state to control the reserve armies of the 
                      excluded underclass. Liberated by CI, individuals can choose 
                      to build their lives in fulfilling ways, freed from the 
                      control of needing to find a job to earn basic money to 
                      live on. This would be a more authentic libertarian dream. 
                      Murray, who claims to be a libertarian, is unable to see 
                      that although welfare provision does inhibit some desirable 
                      behaviour, it is the power and control of business and money, 
                      which are the main causes of lack of liberty. Take government 
                      off our backs for sure (in so far as it is doing any harm), 
                      but first chain up the monster which has nearly all of us 
                      in its grip: the power of money and big business. Perhaps 
                      Murray understands this all too well, but needs to be careful 
                      not to antagonise his paymasters at the American Enterprise 
                      Institute.</font></p>

                      get an income merely because they need one begs the question 
                      of why they need one. After all, there was less abject poverty

                      to earn an income, is worth a fortune if it is surrounded 
                      by productive people. The people who pay rent are, in the

                      towns, and enables landowners in those cities and towns

                      each citizen has a right to a share of the rent. A modern 
                      way to introduce this sharing of land rent would be to introduce 
                      an annual levy on all sites. The levy (or Annual Land Value 
                      Tax) would be a fixed percentage of the site value but the 
                      amount paid would vary according to the financial benefit 
                      each landowner derives from their land. Endorsements for 
                      land value tax continue to this day from across the political

                      are really just specialized land value taxes. In Edmonton, 
                      Canada and Alaska, some of the royalties from oil production 
                      are returned to their citizens as a dividend each year.

                      be paid to all citizens. Even London's congestion charge, 
                      championed by Mayor Ken Livingstone, is a sort of rental

                      congestion shows that marginal cost pricing works, i.e. 
                      if you charge for a scarce resource (in this case city centre 
                      road space) - people will use it more efficiently. Similarly, 
                      if we charge for the use of the natural resources on our 
                      planet (including land) - people will use them more efficiently.</font></p>

                      taxes can (and should) supplement a general land value tax, 
                      but none of them are as directly connected to each person's 
                      birthright as land value tax is, and none of them have the 
                      revenue potential that land value tax has. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Because 
                      a land value tax is a charge against privilege, pure and 
                      simple, powerful interests will always oppose it, but many 
                      people support it for that same reason. For what other tax 
                      proposal can you cite Thomas Carlyle, Winston Churchill, 
                      Richard Cobden, Aldous Huxley, Thomas Jefferson, John Locke, 
                      John Stuart Mill, Moses, Tom Paine, William Penn, Spinoza, 
                      Adam Smith, Tolstoy, Mark Twain, Karl Marx, seven winners 
                      of the Nobel Prize in Economics and countless others in 
                      support of your position? </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">A 
                      land value tax, buttressed by resource royalties, pollution 
                      charges and congestion charges, is the perfect revenue source 
                      to fund the citizens' income. </font></p>
