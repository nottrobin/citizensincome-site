                      1 reports on a study of the different tax and benefits systems

                      found among mothers with young children in the two countries. 
                      The researchers write: 'Based on our empirical results, 
                      we &#133; conclude that part of the differences in employment 
                      patterns can &#133; be explained by the different work incentives

                      on board the message that high marginal deduction rates 
                      damage work incentives. In his recent budget report he suggests 
                      that 'the poverty trap occurs when those in work have limited 
                      incentives to move up the earnings ladder because it may 
                      leave them little better off. Marginal deduction rates (MDRs) 
                      measure the extent of the poverty trap by showing how much 
                      of each additional pound of gross earnings is lost through 
                      higher taxes and withdrawn benefits or tax credits. &#133;.'.

                      Benefit is important because it isn't withdrawn as other 
                      income rises. Until now, though, Child Benefit has been 
                      effectively withdrawn by taking it into account in the calculation 
                      of other benefits. Ceasing to take it into account when 
                      Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit are calculated will 
                      reduce the marginal deduction rates for many low-earning 
                      families and, as the Chancellor correctly predicts, have 
                      a big impact on child poverty: both because the change will 
                      increase net incomes and because it will create greater 
                      incentives to increase earned income.<br>

                      January the <b>Institute for Fiscal Studies</b> published 
                      its 'Green Budget', which examines the options available 
                      to the Chancellor of the Exchequer as he approaches his 
                      budget announcement. The report says that 'the tax and benefit 
                      reforms since 1997 will have increased the incomes of the 
                      poorest tenth of the population by 12.4% (&pound;1,300 a 
                      year) and reduced those at the top by 5.5% (&pound;4,200 
                      a year)', but that those changes to be implemented this 
                      April 'will not reduce the very high marginal tax or deduction 
                      rates faced by those with the weakest work incentives' (p.268). 
                      On simplification: 'The government has reaffirmed its commitment 
                      to simplify the tax system, but attempts by this and previous 
                      governments to deliver real and long-lasting reductions 
                      in complexity have usually come to nothing and the volume 
                      of tax legislation has grown inexorably. The rewrite of 
                      direct tax legislation, initiated under the last Conservative 
                      government and still in progress, uses simpler language 
                      but at much greater length and without resolving any of 
                      the underlying complexity in the legislation. &#133; Real 
                      simplification is difficult to achieve without more fundamental 
                      consideration of what, who and how we tax. Tackling complexity 
                      requires that we recognize what is complex and why, and 
                      focus on what can sensibly be done about it,' (p.260). </font></p>

                      the first <b>World Social Security Forum</b> held in Moscow 
                      from the 10th to the 15th September 2007, Michael Cichon, 
                      the Director of the International Labour Office's Social 
                      Security Department, made an appeal for immediate action 
                      to reduce global insecurity and poverty. Presenting supportive 
                      evidence from Europe, he underlined that social security 
                      has helped reduce poverty levels by around 50 per cent. 
                      This same result should be possible for all countries, he 
                      insisted. And it was affordable. What was lacking, however, 
                      was political will. To make his case, Mr Cichon set about 
                      debunking three myths: that poorer countries cannot afford 
                      social security, that social security expenditure acts to 
                      undermine economic growth, and that the benefits of national 
                      economic growth are automatically shared by all. As a response, 
                      Mr Cichon argued that a basic package of universal social 
                      security benefits should be possible for all countries. 
                      This would cost no more than 5 per cent of national GDP, 
                      he emphasised. </font></p>

                      The report identifies a low National Minimum Wage and the 
                      disincentive effects of in-work benefits as two of the reasons 
                      for there being so many working families who remain poor. 
                      The authors make recommendations in relation to the National 
                      Minimum Wage, and they also suggest changes to Tax Credits: 
                      'We recommend the introduction of a Personal Tax Credit 
                      Allowance (PTCA). A PTCA would give all individuals in eligible 
                      families their own personal allowance - allowing them each 
                      to earn up to &pound;99.84 a week (or &pound;5,210 a year) 
                      before their families' Working Tax Credit entitlement started 
                      to be withdrawn. For a dual-earner family this would mean 
                      a combined allowance of almost &pound;200 a week. &#133;.. 
                      Where families responded to this improved incentive, and 
                      a second adult moved into work, it would bring savings to 
                      the state in virtually all cases' (p.50). </font></p>

                      Vienna has published an assessment of the UK's tax credit 
                      system: Tax Credit Policy in the UK and its lessons for 
                      Austria: <a href="http://www.euro.centre.org/detail.php?xml_id=1109">http://www.euro.centre.org/detail.php?xml_id=1109</a>. 
                      The report concludes: 'Taking the long-term view, the problems 
                      encountered in the tax credit policy in the UK were worth 
                      the pain. Despite all its flaws, tax credit policy has played 
                      an important role in the outcome that, during the last decade, 
                      600,000 children have been lifted out of poverty (compared 
                      to the doubling of child poverty that occurred over the 
                      previous 20 years). The question is whether it was necessary 
                      to use a system with an almost 15% inaccuracy rate to achieve 
                      this. Perhaps not. If Austria were to introduce such a policy, 
                      it has to measure how such wastage could be avoided or kept 
                      to a minimum. The conclusions with respect to work incentives 
                      of the British schemes are mixed. There is definitely a 
                      strong incentive for single parents to return to work. One 
                      particular area of weakness is the work incentives for a 
                      'second' earner in the family: the eligibility conditions 
                      for a couple are the same as for a single person (even though 
                      the poverty line is 30 per cent higher for couples). There 
                      are also weaknesses in providing incentives to increase 
                      working hours beyond what ensures entitlement, and this 
                      is mainly because of the fact that other benefits (particularly 
                      Housing Benefits) are withdrawn rather quickly once income 
                      from work starts to rise. &#133;&#133; The main challenge 
                      to the WTC [Working Tax Credit] in the United Kingdom has 
                      been its administrative difficulties towards responsiveness 
                      to income changes.' </font></p>

                      and Peter Kenway. The report concludes that 'the period 
                      of slow but steady progress in reducing poverty has now 
                      come to an end, arguably around three or four years ago. 
                      In particular, overall poverty levels in 2005/06 were the 
                      same as they were in 2002/03. Child poverty in 2005/06 was 
                      still 500,000 higher than the target set for 2004/05. In 
                      addition, the unemployment rate among the under 25s has 
                      been rising since 2004 while the rate for those 25 and over 
                      stopped falling in 2005. The proportion of working-age people 
                      who are economically inactive but want work (a group not 
                      classified as 'unemployed', a majority of whom are disabled) 
                      also appears to have stopped falling. Tax credits are taking 
                      greater numbers of children out of poverty - around a million 
                      in each of the last three years - but the number of children 
                      in working families whose earnings and Child Benefit are 
                      insufficient by themselves to escape poverty is also rising. 
                      Half the children in poverty belong to working families. 
                      And while inequality in the lower half of the pay distribution 
                      is narrowing, and women are catching up with men (but are 
                      still well behind), pay inequality in the upper half of 
                      the pay distribution is growing. Overall earnings inequalities

                      to the other recommendation for consideration, we reflected 
                      on the success - first in analysis, then in presentation 
                      of solutions and then in public acceptance - of the Turner 
                      commission on pensions, and suggested that perhaps it was 
                      time for a welfare commission. Beveridge assessed what sort 
                      of society we would have post-war, and what sort of social 
                      security system we wanted for that society. There has been 
                      no real consideration of the fundamentals since 1945 - it 
                      is 60-odd years since Beveridge published his report. There 
                      are serious grounds for going back to basic principles, 
                      and saying, 'This is the society, labour market and mobility 
                      - or lack of it - that we have. What sort of benefit system 
                      do we need that allows that society to function but that 
                      also removes all barriers and disincentives to people to 
                      work?'<br>
                      We are firmly of the view - I evangelise about this - that 
                      this country has enough people with sufficient credibility, 
                      academic rigour and intelligence to staff a commission such 
                      as the Turner commission. They could take two, three or 
                      four years - I am not bothered - but they would present 
                      for public debate and to Parliament a possible model for 
                      where we will be in 10, 15 or 20 years' time.<br>

                      we also need to bear in mind that making things tidier is 
                      not just an academic exercise; there are also serious and 
                      vital advantages to having a simplified benefits system, 
                      and it is worth reminding ourselves about them because they 
                      are the prize at which this debate is aiming. They are simple, 
                      and there are far fewer of them than the causes of complexity-there 
                      are three or four at most.<br>

                      we can reduce error. We can do that on behalf of staff. 
                      They need a PhD to understand most of what is going on in 
                      the system at the moment; it is therefore understandable 
                      that mistakes are made-and that is before we move on to 
                      the problems caused by computer systems, ... The complexity 
                      is also a problem for claimants, because as we have just 
                      heard, they cannot be expected to understand the entire 
                      system. They are even less likely to understand it than 
                      the people who work as benefits experts within the system. 
                      Inevitably, claimants will make mistakes. That makes life 
                      hard for them and potentially exposes them to accusations 
                      of fraud even if they make a mistake in good faith.<br>

                      second advantage to simplification is that we can improve 
                      take-up. It is striking that child benefit, one of the simplest 
                      benefits, has one of the highest levels of take-up of any 
                      of them. It is one of the most successful, and the impact 
                      on poverty and on reaching the Government's stated objectives 
                      for the benefits system would be profound if we could improve 
                      the take-up of other benefits in the same way. That might 
                      cost more, but I understand that the Government have reserves 
                      in their financial estimates. &#133;..<br>

                      919) <i>John Penrose</i> &#133; there are at least two things 
                      that are seriously worthy for consideration as a thought 
                      starter, which might lead to the building of a <br>
                      consensus. One is the idea that we should combine working 
                      age tax credits, jobseeker's allowance, income support and 
                      the new employment support allowance in one overall benefit, 
                      with the condition placed on it that a person would have 
                      to be willing and able to work before it was paid to them. 
                      That may or may not be a good idea, but it is seriously 
                      simpler than what we have at the moment, and it avoids an 
                      enormous amount of the problems related to change of circumstances 
                      and to the cycle of people going in and out of work that 
                      I described before. It also avoids the problems relating 
                      to the linking rules.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                      proposed a marginal deduction rate as a clawback mechanism 
                      to avoid the problems of means-testing, where anyone who 
                      went into work would have their benefit withdrawn at a particular 
                      rate to be decided by the Government. Such a system would 
                      be an awful lot faster and simpler to administer than the 
                      current tax credit system, because it would simply require 
                      the Department for Work and Pensions to inform Her Majesty's 
                      Revenue and Customs of a single number for every person 
                      earning a wage, which would then be withdrawn through their 
                      tax code. Again, that may be a good idea or it may not, 
                      but all we wanted was a constructive and considered response 
                      from the Government. I am sad to say that that is not what 
                      we got. On page 18 of the Government's response, they afforded 
                      the entire idea only this:<br>
                      'The Committee's model is more radical - a form of Citizens

                      went on to say: 'As described it appears, at least at first 
                      sight, to carry a risk of both very high expenditure and 
                      reduced work incentives.'<br>

                      lazy, complacent, arrogant and weak, and I believe that 
                      it shows that the Government are scared. I know that we 
                      need to do better, and I sincerely hope that the Minister

                      for only a few moments because I do not want to repeat all 
                      of the points already made by other hon. Members. We all 
                      agree that the benefits system in this country is extremely 
                      complicated. We all agree that it should be simplified, 
                      and I suspect that we all agree that we are not quite sure 
                      how that might be achieved. Achieving that end will probably 
                      be a lot more complex than it first appears. The hon. Member 
                      for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose) was perhaps slightly 
                      modest in not explaining that most of the ideas in annex 
                      A, which he has just outlined, were his own, but he is right 
                      to say that the rest of the Committee bought into them.<br>

                      have been attracted to the concept of a single working-age 
                      benefit since I joined the Select Committee on Work and 
                      Pensions in 2001. However, the longer I have looked at how 
                      it might work in practice, the more I have realised that 
                      a single working-age benefit would be much more complex 
                      than some of those who propose it lead us to believe. It 
                      is superficially attractive because it seems simple and 
                      clear, but we need to ensure that those who lead complex 
                      lives or have complex needs continue to get the support 
                      that they do under the present system, despite its complexities 
                      and all the forms that individuals have to fill in. As a 
                      country, we need to decide a way forward, and work out the 
                      best way to simplify the benefit system in order to get 
                      the son of Beveridge; 60 years on, our country is a different 
                      place, and we need a very different benefit system.<br>

                      proposal in the Select Committee report for a welfare or 
                      benefits commission along the same lines as the Turner commission 
                      on pensions is the right way forward. There has been a unified 
                      voice in the Chamber this afternoon, saying that that would 
                      allow the Government to take time, stock and even a step 
                      back and begin to consider the benefits system as a whole 
                      rather than its individual pieces, and instead of tinkering 
                      with improvements and reforms here and there. We all know 
                      that reforming one part of the benefits system often has 
                      unintended consequences and knock-on effects on other parts. 
                      Therein lies the problem and the complexity.<br>

                      for the best of reasons, attempts have been made to simplify 
                      benefits, but we have ended up with historic rights, which 
                      the Chairman of the Select Committee mentioned this afternoon. 
                      For all the reasons to which he referred, and because we 
                      still operate systems to ensure that individual claimants 
                      are not worse off in cash terms, we have a complex system.

                      The Government now have an ideal opportunity to act because, 
                      for the first time in several years, a brand new benefit 
                      is being introduced - the employment and support allowance. 
                      The basis for that allowance could be the basis on which 
                      a single working age benefit could work. Some of the groundwork 
                      has already been done, but we need a much broader investigation 
                      into what a benefits system in the 21st century should be 
                      and how the different elements should interact.<br>

                      take it on - could build political consensus. In the same 
                      way as we needed political consensus for a pensions system 
                      that would last not for 10 or 20 but for 50 years, we need 
                      to build a welfare system today that will, like that of 
                      Beveridge, last for 60 years. We cannot do that without 
                      all-party support, or without engaging with not only people 
                      in this place but those who depend on the welfare system,

                      Brunton's talk, 'Tackling Child Poverty: Future Challenges', 
                      looked at alternative definitions of relative poverty and 
                      of current causes of poverty, and identified the groups 
                      most at risk. In 1997, 1 in 3 children in the UK, i.e., 
                      between 3 and 4 million, lived in poverty. This was one 
                      of the worst records in Europe. In 1998/9, the Government 
                      set targets to reduce child poverty by a quarter by 2005, 
                      by a half by 2010, and to eradicate it by 2020. Brunton 
                      outlined the three-fold strategy adopted to tackle the problem, 
                      through greater employment, financial support in the form 
                      of Child Tax Credits, and the provision of high quality 
                      public services for all families.<br>
                      Professor Adrian Sinfield was scathing about the UK Government's 
                      record on tackling child poverty, pointing out that there 
                      was no framework for such a policy, that there was no guaranteed 
                      adequate income for families with children, and that the 
                      Government's first target had not been met. The government 
                      criticises the population's 'poverty of aspirations', but 
                      does not recognise its own poverty of aspirations for tackling 
                      poverty. Government benefit levels are even lower than their 
                      own poverty benchmarks. The Government should attack poverty, 
                      not the poor. Sinfield emphasised the need to prevent poverty, 
                      not just to plug the holes after the event. As with clean 
                      water or clean air, so with benefits; prevention is better 
                      and cheaper than cure. He cited the gender pay gap, and 
                      the undervaluing of service sector work, as being linked 
                      to child poverty. He pointed out that if only the respect 
                      now shown for wealth and money-making (where annual incomes 
                      of &pound;100,000 and over are growing by 7-10% pa, according 
                      to Anthony Sampson) were accorded to the problems at the 
                      lower end of the scale, they would soon be solved. <br>

                      roundtable discussions were interesting, with many well-informed 
                      contributions. The Nordic countries, Denmark, Sweden and 
                      Finland, with their lower inequality rates, together with 
                      Belgium, have managed to cut their child poverty rates to 
                      less than 10% and came out of the discussion well. While 
                      Child Benefit was the most successful benefit that the UK 
                      has ever implemented, Child Tax Credit, the current Government's 
                      preferred option, has become part of the problem. The problem 
                      of in-work poverty was discussed. Only one third of poor 
                      families is jobless. The need was recognised for a family-friendly 
                      industry, countering the culture of long hours in the UK 
                      and providing flexible working for parents. A much larger 
                      set of groups of children who are at risk of poverty was 
                      identified than those mentioned by Chris Brunton, including 
                      children-in-care, young carers, and children with disabilities. 
                      Reference was made to The UN Convention of the Rights of 
                      the Child, (signed by all countries except Somalia and the 
                      USA), which advocates the promotion of the well-being of 
                      the child. It accords with my own view that, while an appropriate 
                      benefit system with adequate benefit levels is a necessary 
                      condition, it is not sufficient by itself, and that other 
                      services, including access to affordable childcare and decent 
                      work opportunities, education, housing and health services, 
                      are also necessary to create 'the good society'.<br>

                      as it is to believe today, there was a brief period when 
                      the United States government seemed inevitably bound to 
                      adopt some form of guaranteed income. The idea seemed to 
                      emerge from nowhere in the mid-1960s, when it was suddenly 
                      discussed by most major political actors. President Nixon 
                      proposed a watered-down version of the guaranteed income, 
                      which overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives, 
                      only to be narrowly defeated in the Senate. The idea continued 
                      to be discussed during the Ford and Carter administrations, 
                      but by 1980 it was out of mainstream politics. <br>

                      Steensland is a professor of sociology at the University 
                      of Indiana. His new book, the Failed Welfare Revolution: 
                      America's Struggle over the Guaranteed Income Policy, chronicles 
                      the history of the guaranteed income movement of the 1960s 
                      and 70s, examining how and why it sprang up so suddenly, 
                      took on its air of inevitability, and as quickly disappeared 
                      from the political mainstream.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Steensland's 
                      work is extremely thorough. He seems to have found every 
                      speech and article by every politician, pundit, columnist, 
                      union leader, nonprofit director, and political activist, 
                      who ever spoke or wrote on the issue. He discusses the internal 
                      squabbles of the Nixon administration from which the administration's 
                      version coalesced into 'the Family Assistance Plan.' He 
                      reports on which Senators and Representatives supported 
                      or opposed the bill in committee, who changed their minds, 
                      when and why. His thoroughness makes the book tough going 
                      at times, but serves a worthy purpose. Steensland paints 
                      a vivid picture. Reading this book I feel as though I know 
                      what happened, what went wrong, and what opportunities were 
                      lost.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      guaranteed income emerged in policy circles in the mid-1960s 
                      as the confluence of several events, among them the growth 
                      in political attention to poverty, the belief that something 
                      must be done about the welfare system to help reduce poverty, 
                      and the endorsement of the guaranteed income by widely divergent 
                      policy experts. The guaranteed income briefly became the 
                      consensus view of economists, who put it forward as the 
                      scientific solution to poverty. The guaranteed income faced 
                      the prospect of being able to attract broad support from 
                      both left and right. For those on the left, the guaranteed 
                      income offered greater freedom and less supervision for 
                      the poor and a breakdown of the distinction between the 
                      so-called deserving and undeserving poor. For those on the 
                      right, it offered greater incentives for people receiving 
                      public assistance to enter the labor force and greater support 
                      for the working poor-usually believed to be the most deserving 
                      of all.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instead, 
                      the Family Assistance plan managed to alienate critics of 
                      the welfare system from both left and right. Many welfare-rights 
                      activists viewed the plan as a reduction in welfare benefits 
                      for the most needy; and many conservatives viewed it as 
                      a major expansion of the number of people 'on the welfare 
                      rolls.' The defeat stemmed largely from Nixon's failure 
                      to capture the rhetoric. His speeches largely played into 
                      the hands of the plan's opponents. Even so, the defeat was 
                      extremely narrow. Had Nixon been willing to expend more 
                      political capital on it, to make the right promises, and 
                      to twist the right arms, he may well have got it through 
                      the Senate in 1970. Instead, critics of the plan took the 
                      initiative and created new policies, such as the Earn Income 
                      Tax Credit, that incorporated some aspects of Family Assistance 
                      Plan, but reinforced the distinction between the so-called 
                      deserving and undeserving poor.<br>

                      the late 1970s the opportunity was gone. The 'welfare mess' 
                      remained a political concern, but poverty did not. By the 
                      time Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, poverty was no longer 
                      seen as a problem in need of a better solution. The welfare 
                      system was seen as the problem, and the most popular solution 
                      was for government to do less to address poverty. <br>

                      author's early chapters contain histories of pensions and 
                      of pensions policy in the UK, and these parts of the book 
                      will be useful to students of the subject. What emerges 
                      is government preference for means-tested and asset-tested 
                      pensions (now in the form of Pensions Credit) rather than 
                      for uprating the contribution-based basic state pension. 
                      It is interesting that Hill defines Pensions Credit as the 
                      'first tier', followed by the National Insurance pension 
                      and the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) as 
                      the 'second tier', with a third tier being that of occupational 
                      and private provision. A more traditional listing would 
                      have put the National Insurance pensions first. Hill's listing 
                      relates well to the Government's preference for means-testing 
                      and also to OECD policy which is expressed using the same 
                      three tiers in the same order. (The International Association 
                      for the Study of Insurance Economics employs a listing different 
                      again: the first pillar is both means-tested and contributory 
                      state pensions; the second is occupational pensions; the 
                      third is private pensions; and the fourth is income earned 
                      after retirement age. *)<br>

                      Citizen's Pension appears in the glossary and then frequently 
                      in the book as an option for reform worth studying, and 
                      Hill is surprised that the Government's Pensions Commission 
                      didn't visit the Netherlands to study their Citizen's Pension 
                      (p.97). The fact that it does work in the Netherlands suggests 
                      that the Government here should not have been so quick to 
                      dismiss the option in their recent White Paper (p.164). 
                      Hill argues that today's means-tested system (which the 
                      White Paper does nothing to alter) discourages private provision 
                      for old age, and he advocates a Citizen's Pension on the 
                      grounds that it will encourage both saving and older people's 
                      labour market participation. <br>

                      is accessible, wide-ranging, and well organised, and text 
                      boxes offer definitions and discussions of particular concepts 
                      and issues. (Given the market clearly envisaged, it's a 
                      pity that chapters don't end with suggestions for further 
                      reading and with questions to provoke thought on what the 
                      student has read).<br>
                      Part I is titled 'understanding poverty' and contains chapters 
                      on definition, poverty in different societies, and statistics. 
                      Then follow sections based on particular definitions: 'poverty 
                      as material need', 'poverty as economic position', 'poverty 
                      and social relationships', and 'poverty as a moral concept'. 
                      The final two sections are on 'explanations for poverty' 
                      ( - on why people are poor, and on why some countries remain 
                      poor) and 'responses to poverty'.<br>

                      style is often combative, and in the final section it is 
                      sometimes particularly so. Thus in relation to the slogan 
                      'teach a man to fish and you feed him for life': 'This is 
                      staggering arrogance &#133;.. Why do we imagine that people 
                      in developing countries do not have the basic skills for 
                      survival? Could we survive under the same constraints? Do 
                      international organisations really know more about fishing 
                      than people who spend their lives doing it?' (p.135).<br>

                        protection is not targeted on the poor, then, and it is 
                        debatable whether a focus on poverty is even a primary 
                        consideration. It is perhaps surprising, then, to discover 
                        that some of the national welfare systems which are most 
                        effective in dealing with poverty, like those in Northern 
                        Europe, have been based on the principle of social protection 
                        rather than poor relief. The schemes which do best, like 
                        provision for older people in Sweden, are the ones which 
                        provide for people regardless of need. Schemes which offer 
                        a 'safety net' do not do so well in securing a minimum 
                        income. If a system is based on support for everyone, 
                        poor people will also be helped. If it supports only the 
                        poor, some are likely to be excluded (p.136).<br>

                    <blockquote> 
                      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                        lump-of-labor argument implies that there is only so much 
                        useful remunerative work to be done in any economic system, 
                        and this is indeed a fallacy. It is more correct to say 
                        that an economy can adjust to create jobs for willing 
                        workers. In the longer run, as prices and wages adjust 
                        to changes in technology and tastes, to supplies and demands, 
                        jobs will come to workers or workers will move to jobs. 
                        And in the short run, this process can be lubricated by 
                        appropriate macroeconomic policies. A look at history 
                        or across countries shows that there is no fixed lump 
                        of labor to be distributed-there is no need to ration 
                        out scarce work among the army of unemployed workers.

                        1891, an economist, D.F. Schloss, described such thinking 
                        as the lump of labour fallacy because, in reality, the 
                        amount of work to be done is not fixed. Government-imposed 
                        restrictions on the amount of work people may do can actually 
                        reduce the efficiency of the labour market, thereby increasing 
                        unemployment. Shorter hours will create more jobs only 
                        if weekly pay is also cut (which workers are likely to 
                        resist) otherwise costs per unit of output will rise. 
                        Not all labour costs vary with the number of hours worked. 
                        Fixed costs, such as recruitment and training, can be 
                        substantial, so it will cost a firm more to hire two part-time 
                        workers than one full-timer. Thus a cut in the working 
                        week may raise average costs per unit of output and cause 
                        firms to buy fewer total hours of labour. A better way 
                        to reduce unemployment may be to stimulate demand and 
                        so increase output; another is to make the labour market 
                        more flexible, not less.</font></p>

                      view of the LoLF has remained unchallenged (indeed virtually 
                      unmentioned) from within academic economic circles, although 
                      some outsiders do not accept the full logic of the case. 
                      (See for example what Tom Walker of Seattle has to say 4). 
                      Even Samuel Brittan accepts that in the short-run, adjustment 
                      may require sacrifices by workers, and Samuelson acknowledges 
                      that for some groups of workers job-sharing may make sense. 
                      So the academic, theoretical case seems pretty water-tight: 
                      It is wrong to say that the number of jobs is fixed. Given 
                      flexible markets, the amount of paid employment can be expanded 
                      to equal whatever number is required by those willing to

                      started back in 1984, I, like most of the others in at the 
                      start, was concerned by the appalling rise in the numbers 
                      of the unemployed. 'Instead of wasting billions keeping 
                      huge armies in idleness, wouldn't it be better to pay them 
                      an unconditional weekly income, and let them find something 
                      useful to do?' was an obvious reaction, and so the idea 
                      of Basic Income took off. Hermione Parker actually called 
                      her 1989 book on CI <i>Instead of the Dole</i>. We too, 
                      it seems, had fallen for LoLF. If so, we had some strange 
                      bedfellows: the Thatcher government, composed of convinced 
                      free-market believers. When market liberalisation failed 
                      to cure mass unemployment, the 1980s Tory government moved

                      reduce unemployment by sharing jobs more widely. This was 
                      one of the moves taken by EU countries to harmonise and 
                      reduce working hours, and it was supported widely by trade 
                      unionists. Did reducing working hours and job-sharing lead 
                      to less unemployment? The short answer is 'No'. The evidence 
                      for this can be found in the economic literature (5):<br>

                      women's jobs, the numbers have increased by about one million 
                      for each. In the longer term (over 30 years) the picture 
                      is different: since 1971 the number of jobs for men has 
                      decreased. For women the story is one of almost continuous 
                      increase, with 50% more jobs in the same period. The major 
                      social change whereby women choose to participate in the 
                      labour market, rather than stay at home as housewives, produced 
                      a large new lump of labour. The flexible UK labour market 
                      could cope by absorbing them in large numbers, creating

                        The effect takes time. Should a new lump of labour become 
                        available, such as mass layoffs in an industry, they can

                        of a work-leisure substitution effect. (7) Rational workers, 
                        they claim, make a calculation of how many hours they 
                        wish to work, for how much money, weighing this up against 
                        their time free off the job, which can then be devoted

                      not in a job are labelled 'inactive', which seems a nasty 
                      way to describe the efforts of parents caring for children, 
                      to take one example of this 'inactive leisure'. Perhaps 
                      it would be better to rename the LoLF as the 'Lump of Jobs
