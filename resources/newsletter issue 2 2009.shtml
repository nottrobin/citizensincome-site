                      economic crisis is a good time for re-evaluation, and particularly 
                      for re-evaluating how well our tax and benefits system serves 
                      our society and its economy. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
                      is therefore a pleasure to be able to report on the highly 
                      significant results already achieved by a Citizen's Income 
                      pilot study in Namibia. The social change and economic activity 
                      which the study's small Citizen's Income has stimulated 
                      suggests that it is time for additional trial runs not only 
                      in Africa but also elsewhere, so that we can learn as much 
                      as possible about how effective a Citizen's Income might 
                      be in other contexts. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
                      would be particularly interesting to see such a pilot study 
                      in the UK (perhaps in a clearly boundaried community such 
                      as the Isle of Sheppey?). If the results from the Namibian 
                      experiment are as significant as we think they are, then 
                      a Citizen's Income is an opportunity for social and economic 
                      change which the UK must not neglect. If we do neglect it 
                      then surely other countries will not and it will be others 
                      who reap the economic benefits. </font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Guy 
                      Standing started his presentation with the heart of his 
                      message: Poverty is primarily a lack of money, so giving 
                      people money will lift them out of poverty; he then proceeded 
                      to discuss the options facing attempts at poverty reduction 
                      in the developing world and to report on a significant Citizen's 
                      Income pilot project in Namibia.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because 
                      globalisation leads to whole societies suffering economic 
                      shocks, and because such risks are uninsurable, social insurance 
                      is not a viable means of preserving economic security so 
                      essential for an individual's autonomy and freedom. We therefore 
                      need new ways of providing people with enough money to prevent 
                      poverty, and in Professor Standing's view potential schemes 
                      need to pass a number of tests:</font></p>

                      Africa it has now been recognized that cash transfers can 
                      help to alleviate poverty. There are three types: </font></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Universalistic 
                        and unconditional</i></font></li>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Targeted 
                        </i>(usually on groups deemed to be the poorest, often 
                        by means testing)<br>
                        Selective (for instance: in Latin America cash transfers 
                        are received by families who send their children to school)<br>
                        </font></li>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Means-tested 
                        systems</i> (and proxy means-testing based, for instance, 
                        on the quality of a family's housing, as in Chile) suffer 
                        from problems familiar to developed countries, and involve 
                        poverty, unemployment and savings traps, with the resulting 
                        moral and immoral hazards. So in Africa new methods must 
                        be sought. At the BIEN Congress in Cape Town much support 
                        was expressed for unconditional cash transfers, especially 
                        among trades unionists and community and church representatives; 
                        and now in Namibia a pilot scheme involving two villages 
                        is answering the questions put by the idea's critics: 
                        that an unconditional cash transfer would be something 
                        for nothing, would reduce labour supply, would go to the 
                        rich as well as the poor, would be wasted on alcohol and 
                        other undesirable expenditure, would be unaffordable, 
                        and would lower incentives to save. </font></li>

                      by Richard Titmuss in 1958. 'The implication is that what

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                      an otherwise stimulating comment in the previous issue of 
                      the Citizen's Income Newsletter ('Is a Citizen's Income 
                      Scheme the Answer?', Issue 1, 2009), Anne Miller asserts, 
                      though without detailed evidence or argument, that &quot;the 
                      reduced administration costs of CI schemes would enable 
                      the government to reduce its civil service budget&quot;. 
                      Miller is by no means alone in the belief that the introduction 
                      of a Citizen's Income would generate significant administrative 
                      savings: hers is a common conception among proponents of 
                      Citizen's Income. But does the claim stand up? </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                      do not deny that Citizen's Income may have some significant 
                      administrative advantages - not only in terms of the potential 
                      to minimise bureaucratic expense but also in terms of less 
                      &quot;red tape&quot; and official intrusion into citizens' 
                      lives - when compared with more selective approaches to 
                      income support. But Citizen's Income advocates also need 
                      to acknowledge the limits to this argument: specifically, 
                      that it applies only to a narrow subset of the broad range 
                      of proposals that increasingly fall under the rubric of 
                      Citizen's Income; that the argument only applies under a 
                      restricted set of circumstances or background conditions; 
                      and that the extent of the advantage can easily be overstated. 
                      We address each of these points in turn. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, 
                      those who share Miller's view need to be meticulous in stating 
                      which particular schemes would generate administrative savings 
                      - and which do not. The simplest case of replacement of 
                      one or more selective schemes with a non-means-tested, unconditional 
                      refundable tax credit would presumably capture substantial 
                      administrative savings. But this scheme has proven politically 
                      intractable, and for that reason many other proposals have 
                      in recent years attracted support from Citizen's Income 
                      advocates. Unfortunately, the administrative savings from 
                      these other schemes are by no means obvious. In a recent 
                      contribution to this Newsletter (&quot;Why Participation 
                      Income Might Not Be Such a Great Idea After All&quot;, Issue 
                      3, 2008), we highlighted the administrative difficulties 
                      associated with defining, monitoring and crediting the &quot;broad 
                      participation requirement&quot; that is central to Atkinson's 
                      participation income. Similarly, advocates sometimes point 
                      to the way in which a number of selective schemes combine 
                      to mimic the effects of a Citizen's Income. Such strategies 
                      of implementation-by-stealth have a number of advantages, 
                      but administrative simplification is not one of them.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      second concern affects even the unconditional version of 
                      a Citizen's Income, as proposed by Miller. Many of the administrative 
                      costs in such schemes are common to the administration of 
                      quite separate policies. For example, an assessment of individual 
                      income may be necessary for the administration of income 
                      taxes as well as for the entitlement to social security 
                      benefits, and could therefore not be fully eliminated by 
                      the introduction of a Citizen's Income. To be sure, welfare 
                      administration often needlessly duplicates the gathering 
                      of such information, but the solution is surely to advocate 
                      administrative simplification of existing policies and more 
                      joined-up government, rather than a Citizen's Income <i>for 
                      that reason</i>. The more general point is that claims about 
                      the administrative savings yielded by Citizen's Income requires 
                      an analysis of the broader policy and institutional context.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Third, 
                      it is worth pointing out that the extent to which a Citizen's 
                      Income could replace other selective programs and their 
                      associated bureaucratic machinery depends crucially on the 
                      level at which a Citizen's Income is set (a point where 
                      different Citizen's Income advocates disagree considerably). 
                      The functional form of the relationship between administrative 
                      savings and the level of a grant needs careful analysis. 
                      In the absence of such a careful analysis, those who anticipate 
                      significant administrative savings may be disappointed by 
                      actual results. At the very least, those who argue for a 
                      Citizen's Income on the basis of administrative savings 
                      need to be specific about a number of crucial variables, 
                      including the adequacy of the grant, as well as which existing 
                      benefits it will replace. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Underlying 
                      much of the bureaucracy-bashing by Citizen's Income advocates 
                      appears to be an assumption that administration involves 
                      only costs. This is understandable in light of the negative 
                      experience typical of interactions between welfare clients 
                      and bureaucracies. But too much of a fixation with this 
                      experience obscures the extent to which an effective administrative 
                      apparatus is vital if a Citizen's Income is to be substantively 
                      (and not just nominally) universal: providing benefits to 
                      the homeless, disabled, immigrants and others requires positive 
                      effort in addition to the removal of barriers to accessing 
                      a grant. The public administration literature quite rightly 
                      puts a lot of stock in the design of overlapping bureaucratic 
                      systems where, if properly designed, one system captures 
                      what another drops. But such a commitment to substantive 
                      universalism may be hard to justify by those who see slimming 
                      the civil service as an important part of the argument for 
                      Citizen's Income.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
                      is a serious discussion to be had about the administrative 
                      savings aspect of Citizen's Income, and some of the results 
                      may indeed prove to be compelling. But the mere assertion 
                      that Citizen's Income will generate administrative savings 
                      does little to contribute to this discussion. Taken out 
                      of context, the very idea of administrative savings easily 
                      becomes a mirage. </font></p>

                      making a sweeping claim without stating my assumptions in 
                      my short piece 'Is a Citizen's Income Scheme the Answer?' 
                      (<i>Citizen's Income Newsletter</i>, 2009, issue 1, p.5).</font></p>

                      wrote: 'The reduced administration costs of CI schemes would 
                      enable the government to reduce its civil service budget 
                      &#133;.' However, it is amazing how much meaning and interpretation, 
                      for which there is no evidence or intention, S&amp;DW have 
                      been able to squeeze out of my simple statement. Nowhere 
                      in this statement, nor elsewhere in my writings on Citizen's 
                      Income (CI), have I implied that 'a Citizen's Income would 
                      generate <i>significant</i> savings' (my italics); nor do 
                      I 'see slimming the civil service as an important part of 
                      the argument for Citizen's Income.' No one could sensibly 
                      put slimming the civil service as a major objective of a 
                      welfare reform, although many hope that it might be an additional 
                      outcome. (Indeed, if slimming the civil service were the 
                      main objective of a reform then it could be done by abolishing 
                      the welfare system altogether.) Minimising administration 
                      costs must always be a secondary objective, and that secondary 
                      objective will always be to minimise and never to eliminate 
                      administration costs.</font></p>

                      do not know where or when the phrase 'bureaucracy-bashing' 
                      arose, but I certainly do not regard myself in that category. 
                      Any faults in the administrative system are the responsibility 
                      of the designers of the system, and not of the administrators 
                      who are expected to carry out ill-thought-through schemes.</font></p>

                      I agree that it is obvious that the chosen method of administration 
                      can help to fulfil several important objectives, such as 
                      influencing the personal costs of beneficiaries in terms 
                      of their sense of intrusion or discrimination experienced, 
                      and the time and effort required to apply for the benefit. 
                      The administrative method chosen could also affect the opportunities 
                      for fraud.</font></p>

                      costs are likely to be reduced, compared with the current 
                      system.</font></p>

                      I first met up with fellow basic income (BI) cognoscenti 
                      in the environment of the Basic Income Research Group (BIRG) 
                      from 1984 onwards (BIRG became the Citizen's Income Trust 
                      in 1993), I was amazed at how people espousing a similar 
                      idea could be so fiercely argumentative over the details. 
                      This was partly due to the fact that BI is an instrument, 
                      comprising several components, not a specific policy objective. 
                      In its trust deed in 1989, BIRG defined Basic Income schemes 
                      as 'schemes which guarantee to each and every man, woman 
                      and child the unconditional right to an independent income'. 
                      The version 'A Citizen's Income is an unconditional, non-withdrawable 
                      income payable to each individual as a right of citizenship' 
                      has appeared as a strap line at the bottom of page 1 of 
                      the <i>Citizen's Income Newsletter</i> for several years 
                      now. These statements were intended to indicate 1) that 
                      a CI is based on the individual as the tax and benefit unit; 
                      2) that it is universal (being based on citizenship, permanent 
                      residence or domicile, and definitely not on any work tests), 
                      and 3) that it is administered as a benefit, rather than 
                      as a negative income tax (NIT) (a net payment after personal 
                      income tax liability has been deducted) or as a tax credit 
                      (TC) (a deduction from one's personal income tax liability).

                      on these definitions, it is clear CI schemes certainly do 
                      not include hybrid versions, such as participation income 
                      (PI) schemes, even though some of those who prefer such 
                      schemes might claim them as forms of CI.</font></p>

                      relevant questions are these: </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1) 
                      <i>Is a benefit scheme based on the individual likely to 
                      be cheaper than one based on joint applications for all 
                      cohabiting couples, as now?</i></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      administration costs will be a function of the number of 
                      units and the complexity of each case. With a CI the number 
                      may be larger, but the complexities directly due to the 
                      interaction of the partners are likely to be lower.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2) 
                      <i>Is a universal system likely to be cheaper to administer 
                      than one based on means-tested benefits (MTBs) or one based 
                      on worth or desert?</i></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
                      is nothing wrong with the principle of means-testing. Incomes 
                      are means-tested for income tax purposes. One problem associated 
                      with MTBs is that the recipients are assessed twice on the 
                      same criterion (their means), which is very wasteful of 
                      resources. Although individuals would be assessed twice 
                      in a CI scheme, they would be means-tested for taxation 
                      purposes, and a second time <i>on other criteria</i> for 
                      the purposes of the benefit, i.e. citizenship. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      social assistance part of the UK's Social Security system 
                      has a history of basing benefits on worth or desert. The 
                      distinction between deserving and undeserving poor was often 
                      used to determine eligibility, for instance, by examining 
                      the causes of lone parenthood, and it is still enshrined 
                      in the willingness-to-work and job-seeking tests of today. 
                      Worth is a very subjective basis for eligibility, and it 
                      is difficult to define and monitor, so a universal system 
                      should be cheaper to administer.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3) 
                      <i>Is a CI method of administration likely to be cheaper 
                      than NIT or TC systems?</i> </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      method of administration must define not only the basis 
                      for eligibility, and include a mechanism for identifying 
                      and monitoring those who qualify, as discussed in 2) above, 
                      but it must also provide a conduit for the delivery of the 
                      transfer payment (cf. De Wispelaere and Stirton, 2008). 
                      The physical conduit for the transfer could be a direct 
                      transfer to a bank account, a cheque by post, cash obtained 
                      by presenting a Pension book or Child Benefit book at one 
                      of several designated offices, or cash collected in person 
                      at a specified time and place. The method will also determine 
                      the frequency and amount of information that has to be supplied 
                      by the recipient. This latter is mainly determined by selectivity 
                      criteria. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      CIT's definition of CI refers only to the preference for 
                      paying a regular gross benefit rather than a NIT or TC. 
                      One reason for this is that a CI is more likely than deductions 
                      from tax to reach people in poverty. Another reason is administrative 
                      simplicity. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
                      the same assessments will take place, the actual number 
                      of transactions is likely to be higher in the CI method. 
                      If recipients have a choice about their preferred method 
                      of delivery of the transfer then this could add a complication 
                      for the administrators. However, NIT and TC are complicated 
                      by the involvement of employers in the tax system, by the 
                      complexities of the income tax system, and particularly 
                      by the numerous adjustments which need to be made as people 
                      move in and out of employment, move between employers, and 
                      experience other changes of circumstances. Administration 
                      of a diversity of payment methods for a CI would be less 
                      complex than the costs which changes of circumstances impose 
                      on NIT and TC calculations. Thus far, while the potential 
                      reduction in administrative costs associated with a CI scheme 
                      as defined here could produce savings, the key factor seems 
                      to be the complexity of the cases with which administrators 
                      are dealing. </font></p>

                      2005) are not specified in the definition of a CI, but many 
                      CI proposals make common assumptions about them.</font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eligibility 
                      refers to the basis on which people are included in a benefit 
                      scheme. Selectivity, or contingency, refers to the level 
                      of benefit entitlement of each person that is included. 
                      Variations in benefit levels between individuals have variously 
                      been proposed, or implemented, based on personal characteristics 
                      (gender, sexual preference, age, degree or cause of disability), 
                      association (marital status, other cohabitation, lone parenthood, 
                      multiple occupancy of a household, survivorship), activity 
                      status (willingness to work, number of hours at work per 
                      week, student, otherwise unpaid caring responsibilities

                      complexity of administrative cases increases enormously 
                      with selectivity. This is especially evident when benefit 
                      levels are based on circumstances that are ill defined and 
                      change frequently. An example is given by the present Child 
                      Tax Credit (CTC), which is a MTB system based on joint applications, 
                      bolted on to the bottom end of a tax system based on individual 
                      tax units, with the level of the benefits being dependent 
                      on a large range of circumstances, such that a multi-page 
                      form must be filled in every time that these circumstances 
                      change. This is supposed to help that part of the population 
                      which lives poverty-stricken but complicated lives where 
                      circumstances change frequently.</font></p>

                      advocates of CI schemes argue for minimal selectivity. Additional 
                      payments for individuals with disabilities are universally 
                      proposed. Variations based on age are usually acceptable, 
                      but not those based on race, gender, sexual preference, 
                      marital status, other household living arrangements, or 
                      work tests. Any proposal for a CI scheme is likely to involve 
                      minimal selectivity, and much of the complexity facing administrators 
                      will be much reduced.</font></p>

                      (1986) that it should not lead to a poverty trap, most advocates 
                      of Citizen's Income schemes would recommend a simple proportional, 
                      or mildly progressive, personal income tax on all income 
                      other than the CI. If the implementation of a CI scheme 
                      did not specify a change in the tax system, then the costs 
                      of collecting tax revenues would not necessarily change.

                      familiar in the literature. However, De Wispelaere and Stirton 
                      are right to point out that the level of the benefit will 
                      influence administration costs inversely. The more adequate 
                      the CI, the less the administration costs, because the safety 
                      net that would be required to prevent poverty, and the costs 
                      of its administration, would be reduced accordingly.</font></p>

                      residual safety net scheme would have to be set up even 
                      under a Full CI scheme, in order to cater for those people 
                      who were not eligible to be part of the CI scheme, or for 
                      those whom it was deemed were still in poverty despite receiving 
                      a CI. A social fund would be needed for those hit by emergencies, 
                      such as fires and flood; and a residual National Insurance 
                      scheme would be needed for those who would still be eligible 
                      for National Insurance benefits. It is assumed here that 
                      the administration of extra payments for people with disabilities 
                      would remain the same. </font></p>

                      at reaching those people who need it most and which also 
                      has low administration costs. Costs at 1% of the total cost

                      term 'social justice' can mean a bewildering variety of 
                      different things and can be attached as an intended outcome 
                      to a wide variety of social policies. The editors of this 
                      volume take as their guides to the meaning of 'social justice' 
                      the definition employed by the Labour Party's 1994 Commission 
                      on Social Justice: '[the] equal worth of all citizens; [an] 
                      equal right to be able to meet basic needs; [a] need to 
                      spread opportunities and life chances as widely as possible; 
                      and [a] requirement to reduce and where possible eliminate 
                      unjustified inequalities' (p.1) and John Rawls' difference 
                      principle: 'Those who wish to justify a deviation from total 
                      equality in key social and economic outcomes must demonstrate 
                      that such an arrangement will be of benefit to the least 
                      well off in society' (p.4). They judge New Labour to have 
                      failed to match policy to the Commission on Social Justice's 
                      definition, and they judge the strength of Rawls' difference 
                      principle to depend on which justifications for inequality 
                      pass his test - and this requires careful study of social 
                      policies and their outcomes.</font></p>

                      Wolff suggests that political philosophers should develop

                      theories of social justice David Piachaud and Ruth Lister 
                      draw conclusions relating to inequality in past, present 
                      and future society. Will Kymlicka suggests that we can both 
                      recognise cultural diversity and sustain a redistributive 
                      welfare state; Iris Marion Young asks that we rebalance 
                      the diversity/equality debate towards equal opportunities; 
                      Ruth Lister asks that respectful treatment and genuine voice 
                      should accompany redistribution; Christopher Bertram asks 
                      for global social justice; Harry Brighouse and Adam Swift 
                      recognise that parents must be partial towards their own 
                      children and suggests that social policy should promote 
                      equality of relationship and other goods; and David Gordon 
                      points out that scandalously little has been written on 
                      social justice for children. Katie Schmuecker discusses 
                      diversity and equity across the UK now that government is 
                      increasingly devolved; Tania Burchardt applies Amartya Sen's 
                      capability approach (an approach to equality based on the 
                      distribution of substantive freedom) to inequality in Britain; 
                      Gary Craig finds ethnic minorities to be unjustly treated; 
                      and Maria Abedowale asks us to integrate social justice

                      with all collections of essays based on seminar series, 
                      there is a certain amount of overlap between the essays, 
                      and the chapters' agendas are often driven more by the authors' 
                      interests than by the editors' stated aims ( - some chapters 
                      don't explicitly ask how theories of social justice relate 
                      to social policy). But many students, teachers and researchers 
                      will find this a valuable collection, not least because 
                      it demands to be followed up in particular policy areas. 
                      For instance: there is no chapter on the social justice 
                      theories underlying different ways of organising tax and 
                      benefit structures - a gap which we hope the Citizen's Income

                      considerable role to play in maximising welfare and social

                      (p.2) and it applies 'debates, theories and methods from 
                      moral philosophy to contemporary ethical issues relating

                      1 recommends 'social humanism' (with the human roots of 
                      ethics not disconnected from religion and nature) as a foundation 
                      for ethical theory; chapter 2 studies consequentialism (the 
                      theory that it is outcomes that matter); chapter 3 explores 
                      Kant's very different ethics (leading the author to principles 
                      which guide our choice of action); chapter 4 discusses Aristotle's 
                      'virtue' ethics (which is about the kind of people we are 
                      and how we should live); and chapter 5 provides three principles 
                      on which the rest of the book is based: common sense, humanism,

                      our social freedoms such that eradicating all instances 
                      of the former also threatens the latter' (p.114); chapter 
                      7 asks that choice be conceptualised in terms of equity; 
                      and chapter 8 argues that financial contributions to public 
                      services should be either compulsory and indirect or discretionary 
                      and direct and that, in general, government should relate 
                      to families by 'maintaining appropriate social environments 
                      and welfare systems' (p.157). Along the way practical policy 
                      issues are discussed: the legalisation of drugs, schools 
                      admission policies, and the care of the elderly.</font></p>

                      and chapter 10 on euthanasia ( - in which Fitzpatrick proposes

                      between ethical theory and practical social policy, and 
                      it shows how 'applied ethics directs our attention to many

                      welfare state is characterised by 'competition, the expansion 
                      of internal markets, and target-setting' and for the 'customer' 
                      by 'choice, opportunity, activation, and individual engagement' 
                      (p.v). Underlying these trends is a conceptual framework 
                      which understands the citizen as an individual rational 
                      maximiser. The message of the book is simple: social citizenship 
                      and the welfare state rely on a conceptual framework characterised 
                      by reciprocity, inclusion and trust: characteristics at 
                      the opposite ends of spectra from the competition and rational 
                      choice which characterise today's welfare provision. If 
                      current trends continue then we might find ourselves discarding 
                      the social citizenship on which any welfare state must depend.</font></p>

                      first chapter defines 'social citizenship' as the 'rights 
                      and duties associated with the provision of benefits and 
                      services designed to meet social needs and enhance capabilities, 
                      and also to guarantee the resources necessary to finance 
                      them' (pp.4,5) and discusses redistribution both vertically 
                      (between members of a society) and horizontally (across 
                      the individual's lifecycle) as the practical basis for reciprocity 
                      and inclusion. The chapter also discusses uncertainty as 
                      the problem which the welfare state addresses, and trust 
                      in the welfare system as essential to the contract between 
                      citizen and government. The author lists challenges facing 
                      the welfare state: technological change in industry, the 
                      rise of the service sector, a loss of working class cohesion, 
                      an ageing population, changes in family structure, the changing 
                      role of women in society and employment, and, in chapter 
                      2, globalization, which results in increased competition 
                      in goods and services, more flexible labour markets, growing 
                      inequality, growing downward pressures on tax revenues, 
                      and mobile populations, capital and revenue. Government 
                      response in the UK, as well as in Europe more generally, 
                      is to promote a 'transition to a new more individualized 
                      welfare state citizenship' (p.31) and in particular an active 
                      casework approach to unemployment benefits.</font></p>

                      chapters ask how rational individual choice can be integrated 
                      with social norms and institutions and how the emerging 
                      new configuration will affect social citizenship. The author 
                      finds that reciprocity is valued as much by the new 'active 
                      citizen' as it was in the previous 'passive benefits' phase 
                      of the welfare state, but that 'the rational actor welfare 
                      state will struggle to secure trust and inclusion' (p.106) 
                      and that this will make sustaining the welfare state problematic.

                      next three chapters take the UK's National Health Service 
                      as a detailed case study and asks how new policies have 
                      impacted on social citizenship: 'The reform programme has 
                      been most successful in areas which correspond to the needs 
                      of the mass of the population, the broad field of reciprocity. 
                      It is less impressive in relation to the more intractable

                      is strong on a rather defensive reciprocity amongst the 
                      better off and that it is weak on inclusion and thus does 
                      little to tackle inequality. The author finally suggests 
                      that 'sustaining the values that underlie [the welfare state] 
                      requires political determination to enhance competitiveness 
                      by reducing the privileges of advantaged groups and extending 
                      the inclusion of the weakest and to rebuild public trust 
                      by extending democratic engagement in social provision'

                      will be David Piachaud's chapter 'The restructuring of redistribution' 
                      in which he studies how 'the impact of government through 
                      benefits and taxes on the distribution of net money incomes 
                      has changed since 1997' (p.199). He discusses such changes 
                      as tax credits and rightly decides that the redistributive 
                      effects of both taxation and social security need to be 
                      studied together. He discusses the decrease in the number 
                      of people facing marginal deduction rates of over 70% and 
                      the increase in the number facing marginal deduction rates 
                      of over 60%, and he compares the redistributive effectiveness 
                      of the system now with that in 1997 by comparing the numbers 
                      taken out of poverty by the tax and benefits systems both 
                      today and then. He concludes that restructuring since 1997 
                      has been effective but that there is still a long way to 
                      go - and that now 'the entire system is mightily confused' 
                      and 'many more now gain very little from extra earnings

                      has more to do with theoretical outcomes than with why so

                      for repayment of overpayments which weren't their fault,

                      faring well of individuals in society. Of course, this isn't 
                      all there is to be said about welfare, but it is an important 
                      perspective because it enables the activities of the private

                      For if it is true that welfare and work are intimately related 
                      (and the evidence suggests that they are) then the application

                      Real Economy is in Good Shape The good news is that the 
                      real global economy remains in good shape with all the potential 
                      it needs to flourish and grow. Its supply side factories, 
                      offices, shops, restaurants, transport and communications 
                      systems are capable of high productivity output. Its 6bn 
                      consumers are ready to continue growing consumption demand 
                      - in the majority of cases to raise low standards of living. 
                      But it's the financial sector whose turmoil now threatens 
                      the real economy that it is designed to serve - a classical 
                      case of the tail wagging the dog, of the speedometer trying 
                      to drive the car, of the virtual world controlling the real 
                      world. We know from Keynes that monetised aggregate demand 
                      has to be sufficient in purchasing power to consume the 
                      potential output of the supply side of the real economy. 
                      Since there is no problem in delivering real output, why 
                      should it be difficult to fund adequate demand?</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 
                      the various components of macroeconomic demand, the current 
                      problem is with consumer expenditure and its funding from 
                      wages, pensions, dividends and credit. As productivity increases 
                      in an advanced technology economy, the wage component of 
                      aggregate demand will decrease, leading to an increased 
                      dependence on credit to fund real demand to consume the 
                      available output. Until very recently this has worked. The 
                      fact that the last decade has been the <i>NI</i>CE, <i>non 
                      inflationary</i>, decade demonstrates that exactly the right 
                      amount of credit has been fed into the economy to fund consumer 
                      demand - there has been sufficient output, and growth has 
                      been stable. The problem now is that this surge in consumer 
                      credit demands repayment out of wages which are as insufficient 
                      for this as they were for the initial purchasing power required 
                      in the economy.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
                      can be done? Public and private sector investment increases 
                      have only a medium term effect, so for immediate effect, 
                      consumer spending has to be re-funded by interest rate cuts, 
                      tax cuts, or fresh credit. But the only form of consumer 
                      credit which will sustain the same long term NICE economy 
                      is credit which does not have to be repaid since this would 
                      reduce disposable wage income in a future period. In a future 
                      world where total automation made goods and services available 
                      with very few workers and therefore ever decreasing disposable 
                      income from wages, some such form of allocation of the product 
                      would be necessary. Money <i>can</i> be created - banks 
                      already lend multiples of what they have on deposit. The 
                      Citizen's Income, for which some have long campaigned, might 
                      be the instrument needed. Wealthy Middle East oil rich states 
                      with small populations have necessarily developed such citizen 
                      income allocations and Japan is currently making a similar 
                      income distribution. A Citizen's Income might now have an 
                      equally necessary role in the economies of the developed 
                      industrial world.</font></p>
