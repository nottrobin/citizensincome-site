                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      Big Society is a society of personal autonomy: of choice 
                      over family structure, labour market activity, and much 
                      else. It is a society in which incentive translates into 
                      success and in which rights mean responsibility.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Small 
                      government is government which doesn't interfere in people's 
                      family structures, in their labour market activity, or in 
                      anything else much.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our 
                      means-tested and complex tax and benefits system is riddled 
                      with rigidities and disincentives that deny us the choice 
                      which the Big Society promises; and it embodies the kind 
                      of interference in family structure and labour market behaviour 
                      which big government is all about. The coalition partners 
                      have said in their <i>Programme for Government</i>: 'We 
                      will investigate how to simplify the benefit system in order 
                      to improve incentives to work'; and the Government's consultation 
                      paper on the future of the benefits system, <i>21st Century 
                      Welfare</i> (<a href="http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/21st-century-welfare.pdf">http://www.dwp.gov.uk/docs/21st-century-welfare.pdf</a>), 
                      recommends a 'Universal Credit' as the way to do that:</font></p>
                    <blockquote> 
                      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                        family's gross entitlement would depend on their circumstances. 
                        Entitlements would be based on current benefit and Tax 
                        Credit rules, with amounts for individuals, couples, children, 
                        housing, disability or caring. The total would then be 
                        reduced for earnings and other income to produce the net 
                        amount payable. The credit would be payable to the household 
                        member making the application. &#133;. Such a structure 
                        would remove much of the complexity that burdens the system 
                        today. Crucially it would also create the platform for 
                        tackling the current problems of high Marginal Deduction 
                        Rates and low gains to work through reform of earnings 
                        disregards and tapers. (p.19)</font></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      Universal Credit would be a step in the right direction: 
                      but we suggest that the kind of major reform which the Big 
                      Society requires should encompass both the benefits and 
                      the income tax systems, because if tax allowances were changed 
                      from allowances to cash payments of the same value, and 
                      if only minor changes were made to the Universal Credit, 
                      then a Citizen's Income would be the result: an unconditional, 
                      nonwithdrawable income for every citizen. Such a Citizen's 
                      Income would provide all of the advantages of a Universal 
                      Credit along with substantial increases in simplicity and 
                      efficiency (particularly in relation to transitions between 
                      different labour market statuses); and, because a Citizen's 
                      Income would take the individual and not the household as 
                      its basis, it would free both households and the employment 
                      market from significant rigidities and complexities. In 
                      terms of the Big Society agenda, a Citizen's Income would 
                      incentivize enterprise, promote family structure and labour 
                      market choice, create the possibility of small government, 
                      and provide the foundation for the Big Society, in ways 
                      in which the Universal Credit would fail to do. </font></p>

                      rise towards the right hand side of each graph. This is 
                      because for the purpose of the project we have removed the

                      and where a new Upper Earnings Limit should be established. 
                      If there is no Upper Earnings Limit then the revised scheme 
                      will save money. If a low Upper Earnings Limit were to be 
                      established then the scheme would cost money. Somewhere 
                      along the gross earnings range there will be an Upper Earnings 
                      Limit which will enable the revised scheme to break even.

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By 
                      replacing tax credits with a Citizen's Income, and by making 
                      a few other minor changes, the tax and benefits system can 
                      be amended to increase employment incentives across substantial 
                      earnings ranges for a variety of household types.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                      hope that by offering this indicative scheme we shall encourage 
                      research into further options: into their effects on net 
                      income for different family types; into their consequences 
                      for labour market behaviour; and into their redistributive 
                      characteristics. The scheme studied here increases substantially 
                      the net income of employed couples with children across 
                      part of the income range, so either additional funding would 
                      be required (somewhat unlikely in the current economic climate) 
                      or significant redistribution would need to be acceptable. 
                      There might be feasible schemes which would offer the virtues 
                      of the scheme discussed here at the same time as increasing 
                      net income for all house-hold types by lower amounts, and 
                      there might be feas-ible schemes which would fulfil our 
                      criteria and which would save money. Such schemes would 
                      clearly be of interest to a Government attempting to reduce 
                      costs. </font></p>

                      is now required is a great deal more research on different 
                      household types and on a wide variety of different Citizen's 
                      Income schemes. Of particular interest would be the net 
                      income effects on non-earning households as they make the 
                      transition from unemployment into part-time or full-time

                      It would give pensioners an additional &pound;25 a week

                      recent research reported in <b>Social Policy and Administration</b> 
                      Peter Taylor-Gooby and Rose Martin show that in Germany 
                      and the UK different social security regimes result in real 
                      differences in perception: 'the analysis shows that while 
                      respondents in both countries value equality of opportunity 
                      as a normative principle, those in Germany are much more 
                      likely to argue that an equal opportunity approach requires 
                      government to guarantee equal access to basic services. 
                      They are also more likely to express concerns about market 
                      freedoms which allow those who can afford it better access 
                      to health care and education. Real differences in welfare 
                      values remain, loosely following differences of regime type,

                      to relieve old age poverty; Lloyd George's 1908 Old Age

                      12 is entitled 'Learning from the Past' and sets out from 
                      the important statistic that the current basic state pension 
                      is worth less today as a percentage of average earnings 
                      than it was when the first old age state pension at 5s (25p) 
                      per week was paid to the first pensioners on the 1st January 
                      1909. It also sets out from the question as to the extent 
                      to which it is the state's role to ensure adequate social 
                      pension provision for the elderly (p.173).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      authors express concern that 40% of current pensioners could 
                      qualify for the means-tested Pension Credit, that this percentage 
                      could increase, and that up to 1.8m pensioners who could 
                      claim Pension Credit don't do so because of 'the complexity 
                      of the claiming process and the stigma associated with being 
                      dependent on state benefit' (p.178). As for current rates, 
                      the basic state contributory pension provides an income 
                      of below 16% of average earnings (p.178). The authors are 
                      also disturbed by the increasing income gap between pensioners 
                      with private pensions funded by contributions on which tax 
                      relief has been granted, and pensioners reliant on means-tested 
                      Pension Credit. To provide a universal pension at the same 
                      rate as the threshold for means-testing would cost only 
                      one third of the cost of tax relief on private pension contributions.</font></p>

                      authors believe that 'the basic state pension &#133;.. should 
                      continue to be the bedrock of pension policy' (p.183) and 
                      they discuss the feasibility of providing a universal basic 
                      state pension. Such a universal and unconditional pension 
                      would mean that pensioners would retain the benefit of their

                      I of this evidence-based approach to labour market exclusion 
                      reports on case studies in labour market discrimination 
                      and inequalities. As we read these reports of qualitative 
                      and quantitative research amongst discriminated-against 
                      groups and in disadvantaged communities, a consistent message 
                      emerges: active labour market projects simply designed to 
                      get people into employment as quickly as possible serve 
                      neither the economy nor clients' long term interests. What's 
                      needed are better entry-level jobs and solutions to structural 
                      inequality and discrimination in employment. Transition-focused 
                      approaches lead to just that: brief transitions into the 
                      labour market. A broader approach which promotes individuals' 
                      autonomy and capabilities, which values their ability and 
                      right to make decisions as to whether to enter the labour 
                      market and if so how, and which removes disincentives to

                      part II some detail is added to the prescription. First 
                      comes a history of New Labour policy. In the early years, 
                      enhanced childcare provision, tax credits, and a fairly 
                      gentle 'active labour market' approach, along with improvement 
                      in economic conditions, led to a fall in unemployment. Then 
                      the fall slackened, and deindustrialised areas in particular 
                      continued to record high unemployment rates. Then sanctions 
                      increased and a target-driven approach experienced diminishing 
                      returns and a substantial transfer of claimants from Jobseekers' 
                      Allowance to Incapacity Benefit.</font></p>

                      final chapter outlines a 'capabilities and human rights 
                      approach'. 'Capabilities' are human 'functionings' within 
                      and outside the formal labour market, and they include what 
                      people <i>value</i> doing; and the rights relate to the 
                      provision of well-rewarded good work, to greater equality, 
                      and to a better work-life balance.</font></p>

                      you read this book you should start with chapter 2 and read 
                      chapter 1 last. Chapter 1 is called an 'introduction' but 
                      actually it's the 'conclusions' chapter. It really ought 
                      to have been at the end of the book.</font></p>

                      editors conclude that a top-down welfare-to-work regime 
                      exhibits diminishing returns, but that the type of employment 
                      reintegration which works is characterised by local discretion, 
                      flexibility, the ability to work outside bureaucratic structures, 
                      and 'a voluntary rather than a sanction-based relationship 
                      between project workers and service users in which power 
                      to act fundamentally rested with the latter' (p,4). Such 
                      an alternative approach is particularly needed for people 
                      for whom short-term skills enhancement currently leads to 
                      insecure low-skill employment which offers little economic 
                      improvement compared to a life on benefits.</font></p>

                      workfare approaches: 'External surveillance and sanctions, 
                      and encouragement to internal motivation and effort' (p,5). 
                      Their view is that 'genuine empowerment can only come from 
                      freely exercised choice, and .... this .... is the only 
                      realistic and socially just way of tackling labour market 
                      exclusion' (p.6). They ask for a 'human capital' approach 
                      which addresses such problems as benefit traps. <i>This</i> 
                      is the way to improve excluded groups' relationship with 
                      the labour market, not sanctions. According to the evidence, 
                      a capabilities and human rights approach works.</font></p>

                      meeting of community needs (p. 165). A Citizen's Income 
                      would also, of course, address one of the barriers to a 
                      capabilities and human rights approach: benefit traps. By 
                      reducing marginal deduction rates a Citizen's Income would 
                      make employment pay, <i>and</i> it would make it more feasible 
                      for people to decline low-wage poor-quality employment, 
                      thus improving employment, increasing low wages, and ensuring 
                      that net incomes would increase as earned income rose.</font></p>

                      1 outlines our current economic, social and political crisis. 
                      The dominant theme under both Conservative and New Labour 
                      governments has been 'the deliberate extension of market 
                      forces into all aspects of social life' (p.24), and the 
                      authors outline the 'social malaise' which has been the 
                      result. Two of the subheadings say it all: 'New Labour: 
                      Consumer Thatcherism' (p.54) and 'What on earth is to be 
                      done?' (p.63). The editors' answer is 'a sustainable post-capitalist 
                      world' (p.65) which takes the danger of climate change seriously 
                      and is characterised by a combination of 'social equality 
                      and human solidarity' and by 'positive freedom and democratic

                      of the current work-income nexus and a Citizen's Income

                      balance tilted more towards time for collective, private 
                      and public activities, a renewed democracy, the NHS, schools 
                      as places of genuine education, and reducing the demand 
                      for energy (which is consistent with a post-consumerist 
                      work-life balance). All of the detailed chapters, except 
                      for that on the NHS, recommend practical policy aimed at

                      the current 'ephemeral quarrels and personal clashes'). 
                      The undermining of the feminist critique by a superficial 
                      empowerment of women is lamented, hope is located in the

                      (ch.2) finds increasing complexity in healthcare systems 
                      in Britain, Germany and the USA. The basic characters of 
                      the different systems haven't changed, but increasing diversity 
                      within each system is leading all of them towards greater 
                      hybridity. Hippe (ch.3) finds a similar process occurring 
                      in pension provision, thus supporting 'the hybridisation 
                      hypothesis, which predicts convergence towards mixed regulatory 
                      frameworks based on market mechanisms that stress individual 
                      responsibility as well towards social policy structures 
                      that promote collective responsibility' (p.64). Dingeldey 
                      (ch.4) finds that the promotion of employability is central 
                      to the labour market policies of Denmark, the UK and Germany, 
                      and that therefore state intervention in this field is increasing 
                      rather than decreasing. Martens and Jakobi (ch.5) study 
                      the OECD's contribution to the formation of education policy 
                      in its member countries and conclude that the organisation's 
                      impact is now considerable, and they take this finding as 
                      an indicator of the growing influence of such international 
                      organisations. Starke and Obinger (ch.6) find that, in many 
                      of the same countries, welfare states are converging in 
                      relation to a number of indicators: not in a 'race to the 
                      bottom', as some have suggested, but more often in an 'upwards' 
                      convergence. </font></p>

                      the first section of the book employs research on particular

                      second part reverses the process, and asks about the impact 
                      of the processes identified on particular policy areas: 
                      health, pensions, the labour market, and education.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An 
                      interesting point about Gerlinger's discussion of changes 
                      in health insurance systems in Germany, Switzerland and 
                      the Netherlands (ch.7) is that the UK couldn't have been 
                      compared in the same way because the universal NHS avoids 
                      the need for state regulation of health care insurance. 
                      It might have been worth mentioning this. Bonoli's chapter 
                      (ch.8) on trade union involvement in pension reform in Sweden, 
                      France, Switzerland, Italy and Germany contains an important 
                      lesson for policy-makers: that system change requires deep 
                      involvement by such stakeholders. In chapter 9 Cox studies 
                      labour market reform in a variety of countries and finds 
                      that, where new ideas have been persuasively championed 
                      by political parties, coherent reform has taken place; but 
                      that where political parties have resisted change, the outcome 
                      has been policy drift. In this latter case the result will 
                      be that the inevitable adjustment to new ideas will lead 
                      to more public discord than it might otherwise have done. 
                      Klitgaard finds that greater knowledge of other countries' 
                      educational policies and their outcomes is causing considerable 
                      convergence between different countries' education policies.</font></p>

                      editors offer a final concluding chapter which draws together 
                      the conclusions of the different chapters into a picture 
                      of continuing diversity within which a few trends are identifiable, 
                      and in particular 'a withdrawal of the state from service 
                      provision and a simultaneous extension of the state's responsibilities 
                      for guaranteeing the delivery of an access to services' 
                      (p.250).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                      draw another conclusion. A five page discussion of the Netherlands 
                      pension system (pp.52-7) gives four lines to the residence-based 
                      flat-rate Citizen's Pension and five pages to the funded 
                      industry-based sector. The internal governance of Britain's 
                      NHS is discussed but not its universal provision, which 
                      really ought to have been compared with insurance-based 
                      healthcare systems. The UK's Child Benefit doesn't get a 
                      mention, even where it would have been highly relevant (e.g., 
                      pp.75-7). The editors and authors clearly regard universal 
                      provision as not worth discussing, yet it has been a highly 
                      successful welfare system in its own right. It has low administrative 
                      costs, it doesn't contribute to labour market inflexibilities 
                      and disincentives, and it doesn't disincentivise saving 
                      for old age. So here is a hypothesis: Universal provision 
                      is so successful when implemented that it creates no problems. 
                      It is problems, not successes, which demand the attention 
                      of policymakers and academics, so universal provision drops 
                      off the policy agenda and therefore isn't considered as 
                      an option when welfare reform options are discussed.</font></p>

                      poverty can be prevented; chapter 2 discusses the challenges

                      3 offers lessons from the past sixty years: the universal 
                      NHS remains popular, targeted social housing isn't, and 
                      the NHS serves poverty reduction far more successfully than 
                      social housing does. The authors show that benefits policy 
                      has shifted towards means-testing and thus towards negative 
                      public assessment of people receiving benefits. </font></p>

                      allocating on the basis of need isn't the best way to help 
                      people in need. Preventing poverty 'is not about how we

                      the design is wrong, then the evolutionary path will be 
                      wrong, and only a redesign of the system can correct that.

                      welfare provision, and chapter 6 takes the lessons learnt 
                      during that and previous chapters and recommends universalism 
                      and integration as the guiding principles for welfare system 
                      design. In the housing field the authors recommend full 
                      dispersal and integration of social housing, bringing housing 
                      assistance into a single system, and a spectrum of funding 
                      methods between ownership and non-ownership. </font></p>

                      tax and benefits they recommend turning tax allowances into 
                      a flat-rate tax credit and then making it payable to all, 
                      thus creating a Citizen's Income (which the authors call 
                      a Basic Income). It is the third step in their plan which 
                      then poses a problem, for they recommend that the credit 
                      be paid on a household basis (p.163). This was suggested 
                      by Steven Webb in Samuel Britten and Steven Webb, <i>Beyond 
                      the Welfare State: An Examination of Basic Incomes in a 
                      Market Economy</i> (David Hume Institute, 1990). It was 
                      a mistake then, and it would be a mistake now. Quite apart 
                      from the fact that a household basis would lose the administrative 
                      simplicity of a Citizen's Income paid to each individual, 
                      we know that people prefer income tax to be calculated on 
                      the basis of the individual and so Horton and Gregory's 
                      own criterion of public acceptability requires an individual-based 
                      Citizen's Income and prohibits a household tax credit. In 
                      addition, the household's employment pattern choices would 
                      be improved by an individual-based Citizen's Income, so 
                      in this respect too an individual-based Citizen's Income 
                      would prevent poverty more effectively than a household 
                      benefit. Any government which decides to implement the report's 
                      suggestions therefore needs to stop at the individualised 
                      Citizen's Income and not transfer it to a household basis. 
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Similarly, 
                      the authors' suggestion of a participation income also needs 
                      to be resisted. The casework approach required by this policy 
                      would render it socially unacceptable, which on its own 
                      would suggest that the authors ought to have resisted the 
                      idea. Also, the money saved by refusing the benefit to a 
                      tiny proportion of the population would be far less than 
                      the additional administrative costs of monitoring everyone. 
                      The authors correctly recognise the NHS to be a primary 
                      model for welfare policy because its unconditionality results 
                      in positive public assessment of those it serves and of 
                      the service itself. The same would be true of a Citizen's 
                      Income, and for the same reason. </font></p>

                      report's final chapter asks for a new welfare contract based 
                      on reciprocity. Here again, the authors haven't quite learnt 
                      their own lessons. If the NHS is the public's favourite 
                      part of the welfare state ( - and Child Benefit would, I 
                      suspect, run it a close second, or even beat it into first 
                      place), then it is universality, and not reciprocity, which 
                      generates public approval and so ought to be the basis of 
                      any new welfare contract.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
                      is certainly time for a redesign, and this report contains 
                      everything necessary for doing that. Now we need a second 
                      edition which doesn't draw back from the lessons learnt 
                      during the first few chapters. The evidence points towards 
                      a welfare state founded on universal provision, with reciprocity 
                      a consequence of universality and not as the system's hallmark. 
                      The evidence points towards a Citizen's Income: universal, 
                      unconditional, and paid to each individual - not to households.

                      and the Commission on Social Justice of 1994 but fails to

                      a Citizen's income as a possible future reform and perhaps 
                      accidentally expresses an important inconsistency which 
                      too frequently characterises debate of this option: 'There 
                      would be no direct disincentive to work and/or save, as 
                      individuals would keep the basic income even if they earned 
                      or saved large sums of money. However, it is argued that 
                      if basic income payments were set at a level to cover people's 
                      needs there might be no incentive for people to work at 
                      all' (p.145). Again, in relation to options for the future, 
                      it's a pity that neither the Pensions Commission's recommendation

                      modelling, and for over twenty years Holly Sutherland has 
                      been deeply involved in the development of tax-benefit models. 
                      It is a remarkable story of persistence and hard work in 
                      an important cause: the discovery of the effects of current 
                      and proposed tax and benefits systems, not just in the aggregate, 
                      but for individual households; and not just in theory but 
                      in relation to how money is actually earned and spent in 
                      the real world.</font></p>

                      immediate reason for the publication under review is the 
                      extension of the tax-benefit modelling software EUROMOD 
                      from a model built to handle the tax-benefit systems and 
                      datasets for the fifteen countries which constituted the 
                      European Union until 2004 into a version which can handle 
                      the systems and datasets of nineteen countries and soon 
                      of all twenty-seven of the current member states. Given 
                      the complexities of the twenty-seven different systems involved, 
                      and the added complexity of different datasets available 
                      for each member state, this is really quite a remarkable 
                      achievement. Those of us who were impressed at the way in 
                      which the early POLIMOD could process the UK's Family Expenditure 
                      Survey data to tell us the difference which a change in 
                      a benefit level or in the structure of the benefits system 
                      would make to actual net earnings in a particular earnings 
                      decile can only marvel at software which will soon do that 
                      and more for all twenty-seven EU countries. </font></p>

                      to get back to the book: The first two historical chapters 
                      close with plans for the future which include the use of 
                      a Eurostat dataset rather than household surveys differently 
                      organised in different countries, and further expansion 
                      of the number of countries around the world which are now 
                      using modelling software based on EUROMOD's structure. Then 
                      follow chapters which employ EUROMOD to study the effects 
                      of current tax-benefit systems on net incomes in nineteen 
                      EU countries, the effects which proposed flat tax schemes 
                      would have in Estonia, Hungary and Slovenia (the costs of 
                      the changes would be borne by lower income groups), the 
                      effects of alternative tax-benefit proposals on child poverty 
                      in Poland, the effects of reforming child allowances in 
                      Lithuania, and the effects of replacing in-work benefits 
                      with a revenue-equivalent tax-free labour income. (This 
                      chapter takes into account the likely effects of the current 
                      and proposed systems on labour market participation and 
                      finds that a tax-free labour income would increase labour 
                      market participation.)</font></p>

                      investment which tax-benefit models represent should be 
                      maximised by making them as accessible as possible to a 
                      wide range of users. We can only agree.</font></p>

                      policy makers often divide people into categories: one set 
                      of policies and rules for children, another for working 
                      age adults, and another for the elderly. Evans and Williams 
                      take a rather different 'lifetime' approach, asking how 
                      different policy regimes since the 1970s treat people's 
                      entire lifecycles. To do this they take us to a theoretical 
                      world in which the rules of a particular decade's policies 
                      remain constant for an entire lifetime. The sets of policies 
                      and regulations they choose are those in force in January 
                      1979 (Old Labour), April 1997 (Thatcherism) and December 
                      2008 (New Labour). The authors restrict themselves to policies 
                      which directly influence income, and they achieve accessibility 
                      in a complex field by studying five hypothetical families: 
                      the Nunns (no employed), the Lowes (50% of median earnings), 
                      the Meades (median full-time earners in 1979, 1997 and 2008), 
                      the Moores (twice median earnings), and the Evan-Moores 
                      (very high earners). </font></p>

                      introductory chapters on how the welfare state and the economy 
                      have changed during the past thirty years, each of the main 
                      chapters takes one section of the lifecycle (childhood, 
                      working age - here four chapters tackle different policy 
                      areas - and old age) and asks how the three different sets 
                      of rules would affect different hypothetical families. A 
                      chapter on aggregate outcomes of the three different sets

                      Opportunities and Incentives Simulation (LOIS) computer 
                      model. The final chapters use the model to show how the 
                      three different policy sets would affect the hypothetical 
                      families across their lifetimes rather than just during

                      book is packed with detailed results ( - particularly interesting 
                      is the material on the effective marginal deduction rates 
                      and the attendant work incentives which the different family 
                      types experience under different policy regimes); and the 
                      concluding chapter is equally packed with important detail, 
                      and particularly the finding that taxation has become more 
                      regressive. The authors' more general conclusion is that 
                      the Meades are in much the same position as before; the 
                      Moores have done 'very nicely, thank you' (p.312); and the 
                      Lowes experienced serious losses between 1979 and 1997, 
                      a partial recovery by 2008, and 'are now more firmly locked 
                      into low-income lifetimes than they were in 1979 due to 
                      a combination of risk and policy response' (p.314). A higher 
                      risk of employment interruption and of means-tested benefits 
                      not keeping up with average earnings means a worsening position

                      is one verdict which I think we must question: 'If a policy 
                      lasts the term of a government unchanged it is unusual' 
                      (p.3). This is surely not true of income maintenance policy. 
                      Since the Elizabethan Poor Law we have divided people into 
                      categories to which we have allocated different income maintenance 
                      regimes; and since the Beveridge Report in 1942 income maintenance 
                      strategy has been based on insurance benefits, means-tested 
                      benefits (including tax credits), and a universal benefit 
                      for children (originally Family Allowance, now Child Benefit). 
                      The names have changed and the regulations have changed, 
                      but the structure hasn't changed.</font></p>

                      risk suggests new structures for sharing risk, and social 
                      policy must respond accordingly' (p.315). The structures 
                      haven't changed for nearly seventy years. Perhaps it's time 
                      they did.<br>

                      the 'Blair legacy' of welfare reform constitutes a coherent 
                      'modernisation' strategy across the different parts of the 
                      welfare state. The editor's early verdict is that 'the term 
                      ['modernisation'] is rarely or poorly defined by government 
                      or commentators, and it appears to have many different meanings, 
                      which results in no generally accepted definition' (p.3). 
                      This verdict is borne out by the final chapter's careful

                      a threefold understanding of policymaking: goals (overall 
                      aims of policy-makers), techniques (how things are to be 
                      done), and settings (e.g., the level of a budget). First 
                      order change (in settings) happens all the time, second 
                      order change (of settings and techniques) happens frequently, 
                      but third order change (of goals, techniques and settings) 
                      constitutes a paradigm shift and happens only rarely. Each 
                      of the chapter authors asks whether paradigm shift has occurred, 
                      and in health, housing, social security, social care, education, 
                      criminal justice, risk, private welfare, choice, and conditionality 
                      paradigm shifts are discovered (see table 15.3 on p.266).

                      1909 the Poor Law Commission reported. A majority report 
                      recommended services tailored to specific needs: sheltered 
                      housing for the elderly, a welfare to work scheme for people 
                      of working age, services for children, and generally a casework 
                      approach to poverty amelioration with voluntary organisations 
                      as major providers. This is very much the way the welfare 
                      state went during the first half of the twentieth century 
                      and in which it is now going again.</font></p>

                      Webb's minority report argued that poverty had structural 
                      causes and was not the fault of the poor, so what was required 
                      was poverty <i>prevention</i>, not poverty amelioration 
                      - and to do this a 'national minimum' was required: a national 
                      minimum wage, and a national system of benefits for those 
                      out of work to replace the locally organised Poor Law. The 
                      Webbs (for the concept of the 'national minimum' was Sidney's 
                      as much as Beatrice's) argued for services which didn't 
                      discriminate between the poor and the non-poor, as only 
                      <i>universal</i> education and health care could prevent 
                      the conditions for a permanent pauper class.</font></p>

                      the Second World War and which underpinned the welfare state 
                      during most of the second half of the twentieth century.</font></p>

                      Fabian Society is to be congratulated on marking the centenary 
                      of the minority report. The Webbs were early and influential 
                      Fabians, so it is the minority report which is here celebrated; 
                      but Nick Bosanquet, a cousin by marriage of Helen Bosanquet, 
                      who contributed substantially to the majority report, not 
                      only defends the majority report as appropriate to its time, 
                      but also shows how it remains relevant. Sunder Katwala, 
                      General Secretary of the Fabian Society, shows in his introduction 
                      how it is often personal connections which influence policy 
                      change (Beveridge worked as a researcher on the minority

                      minority report ('From the workhouse to welfare'), Roy Hattersley 
                      suggests that equality is a necessary condition for freedom,

                      workhouse, Jon Trickett relates how in 1905 Poor Law Guardians 
                      refused help to families during a lock-out in West Yorkshire, 
                      Dianne Hayter suggests that today's policy-makers could 
                      learn from the way in which Beatrice Webb combined the roles 
                      of researcher and campaigner, Jose Harris asks why the Webbs 
                      didn't have the impact in their time that their researcher 
                      William Beveridge had in his, Seema Malhotva discusses the 
                      role of other Fabian women in fighting poverty, and Peter 
                      Townsend applies the Webbs' methods to today's global poverty. 
                      The book closes with a study guide, adverts for Fabian Society 
                      publications, an application form for joining the Society, 
                      and a direct debit form. This is all as it should be.</font></p>

                      debate and of its short- and long-term outcomes. One outcome

                      history of social policy is more of a winding country lane, 
                      with poorly-signposted crossroads, than a majestic motorway. 
                      Iain Duncan Smith's proposed radical welfare reforms, announced 
                      on May 27, were very much in this tradition. But they conceal 
                      the germs of an important innovation.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
                      all, the social insurance principle was a stratagem by the 
                      anti-democratic German Chancellor, Otto Von Bismarck, to 
                      stymie the liberal opposition; and Lloyd George's embryonic 
                      welfare state schemes of 1910 were opposed by trade unions 
                      and friendly societies. Duncan Smith's proposals are a mixture 
                      between increased conditionality and cuts, and the first 
                      step towards a truly progressive integration of the tax-benefits 
                      system.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                      an interview in the <i>New Statesman</i> on 29 October last 
                      year, the controversial political philosopher, Slavoj &#142;i&#158;ek, 
                      referred to the idea of universal basic incomes (unconditional 
                      sums for all citizens) as the only new idea from the Left, 
                      but one which was doomed as 'the last desperate attempt 
                      to make capitalism work for socialist ends'. Now it seems 
                      that he was looking in the wrong direction; the economic 
                      crisis has led the Conservatives towards this idea as the 
                      technical fix for systems failures in means-tested benefits, 
                      the poverty and unemployment traps.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Duncan 
                      Smith's plan, outlined in a report by his Centre for Social 
                      Justice in September last year, is to merge the present 
                      complex conditions of elegibility for these benefits into 
                      just two elements, and to ensure that they are withdrawn 
                      consecutively rather than simultaneously. Together with 
                      allowing claimants to keep a far larger proportion of their 
                      earnings for work of less than 16 hours per week, this would 
                      create a smooth withdrawal rate of 55 per cent as earnings 
                      rise, and greatly improve incentives to take 'entry jobs' 
                      in fragmented labour markets.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
                      first sight, this has nothing to do with the grand principle 
                      of ending means-testing which has informed the basic income 
                      approach, and in the Duncan Smith version it is combined 
                      with increased, not diminished, work enforcement. Worse 
                      still, it is based on household, not individual entitlement. 
                      Yet the decision to administer all benefits for poor people 
                      of working age as parts of the tax system would be a necessary 
                      first step to any basic income scheme, and one that no previous 
                      government has been willing to take.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Advocates 
                      of basic income have tended to approach the issues as ones 
                      of political freedom and equality - as allowing all citizens 
                      to enter labour markets and household arrangements on the 
                      same (independent) basis. For this reason the idea has recently 
                      appealed to Old Marxists like Andr&eacute; Gorz, to analytical 
                      socialists like Philippe Van Parijs, and to feminists like 
                      Carole Pateman, as well as to liberals like Brian Barry. 
                      The only parliamentary manifesto which contained its endorsement 
                      was that of the Greens' Caroline Lucas.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All 
                      of these expected progress to basic income to proceed along 
                      the highway of 'decommodification', via an enlightened awareness 
                      of the demands of justice in co-operation for the common 
                      good, and for the future of the planet. Instead, the motives 
                      for this crucial reform are far more closely related to 
                      the analyses by the High Tory, Hermione Parker.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She 
                      focused on the self-defeating features of the interactions 
                      between the onset of taxation and the withdrawal of benefits, 
                      which were only partly mitigated by tax credits. Duncan 
                      Smith's measures would fit squarely in her tradition, even 
                      if they violate the principles of the purists.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
                      it seems to me to be only partly because of the manifest 
                      perversities of the current system that the time for this 
                      idea has come. The vision of the Big Society, which was 
                      the only new idea for the future on offer at the election, 
                      depends on mass participation in a wide range of local, 
                      associational, mutual and co-operative activities.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
                      they stood, the benefit rules would have kept all claimants 
                      out of any part in these developments, which would in turn 
                      have scuppered any prospects for them to be included in 
                      the drive to mend 'Broken Britain'. Duncan Smith's scheme 
                      would mean that they could join in, as part-time paid workers 
                      or as volunteers.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                      may go some way to mitigating the disappointment of basic 
                      income advocates that tax-benefit integration should arrive 
                      by this ignominious route. They can also console themselves 
                      with the thought that this foundation can be used to develop 
                      more liberal, unconditional superstructures, and that at 
                      least it proves that the idea was not as 'utopian' as &#142;i&#158;ek 
                      (and many others) have supposed.</font></p>
