                      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                        Labour's current policy review, I'll be arguing that universal 
                        benefits have an important role to play at every stage 
                        of the life course. Reinstating universal child benefit 
                        at the same rate for every child, and supporting the creation 
                        of a universal pension - based on participation, not just 
                        financial contribution - should form the bedrock of our 
                        approach. And more universalism should be accompanied 
                        by a more progressive tax system, building on the 50p 
                        top tax rate.</font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                      welcome the fact that in the Labour Party there is now open 
                      debate about the future direction of tax and benefits policy.

                      particularly welcome the fact that a policy suggestion from 
                      the Government doesn't generate an automatic objection from 
                      the Opposition. Steven Webb, as Minister of State for Pensions, 
                      has proposed a universal pension. It is a pleasure to see 
                      the idea espoused by a Labour member of the Work and Pensions 
                      Select Committee. We are also of course pleased to see Kate 
                      Green calling for Child Benefit to remain universal. This 
                      is currently <i>not</i> Government policy, but we hope that 
                      it soon will be again. </font></p>

                      we now require is open debate, both in the Coalition Government 
                      and in the Labour Party, of reforms to follow the establishment 
                      of the Universal Credit. To individualise the Universal 
                      Credit would individualise and simplify the whole tax and 
                      benefits system. To remove the taper, at the same time as 
                      turning Income Tax allowances into cash payments, would 
                      give us a Citizen's Income, and the administrative simplicity 
                      and employment incentives which would be the result. </font><br>

                      the moment, more than &euro;1 trillion flows into the more 
                      or less state-controlled German welfare complex every year. 
                      Representing one third of German GDP, this vast amount of 
                      money covers every social benefit, from child allowance 
                      to health insurance. If the economic stats were not striking 
                      enough, of the 80 million people living in Germany only 
                      40 per cent earn a wage. So a large proportion of the population 
                      is dependent either partially or wholly upon the state.

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
                      the German welfare state does not just provide a financial 
                      safety net. It also seeks to regulate the behaviour of benefits 
                      claimants through various forms of lifestyle intervention, 
                      such as dictating how much claimants should be allowed to 
                      spend on cigarettes. In this regard, the so-called Hartz 
                      IV legislation, passed in 2005 by the then ruling Green-Social 
                      Democrat coalition, is important. Named after its originator, 
                      Peter Hartz - then a social democratic trade unionist and 
                      manager of part state-owned Volkswagen before being imprisoned 
                      for embezzlement in 2007 - Hartz IV effectively revised 
                      the status of the unemployed. They were no longer citizens

                      welfare dependent. They were no longer people fallen on 
                      hard times, but fully capable of getting back into work: 
                      they were psychologically dependent upon welfare and incapable 
                      of getting back into work. </font></p>

                      IV not only produced a new form of state dependency; it 
                      also sought to prepare these damaged citizens for work. 
                      To this end, a new sector of senseless and unproductive 
                      labour for about 1.5 million of the unemployed benefits 
                      claimants was created (thus removing them from unemployment 
                      statistics). Under the pretext of empowering the unemployed 
                      by psychologically preparing them for the labour market, 
                      these benefits claimants are forced into absurd and degrading 
                      activities run by highly subsidised companies with Orwellian-sounding 
                      names like <i>Neue Arbeit</i> [New Work]. One example of 
                      this absurd work-for-work's-sake philosophy is the Toys 
                      Company. In more than 60 factories around Germany, the formerly 
                      unemployed people work for an extra &euro;1 per hour on 
                      top of their out-of-work benefits, recycling second-hand 
                      toys for poor children. One task is to check the completeness 
                      of second-hand puzzles. 'The record for completing the 5000-piece 
                      puzzle is just 10 days', explained Toys Company's manager, 
                      'although unfortunately we found out that three pieces were 
                      missing'. G&ouml;tz Werner and Adrienne Goehler refer to 
                      this example in their new book <i>1000 &euro; f&uuml;r Jeden. 
                      Freiheit. Gleichheit. Grundeinkommen</i>. (&euro;1000 Each. 
                      Liberty. Equality. Basic Income.) They argue for a new model 
                      of state welfare distribution which would replace the bureaucratic, 
                      behaviour-management regime of Hartz IV with one based on 
                      a simple premise: the state would pay everyone a basic income.

                      first sight their central idea of a basic income for everybody 
                      seems quite charming: Every citizen gets &euro;1,000 from 
                      the state every month from cradle to grave. As Werner, the 
                      billionaire founder of a drugstore chain, and Goehler, president 
                      of the Hamburg Art Academy, note, &euro;1000 represents 
                      more than just a living wage. They argue that it also enables 
                      people to participate in the cultural life of society. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because 
                      this would be an amount that every person would be legally 
                      entitled to, there would be no more degrading means tests 
                      and interventions in the lives of benefits claimants. The 
                      welfare bureaucracy as Germans know it would be redundant: 
                      the unemployed would be freed from doing compulsory labour 
                      promoted by the state, and the rest of society would be 
                      freed from the imperative of wage labour provided by the 
                      market. Income would be separated from work. As one would 
                      not need to sell one's labour in order to guarantee an income, 
                      the authors argue, people could choose their line of work, 
                      for whom they want to work and for how long. This would 
                      lead to a new society in which self-realisation, creativity 
                      and compassion replace the existential fears created by 
                      the current rat race. </font></p>

                      German political class is partially sympathetic to the idea 
                      of a basic income. Hence, with the exception of the Social 
                      Democratic Party (plus trade unions), all parties represented 
                      in parliament have been discussing various models of basic 
                      income at some point in the past few years. For instance, 
                      in its party programme, the liberal Free Democratic Party 
                      calls for a <i>B&uuml;rgergeld</i> (Citizen's Income), an 
                      amount paid out whenever necessary but low enough to maintain 
                      the incentive to work. Elsewhere, the Greens call for a 
                      <i>Bedarfsorientiere Grundsicherung</i> (needs-based basic 
                      provision), and even within the conservative Christian Democrat 
                      Party there is support for a <i>Solidiarisches B&uuml;rgergeld</i> 
                      (solidarity citizen's income). </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&#133; 
                      Support for the idea [also] comes from the German middle 
                      class. Campaign groups with names like 'Freedom Instead 
                      of Full Employment' and 'Federal Agency of Income' have 
                      emerged, advertising their ideas on various websites, in 
                      films and at events and demonstrations. It is important 
                      to note that support for a basic income does not come from 
                      unemployed and poorly educated low-wage employees. It comes 
                      from privileged and educated young professionals with middle-class 
                      backgrounds who, working in poorly-paid, insecure positions 
                      in the media and cultural sector, hope for an unconditional 
                      basic income to make their lives that little bit more secure. 
                      This is no struggle for abundance for all. For these metropolitan 
                      types, a basic income promises security, opportunities for 
                      self-realisation and psychological well-being. </font></p>

                      is to the fears and prejudices of this post-material milieu 
                      that the book <i>&euro;1000 Each</i> speaks. In this way, 
                      the book exemplifies the rampant social pessimism so prominent 
                      in contemporary Western societies. The authors describe 
                      the insecure working conditions of the 'creative class', 
                      surviving on short-term contracts and project work, as the 
                      future for a society that has given up on the goal of well-paid 
                      and meaningful work for everyone. According to the authors, 
                      only a minority of people will earn their money in secure, 
                      long-term work. The rest of us will be left to the fate 
                      currently endured by the creative class, the 'vanguard of 
                      precarious conditions'. </font></p>

                      to American sociologist Jeremy Rifkin's 1995 book <i>The 
                      End of Work</i>, Werner and Goehler argue that the advance 
                      of globalisation, automation and rationalisation has led 
                      to a post-industrial society in which production can no 
                      longer serve as the basis of societal wealth. Economic growth, 
                      they assert, 'is a dead duck'. Instead, Werner and Goehler 
                      urge us to focus on creativity as 'the only remaining, sustainably 
                      exploitable resource of the twenty-first century'. This 
                      is why they argue for a basic income. Because to tap into 
                      this resource of creativity, while avoiding the social unrest 
                      that will come with the shortage of constant, paid work, 
                      requires everyone to be accorded a level of material security.

                      well the constraints all governments face when contemplating 
                      radical welfare reform. Universal Credit will strengthen 
                      financial work incentives for some, as intended, but weaken 
                      them for others. In general, incentives to work will be 
                      strengthened for the main earner in a family who works part-time 
                      or has low earnings, and will be weakened for those with 
                      higher earnings and for second earners in couples. Marginal 
                      effective tax rates will tend to fall for those on lower 
                      earnings, and rise for those on higher earnings, although 
                      this pattern also depends on how many earners there are 
                      in the family. The reform will also lead to both winners 
                      and, in the long run, losers. Because of the way the parameters 
                      of Universal Credit have been set, couples, and particularly 
                      those with children, look set to gain by more, on average, 
                      than single-adult families, particularly lone parents, who 
                      will lose on average according to our analysis. But, in 
                      general, the impact on incomes is progressive, with the 
                      bottom income deciles gaining the most as a fraction of

                      find that 'the NMW is associated with a significant fall

                      has been negative in recent years. NMW effects on hours 
                      have been mixed, but overall there is no compelling evidence

                      his religious belief, as well as actively promoting a Citizen's 
                      Income in any arena available to him. In 1989 he was a founder 
                      trustee of the Basic Income Research Group, which became

                      standard definition of a Citizen's Income is that it should 
                      be paid for by levying tax on the incomes of workers. It 
                      was unease with this aspect of Basic or Citizen's Income 
                      that led Kevin (and me) to become involved in monetary reform. 
                      If the state reclaimed the money-creating power from commercial 
                      banks, then the proceeds could be used to fund a small Basic 
                      Income. Monetary reform used to be the preserve of cranks 
                      (and sometimes bigots as well), but it has now become urgent 
                      and mainstream following the banking crash of 2008. An important 
                      forum for the monetary reform debate is the Christian Council 
                      for Monetary Justice, of which Kevin was a long term supporter.</font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
                      support its campaign on the global extension of social security, 
                      in 2008 the International Labour Organisation (ILO) undertook 
                      a study of 126 research reports on tax-financed social transfer 
                      programmes (STs) operating worldwide. 62 programmes from 
                      30 developing countries were analysed. These STs reach between 
                      300 and 350 million beneficiaries - children, working adults, 
                      and elderly people - and represent a considerable proportion 
                      of the world's poor. The results are available through the 
                      ILO's online <i>Matrix on the effects of social transfers</i> 
                      (2009). <font size="1">3</font> STs have emerged as a core 
                      component of poverty reduction strategies supported by international 
                      organisations such as the World Bank and a number of UN 
                      institutions. Thus their impact merits considerable interest.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                      article outlines the current knowledge on the effects of 
                      STs in a way relevant to those interested in Citizen's Income 
                      (CI). STs are not unlike CIs. They are non-contributory 
                      and tax-financed, and a considerable number of STs are unconditional 
                      and universal (across certain groups). The ILO study shows 
                      positive impacts of STs on a range of areas of human existence. 
                      The study therefore enables us to predict the kinds of effects 
                      that a CI could deliver in low and middle income countries.

                      ILO's matrix was developed to support decision-making within 
                      ministries of planning and finance, mainly in developing 
                      countries. By ordering the unintended and intended effects 
                      of tax-financed STs in developing countries in relation 
                      to human development goals and the anti-poverty agenda, 
                      the matrix helps to inform national policy makers about 
                      the outcomes that could be realistically expected from STs 
                      and to guide investment in social security systems. Likewise, 
                      all those interested in CI might utilise the findings of 
                      the matrix to guide their arguments on the CI proposal.</font></p>

                      are documented. Programmes had a generally positive effect, 
                      <font size="1">4</font> evidenced by the significantly higher 
                      scores in the 'clear positive effect' column for all but 
                      five of the sub-dimensions. Those sub-dimensions where the

                      in terms of enhancing human development, supporting the 
                      full utilisation of productive capacity, enhancing and stabilising 
                      consumption, and facilitating social cohesion and inclusion.</font></p>

                      study shows that STs exhibit positive impacts on poverty, 
                      health and nutrition, the social status of recipients (notably 
                      women), economic activity and entrepreneurial small scale 
                      investments (notably in agriculture), and have avoided significant 
                      adverse effects on labour market participation of the poor 
                      populations which they serve. The studies also show that 
                      many families used part of the cash transfer to invest in 
                      small-scale agricultural activities, including the purchase 
                      of livestock. However, in the areas of adult preventative 
                      health, reduction in the worst forms of child labour, employability, 
                      reduction of labour market informality, and social capital 
                      and solidarity, the effect of STs is less obvious, either 
                      because there is no actual effect or because of limited 
                      research on the subject. </font></p>

                      can be used to support some aspects of the CI proposal. 
                      However, before the repercussions for a CI are discussed 
                      in detail, we need to explore a number of important caveats 
                      and knowledge gaps. </font></p>

                        may have a lot more to say about people's well-being than

                      far this article has cautiously suggested that the findings 
                      in the ILO matrix study augur well for CI, by indicating 
                      that it too can be expected to deliver a number of similarly 
                      positive effects. However, the message perhaps ought to 
                      be a little more mixed and nuanced, because the table better 
                      supports unconditional and universal transfers for children 
                      and the elderly (a CI for the young and the old) than for 
                      working age adults. A significant number of the STs that 
                      focus on active population groups are conditional and targeted 
                      (based on behaviour and income/wealth) and therefore one 
                      might suppose that their effects will be related to their 
                      conditional and targeted mechanisms. </font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      findings on the effects of STs on children and pensions 
                      suggest that a CI could have similarly positive effects. 
                      It is possible to make this conclusion because a significant 
                      number of the STs for these two vulnerable groups were unconditional 
                      or universal across these groups and are therefore similar 
                      to a CI. The social pensions evaluated were not based on 
                      previous activity or earnings and are therefore essentially 
                      a Citizen's Pension. Similarly, the South African Child 
                      Support Grant, which is unconditional, has encouraged human 
                      capital formation of the young and their future earnings 
                      (Ag&uuml;ero et al, 2007, p. 19). We could expect a CI to 
                      do the same for children. The results of social pensions 
                      and a number of other unconditional transfers support the 
                      expectation that a CI could generate similarly positive 
                      social and micro-economic effects.</font></p>

                      from the pilot CI in Namibia, there are no studies on the 
                      impact of a CI on active population groups, simply because, 
                      with the exception of the Alaskan Permanent Fund, there 
                      is no fully-fledged CI that actually covers active population 
                      groups.<font size="1"> 5 </font> Secondly, the STs analysed 
                      in the ILO study differ from a CI because they are conditional. 
                      <font size="1">6 </font>It is therefore difficult to maintain 
                      with any certainty that the effect of a CI would be the 
                      same as for conditional and targeted STs. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having 
                      said that, the findings of the Namibian pilot scheme do 
                      permit us an insight into how the active population group 
                      might react. For instance, according to the evaluation of 
                      this pilot, productive capacity of the active population 
                      group rose and economic activity rose, especially among 
                      women. In addition, own account work saw the largest increase, 
                      and particularly the tending of vegetable plots and the 
                      building of latrines, both of which increased the community's 
                      health. The pilot scheme also seemed to stimulate more micro-economic 
                      activity, with new shops opening. These findings are important 
                      as they provide evidence that a CI does not act as a disincentive 
                      in the labour market (see Basic Income Grant Coalition, 
                      2009; Torry, 2009). This is of great significance, as the 
                      argument that a CI would act as a disincentive to productive 
                      activity tends to be one of the biggest concerns of policy 
                      makers and governments with regard to STs for the active 
                      population. Having said this, one must also be cautious 
                      about using the Namibian pilot scheme as absolutely conclusive 
                      evidence on the potential effect of a CI on the active population 
                      because of obvious limitations in terms of replicating an 
                      actual fully-fledged society-wide CI.</font></p>

                      key impediment to using the table to support CI revolves 
                      around whether it is the conditional nature of many of the 
                      STs that is pivotal in producing the positive results they 
                      have delivered. Does conditionality make the difference? 
                      If conditionality is <i>not</i> the overriding factor, then 
                      perhaps we can conclude that the unconditional and universal 
                      nature of a CI could deliver results similar to those documented 
                      in the ILO matrix. There is not space here to discuss this 
                      debate in full, but suffice to say that the precise role 
                      played by conditionality in delivering positive outcomes 
                      is not clear. As the author of this article and the ILO 
                      have argued elsewhere, it is problematic to argue that conditionality 
                      is pivotal in producing the outcomes generated by STs (see 
                      ILO, 2010a).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      similarly ambivalent conclusion on the role of conditionality 
                      is made by Gabel and Kamerman, who state that researchers 
                      have not been able to attribute with absolute certainty 
                      the causality between effect and the conditional mechanism, 
                      because of the difficulty in disentangling the effects of 
                      the policy from other elements (e.g., the state of the labour 
                      market) (2008, p.18). One suspects that the motivation for 
                      conditionality is to satisfy the 'paternalist twitch' of 
                      governments and policy makers (Standing, 2002: 208) and 
                      public thirst for satisfying the social ethic of reciprocity. 
                      There is therefore plenty of scope for arguing that a CI 
                      could deliver similar outcomes in the absence of conditionalities.

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
                      is not clear that conditionality is crucial in achieving 
                      certain human development goals or for producing the positive 
                      effects that have been identified in the ILO matrix, so 
                      the study can be used to support a CI, provided caveats 
                      and limitations accompany any such argument. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
                      the findings of the matrix definitely support are those 
                      conditional programmes which many see as precursors to a 
                      society-wide CI. For example: in Brazil, Senator Eduardo 
                      Suplicy, a key proponent of CI, has argued that the <i>Bolsa 
                      Familia</i> ST is a first step towards a CI (2006). This 
                      is because the behavioural demands synonymous with the receipt 
                      of cash from conditional STs are easier to sell to the public 
                      and political class than is a CI. The greater political 
                      acceptability synonymous with conditional <font size="1">7</font> 
                      STs could help to cultivate a political and public culture 
                      more receptive to STs and, therefore, to a CI at a later 
                      stage. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Just 
                      as significant as the results of the matrix study are those 
                      of the pilot CI in Namibia which has demonstrated positive 
                      results similar to those documented in the ILO matrix table 
                      across an entire community, including the active population. 
                      Particularly significant are the positive effects on labour 
                      market participation and productive capacity. The linking 
                      of the matrix and the findings of the Namibian case study 
                      can bridge the 'unknown' empirical dimension in the ILO 
                      study; given that hitherto no society-wide CI has really 
                      existed. Combining the results of the table and the Namibian 
                      case study justifies the expectation that a CI could produce 
                      similar effects to STs for the active population.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, 
                      the current preference amongst governments and major international 
                      institutions (e.g. the World Bank) seems to be shifting 
                      toward conditionality, and this poses some concerns for 
                      those proposing universal and unconditional cash transfers. 
                      The political prospects of a CI would be better if the trend 
                      were against conditionality.</font></p>

                      conclusion: The ILO matrix confirms what many have suspected, 
                      that STs have a number of positive micro-economic and social 
                      effects. The matrix also offers proponents of CI reasons 
                      to feel optimistic that it too could produce similarly positive 
                      results. </font></p>

                      And this differs from the standard proposed version of a

                      followers of the Basic Income movement will be most interested 
                      in the inside accounts of how the Alaska Dividend was created 
                      and became the sound and solidly supported programme that 
                      exists today. Although the Alaska Permanent Fund (APF) is 
                      the source of revenue for the Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD), 
                      many non-Alaskans are unaware that the two are different 
                      programmemes created at different times by different kinds 
                      of legislation.</font></p>

                      events leading up to the creation of the fund began in 1955 
                      when Alaska called a constitutional convention in advance 
                      of statehood. The constitution that was finally adopted 
                      proclaims that all of the natural resources of Alaska belong 
                      to the state for the benefit of the people. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
                      of the most important events which led to the development 
                      of the fund and dividend happened quietly in an office in 
                      Juneau in 1963. At that time, negotiations with the federal 
                      government over which lands would be transferred to full 
                      state ownership and which would remain federally owned had 
                      dragged on for several years. A geologist named Tom Marshall 
                      (according to Hammond) and/or the commissioner of natural 
                      resources, Phil Holdsworth (according to Rose), persuaded 
                      then-governor Bill Egan that there might be oil in far-northern 
                      Alaska. Egan then finished the land negotiations with the 
                      federal government by agreeing to take a 'large, barren 
                      and unpopulated wasteland on Alaska's Arctic Slope, near 
                      remote Prudhoe Bay.' In 1967, oil was discovered under that 
                      barren, unpopulated wasteland.</font></p>

                      Hammond was elected governor in 1974, when, he says, 'the 
                      scent of anticipated oil revenues wafted like musk in the 
                      halls of the state legislature'. Hammond was possessed with 
                      the idea of putting as much of that money as possible into 
                      a permanent fund that would pay dividends to Alaskans. The 
                      concept had been with him for a long time. Years earlier, 
                      as mayor of the small municipality of Bristol Bay Borough, 
                      he had tried unsuccessfully to create a similar programme 
                      at the local level using fisheries revenue. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hammond 
                      had many reasons for favouring the fund and dividend. He 
                      thought that the temporary windfall should be saved rather 
                      than spent as it came in. He was afraid that the government 
                      would waste the windfall on poorly designed programmes or 
                      projects that would benefit only special interests or favored 
                      constituents. He wanted to make sure that every Alaskan 
                      would benefit from their jointly owned oil resources. And 
                      he hoped the dividend would help the poor.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
                      reading his book and speaking to him at the 2005 USBIG Congress, 
                      I still cannot say for sure how this idea came to Hammond 
                      and how he came to be so obsessed by it. He appears to have 
                      been influenced by the guaranteed income movement of the 
                      1960s, but this does not fully explain where he got the 
                      idea for a state-owned fund paying dividends to all citizens.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
                      Hammond was not the only person responsible for the creation 
                      of the fund and dividend, it is clear that it would not 
                      have happened without his single-minded pursuit of it for 
                      his entire eight years as governor. He made it his top priority. 
                      It was the object seemingly of every budget compromise he 
                      made from 1974 to 1982. The Alaska Dividend therefore owes 
                      its existence to the right person being in the right office 
                      at the right time. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      time was right not only because money was beginning to flow, 
                      but also because of public perception. Five years before 
                      he took office, in 1969, the state government had received 
                      an initial windfall of $900 million (six times the size 
                      of the state budget at that time) from the sale of leases 
                      for the right to drill. Some people at the time, including 
                      then-governor Keith Miller, argued that the state should 
                      invest the money and spend only the interest. But by 1974 
                      all of that money was gone, and there was a widespread (if 
                      exaggerated) belief that most of it had been wasted. There 
                      was thus strong support for saving at least part of the 
                      expected oil windfall when Hammond began discussing the 
                      idea of a fund and a dividend with the legislature.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      1976, after a series of compromises, Alaskans passed an 
                      amendment to the state constitution dedicating at least 
                      25 percent of each year's oil royalties to the new APF. 
                      It was a fraction of what Hammond wanted. Although he discussed 
                      many different figures, he at one time had hopes of dedicating 
                      <i>50 percent</i> of all oil revenue to the fund. Royalties 
                      make up only about half of the state's oil revenues. Therefore, 
                      the APF is only one-fourth as large has Hammond had wanted. 
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      biggest missing piece, from Hammond's perspective, was the 
                      dividend. There is no mention of it in the amendment, which 
                      simply states that at least a minimum amount of certain 
                      kinds of mineral revenue would go into a fund of 'income 
                      producing investments.' It did not specify what these investments 
                      should be or how the returns would be used. Although these 
                      omissions were a disappointment to Hammond, according to 
                      Rose, the vagueness of the APF amendment was instrumental 
                      to its passage. It drew support from diverse groups, not 
                      all of whom would have supported a more clearly defined 
                      plan dedicating the returns to a dividend or anything else.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 
                      both Rose's and Hammond's accounts, the dividend proposal 
                      was not popular with the public or with members of the legislature 
                      when Hammond started pushing for it in the late 1970s. The 
                      dividend got through thanks both to the strength of the 
                      governor's office and to a long series of compromises made 
                      by a few dedicated legislators. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After 
                      a court challenge about how dividends were to be distributed, 
                      the final version of the dividend bill was passed and went 
                      into effect in 1982. It dedicated roughly half of the APF's 
                      returns to the PFD. Unlike the fund itself, the dividend 
                      is not protected by a constitutional amendment. It is created 
                      by a simple majority vote of the state legislature. It is 
                      protected today, mostly, by its enormous popularity. According 
                      to Rose, a legislator proposed to do away with the PFD only 
                      six months after the first dividends went out. Rose writes, 
                      'His proposal had ample support in the Legislature, but 
                      when the public heard about it, everyone ran for cover.' 
                      After just one dividend cheque, the PFD had a strong political 
                      constituency. After three or four cheques, it became politically 
                      inviolable.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
                      the fund was still not fully secure from diversion. The 
                      principal only had to be held in 'income producing investments.' 
                      There are many risky, politically motivated projects that 
                      can count as income producing investments. Many politicians 
                      wanted to use it for subsidized loans or infrastructure 
                      projects. Some wanted to restrict the APF to invest only 
                      in Alaskan assets. The legislature still has the power to 
                      intervene on any of these issues, but for the most part 
                      they have not. These issues have been resolved largely by 
                      the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation (APFC), a body that 
                      was created in 1980 to manage the fund and dividend.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">David 
                      Rose became the first executive director of the APFC in 
                      1982. He made it his goal to follow the 'prudent investor 
                      rule,' a legal doctrine in which those who invest on behalf 
                      of others must seek the highest returns consistent with 
                      the safety of the investment. Investments with almost any 
                      other political goal are ruled out by the prudent investor 
                      rule, because they tend not to be the safest and most profitable. 
                      This rule was nominally established in APF legislation in 
                      1980, but the law has few teeth. It takes the self-discipline 
                      of the managers and the oversight of public opinion to keep 
                      it in place. The state set up other programmes for subsidized 
                      loans and development projects. By the time Rose left office 
                      in 1992, the prudent investor rule was well established 
                      in precedent. The Alaskan public, wary that some bureaucrat 
                      might be blowing the source of their future dividends, paid 
                      close attention to the fund's performance. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even 
                      Rose felt the temptation to use the fund for political objectives. 
                      He tells one story from the late 1980s when the manager 
                      of Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund came to him privately 
                      and suggested that the Kuwait fund, the APF, and two pension 
                      funds from the lower forty-eight states, should pool their 
                      assets and buy a controlling interest in British Petroleum 
                      (BP). Rose turned it down, of course, but not without some 
                      hesitation and daydreaming. It would have been a political 
                      move - not the move of a prudent investor.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These 
                      two books together lay out the long series of events between 
                      1955 to 1992 that led to the APF being established in the 
                      Alaskan state constitution; the PFD being established by 
                      law; the prudent investor rule being established by law 
                      and precedent; and all being protected by public opinion. 
                      At the time of writing (January 2011), the APF is at more 
                      than $38.4 billion. The most recent annual PFD (October 
                      2010) was $1,281 for every man, woman, and child in Alaska.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      dividend is safe for now because it continues to be one 
                      of the most popular programmes in Alaska, but that might 
                      not be true forever. The legislature has recently made several 
                      attempts to redirect the principal of the fund toward political 
                      projects, such as infrastructure investments, which show 
                      reduced commitment to the prudent investor rule. Alaskans 
                      were surprisingly resigned to the $12 billion the fund lost 
                      in the financial crisis of 2008-2009.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Furthermore, 
                      Alaska faces difficult budgetary times ahead thanks to decisions 
                      made when the oil started flowing. Back then, when Hammond 
                      was trying to create the dividend, he reluctantly and regretfully 
                      signed a bill to eliminate the state income tax. Looking 
                      at short-term effects only, the elimination of the income 
                      tax seemed like a great idea. The state simply didn't need 
                      the tax, and it was making far more money in oil revenue 
                      than it needed to run the state budget. Hammond thought 
                      it would be much better to dedicate more oil revenues to 
                      the permanent fund and continue to finance most government 
                      spending through regular taxes. Eliminating the income tax 
                      would benefit Alaskans unevenly and temporarily. Dedicating 
                      an equal amount of additional money to the APF (and an accompanying 
                      dividend) would benefit all Alaskans permanently. Instead 
                      the state decided to live off temporary oil revenue.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today 
                      nearly 85% of the Alaskan state budget is funded by oil. 
                      When those revenues run out there will be enormous pressure 
                      to redirect the PFD, and perhaps even APF principal, toward 
                      supporting the state budget. Furthermore, the state will 
                      be in the position of needing to find new tax sources just 
                      when the industry that dominates the state economy will 
                      be contracting. Perhaps natural gas will create a new resource 
                      boom just as the oil money begins to run out. Perhaps some 
                      other part of the Alaskan economy will take over. But it 
                      is clear that Alaska is in a more precarious position than 
                      it would have been if the state had saved more of its oil 
                      revenues. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It's 
                      tempting to think what might have been if Alaska had saved 
                      all of its oil revenue in a best-case scenario. Suppose 
                      the state had kept the income tax, put all its oil revenues 
                      into the APF, and spent only the interest. The APF would 
                      now be something in the neighborhood of eight-to-ten times 
                      its actual current size of $38.4 billion. For a best-case 
                      scenario, say $400 billion. Most financial analysts agree 
                      that one can withdraw up to 4% or 5% per year from an investment 
                      fund and still expect it to grow over time in real terms. 
                      Suppose the state was able to withdraw 5% each year, using 
                      half of it for dividends and half for the state's operating 
                      budget. That would produce a dividend of $15,000 per person 
                      per year and $10 billion for the state budget. Current total 
                      state spending is only $10.5 billion per year. Thus, the 
                      state would only need to raise $0.5 billion from other sources 
                      this year, and it would be able to envisage the day when 
                      returns to the fund financed the entire state budget.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Enticing, 
                      but it is a best-case scenario, relying on the most optimistic 
                      assumptions on every issue. It ignores all of the financial 
                      risks and political, economic, and demographic barriers 
                      to maintaining such a system. It also ignores the fact that 
                      the state needed to spend some of the oil money as soon 
                      as it came in. It was a poor state with weak infrastructure 
                      and poor schools: it no longer is - thanks to the oil boom. 
                      Although some of the oil money was wasted, some of it was 
                      well spent. As Rose argues, 'Until basic needs are met, 
                      such as education and public safety, the government has 
                      no business saving for the future.' Alaska had to spend 
                      a lot to meet its needs at the time, but it could have saved 
                      much more than it has. If Hammond had got his way, the fund 
                      and dividend would be four times the size they are now.</font></p>

                      that the book is for students and their teachers, but because 
                      it constantly draws connections between social science theory

                      and public choice theory inform our understanding of Thatcherism's 
                      quasi-markets; feminism has changed the position of the 
                      public-private divide and thus our treatment of domestic

                      comprehensive education to niche-marketing academies; Foucault 
                      has uncovered the disciplinary networks which now influence 
                      many areas of our lives; and the idea of 'social construction' 
                      tells us where 'the underclass' comes from - to mention 
                      just a few of the many connections to be found in the book.

                      social justice; and these too are related to practical social 
                      issues: mental health, the relationship between social security

                      teacher, and the clarity of expression and organisation 
                      of the material have clearly benefited from her teaching 
                      experience. The final chapter on social movements similarly 
                      reflects Lister's constant engagement with social policy 
                      issues through her involvement in organisations, through 
                      her speaking at conferences, and through her articles and

                      personal approach and perhaps should have included an account 
                      of issues she faced while at the Child Poverty Action Group.

                      Ulrich's preface suggests that if Switzerland is to experience 
                      a society of citizens then it needs more equal incomes and 
                      more permeable social class boundaries. Increasing automation 
                      and the demands of sustainability will between them mean 
                      that not everyone will be employed full-time, so a Citizen's 
                      Income will be needed to provide for the necessary more 
                      equal incomes and to enable everyone to be employed part-time. 
                      Ulrich recommends that 25% of Swiss GDP (the same proportion 
                      as is spent on income maintenance in Switzerland today) 
                      should be spent on providing every Swiss citizen with a 
                      Citizen's Income of 1,500 SFr Citizen's Income. Higher taxes 
                      would make a Citizen's Income of 2,500 SFr per month possible.

                      Dommen-Meade's introduction to the book summarises the chapters 
                      and links their discussions into an argument for a Swiss 
                      Citizen's Income's feasibility. Then come three chapters 
                      arguing for the feasibility of a Citizen's Income in Switzerland: 
                      Bernard Kundig's insightful study of long-term changes in 
                      the economy and in Swiss society leads into an argument 
                      for a Citizen's Income funded by an increase in consumption 
                      taxes and flat income tax; Albert J&ouml;rriman suggests 
                      a mechanism which would result in the employed giving back 
                      an amount equal to the Citizen's Income, and he suggests 
                      how provision for unemployment and disability might relate 
                      to a Citizen's Income; and both Kundig and J&ouml;rriman 
                      suggest that a Citizen's Income of 2,500 SFr per month should 
                      be feasible. [This is approximately &pound;1,500 per month 
                      or &pound;18,000 per annum]; and J&ouml;rriman argues that 
                      a Citizen's Income of this level would not discourage paid 
                      employment and would encourage self-employment and co-operatives 
                      (p.81). Daniel Hani and Enno Schmidt argue for the same 
                      level of Citizen's Income and also argue for funding by 
                      an increase in consumption taxation, and emphasise the additional 
                      labour market choices in which a Citizen's Income would 
                      result. <br>

                      next few chapters are translations of published material 
                      about other countries. Marc de Basquiat argues for the feasibility 
                      of a Citizen's Income of &euro;12.60 per day in France; 
                      Ingmar Kumpmann and Ingrid Hohenleitner suggest a phased 
                      implementation of a Citizen's Income in Germany, so that 
                      the effects on national income can be evaluated; and Pieter 
                      le Roux argues for a Citizen's Income of R100 (about &pound;10) 
                      per week per adult. He shows that even though a consumption 
                      tax increase considered by itself would be more regressive 
                      than an income tax increase, when considered alongside the 
                      establishment of a Citizen's Income it would be <i>pro</i>gressive. 
                      The other two chapters are a translation of Anne Miller's 
                      article on minimum income standards in the third issue of 
                      the <i>Citizen's Income Newsletter</i> for 2009 and the 
                      Citizen's Income Trust's introductory booklet.<br>

                      chapters which advocate consumption taxes as a method of 
                      financing a Citizen's Income give pause for thought to those 
                      of us in the UK who have for so long assumed that reduction 
                      of income tax allowances and possibly adjustment of income 
                      tax rates would be the best method. Also of interest are 
                      discussions about the labour market effects of a Citizen's 
                      Income. If a partial Citizen's Income is likely to provide 
                      greater employment market incentives than a full Citizen's 
                      Income then it should be possible to find an optimum level 
                      of Citizen's Income, though probably only from practical 
                      experience of different levels. As Dommen-Meade suggests, 
                      the long-term effects of a Citizen's Income are more important 
                      than the short-term ones. She thinks the Swiss welfare system 
                      ripe for major change, and that a Citizen's Income is the 
                      way to do it. 'We are convinced &#133;' (p.27). <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps 
                      the most significant finding is that in every European country 
                      studied a partial Citizen's Income is found to be feasible. 
                      This raises again the question as to whether a pan-European 
                      partial Citizen's Income might be possible. Not only would 
                      this offer all of the benefits which a Citizen's Income 
                      in each country would offer, but it would also promote the 
                      efficiency of the European labour market, to the benefit 
                      of every European economy. The discussions of funding in 
                      the book suggest that such a pan-European Citizen's Income 
                      should be funded by a European consumption tax collected 
                      nationally. <br>

                      a Citizen's Income would probably require Switzerland to 
                      join the EU: but that's another discussion.<br>

                        private arrangements. Simultaneously, &#133; there is 
                        an obvious shift of responsibility back to employers and 
                        different forms of occupational welfare, back to families 
                        and their supporting role, and also back to the individual

                      second part of the book builds on Rys's previous publications 
                      on the sociological study of social security policy, and 
                      in particular discusses the ISSA's contribution to the development 
                      of a method which goes 'beyond the descriptive accounts 
                      of the institution as contained in legislative texts and 
                      [explains] why it is organised the way it is and why it 
                      functions the way it does' (p.77). Such a method contributes 
                      to policy debate by suggesting which proposals might be 
                      feasible and which not. The different components of the 
                      method are discussed: the demographic, the economic, the 
                      sociological, and the political, the study of ideas, ideologies, 
                      laws, institutions and administrative techniques, and the 
                      study of the ways in which ideas are disseminated. The method 
                      is then applied to a variety of contexts, and particularly 
                      to eastern Europe ( - Rys is Czech). <br>

                      Rys suggests in his introduction, 'it would be irresponsible,

                      and, above all, a sustained and rational argument for the 
                      importance of social insurance. However, Rys's own career 
                      investment in the development of today's systems leads him 
                      to neglect developments in which he has been rather less 
                      involved. It simply isn't true that 'no new social protection 
                      mechanism has been invented to deal with new risks and socially 
                      precarious situations' (p.1). 'Basic income', 'citizen's

                      neither do 'universal' or 'universalism'. Recent experience 
                      in Namibia suggests that universal provision might be precisely 
                      the new mechanism which the current crisis needs.<b><br>

                      Sund&eacute;n, in a chapter on retirement income security, 
                      recognises that what is good for women in the long term 
                      (e.g., longer formal labour market participation) might 
                      not be good for them in the short term - and vice versa 
                      (e.g., means-tested benefits, which can be of benefit in 
                      the short term, but which create labour market disincentives 
                      and thus be detrimental in the longer term). Fornero and 
                      Monticone identify the risks inherent in the recent transition 
                      from women being largely dependent on men's accrued pension 
                      rights to their increasingly individualised pension entitlements. 
                      Ashgar Zaidi et al discuss the surprising fact that the 
                      poverty risk for older women is 'higher in EU15 [the first 
                      fifteen European Member States] (23%) than in the new Member 
                      States (18%)' (p.99), and finds that 'flat rate universal 
                      minimum benefits have been &#133; most effective in improving 
                      women's pension incomes' (p.103). Readers of this <i>Newsletter</i> 
                      will be particularly interested in the Dutch residence-based 
                      universal state pension discussed in this chapter, especially 
                      now that Professor Steven Webb, Minister of State for Pensions, 
                      has proposed that the UK should implement a Citizen's Pension.<br>

                      special interest in the chapters on single country and comparative 
                      studies is Gould's conclusion that partial disability benefits 
                      can contribute to labour market participation and thus to 
                      income in retirement. Marin's chapter suggests that 'women 
                      are much less women than men are men - and women are much 
                      more different among themselves than they are different 
                      from men' (p.223), meaning that creating the right mix of 
                      pension provision is going to be a complex business. The 
                      overall message to emerge from this book is that pension 
                      provision is generally a highly complex matter, but that 
                      lessons can be learnt by studying both the structures and 
                      the detail of different countries' systems, and in particular 
                      the effects of those systems on women's incomes in retirement.

                      housing provision, Britain has traditionally focused on 
                      three ways of providing housing support: the provision of 
                      social housing at affordable, sub-market rents; means-tested

                      been slow. The coalition government entered power with a 
                      commitment to reducing the welfare bill. The Emergency Budget

                        costs to the public purse, because of pressure in the 
                        UK housing market and concerns that a system that allows 
                        for payment of up to 100% of unregulated private market 
                        rents creates an incentive for landlords to maximise rental 
                        return from HB claimants and a lack of incentives for 
                        HB claimants in the private sector to seek suitable accommodation 
                        and lower rents. The Government's analysis is that, without 
                        reform, expenditure is expected to rise to &pound;24bn 
                        by 2014/15. <font size="1">4</font></font></li>

                        high taper rate of HB contributes to the poverty trap 
                        and means that recipients have few incentives to find 
                        work. Housing Benefit has a taper rate of 65% which is 
                        applied to income above the applicable amount. The Housing 
                        Benefit and Council Tax benefit taper rates are additive, 
                        so the marginal deduction rate faced by a claimant in 
                        receipt of both Housing Benefit and Council Tax benefit 
                        is 85%, so net incomes rise in very small proportion to 
                        gross earnings. In his report on the future of social 
                        housing, John Hills used the example of a couple with 
                        two children, paying a rent of &pound;120 per week. In 
                        this case, the household would gain only &pound;23 a week 
                        from an increase in earnings from &pound;100 to &pound;400 
                        per week. <font size="1">5</font><br>

                      Local Housing Allowance for those receiving Housing Benefit 
                      in the private sector, have put a greater emphasis on Housing

                      and the Universal Credit</i></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Unifying 
                      current benefits for working and non-working households 
                      to create a single Universal Credit will help to simplify 
                      the system, but, critically, the focus of the Universal 
                      Credit is to improve the incentive to work by making work 
                      pay through creating a single integrated taper which will 
                      withdraw support more gradually as earnings rise. As the 
                      analysis of the white paper in the last <i>Citizen's Income 
                      Newsletter </i>made clear, the Universal Credit will provide 
                      a simplified structure designed to cover a range of needs. 
                      The credit will be an integrated working age welfare payment 
                      for a basic personal living allowance with additional elements 
                      for households with children, people with disabilities or 
                      caring responsibilities, and housing costs. As well as replacing 
                      Income Support and Income Related Employment Support Allowance, 
                      and Working and Child Tax Credits, it will also include 
                      Housing Benefit. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      White Paper states that an appropriate amount will be added 
                      to the Universal Credit to meet the cost of rent or mortgage 
                      interest. A number of supporters of greater simplification 
                      and streamlining of benefits may view this as a fudged compromise, 
                      but this addition is potentially an important commitment 
                      to retain a link between benefits and the actual rent charged 
                      to individuals. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      system that does not take into account the real costs of 
                      housing could leave existing tenants unable to keep up rent 
                      payments and leave social housing providers unable to build 
                      new homes. To date, a reliable income stream of Housing 
                      Benefits has allowed independent housing associations to 
                      secure long-term loan finance at reasonable rates that has 
                      enabled them to build affordable, social, supported and 
                      specialist homes that neither the market nor local authorities 
                      have been able build. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      actual impact of the Universal Credit on housing will only 
                      become clear as details are agreed. However, as the Universal 
                      Credit will assist mortgage interest costs as well as rents, 
                      it will help the welfare system to be more tenure neutral. 
                      However, individuals and families getting help with housing 
                      costs will have their earnings disregard reduced by a multiple 
                      of 1.5 times the eligible costs, down to the floor of minimum 
                      earning disregards for those with higher levels of housing 
                      costs. This will mean that the higher the household's housing 
                      costs the less positive the financial incentives of the 
                      scheme. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      proposals for the Universal Credit are focused on people 
                      of working age and the upper limit for the Universal Credit 
                      will be the age of eligibility for Pension Credit. However, 
                      the Government is planning to change Pension Credit to provide 
                      support for rents and to add a further element to provide 
                      income-related support for pensioners with dependent children.

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Due 
                      to the inefficiencies and structural problems within the 
                      UK housing market, dedicated support with housing to meet 
                      the real costs of rents and mortgages is needed. There are 
                      a number of possible responses that a CI might make to the 
                      Housing Benefit debate, which may be worthy of further exploration. 
                      To get the conversation started, here are three deliberately 
                      simplistic responses which in practice are not mutually 
                      exclusive:</font></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Leave 
                        it alone: Housing remains outside the CI as a payment 
                        to households rather than individuals.</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bring 
                        it together: Look at the opportunities of a CI alongside 
                        a Universal Credit which would include a simplified, tenure 
                        neutral approach to housing costs. The interaction of 
                        a Universal Credit with a CI could offer a radical simplification 
                        of housing support making the system transparent, accountable 
                        and simpler to run. This approach would lead us to look 
                        at policy approaches and delivery mechanisms that will 
                        help support this in an era where central government is 
                        keen to see more localised leadership and reduced costs, 
                        such as authorities grouping together to provide streamlined 
                        and shared benefits services.</font></li>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Look 
                        wider: Rather than asking a technical question about how 
                        approaches to specific benefits might sit together, supporters 
                        of a CI could ask what we need a housing policy to do 
                        in order to help deliver the CI's outcomes: redistribution 
                        of income, poverty reduction, clearer incentives to work 
                        and participate in society, and greater choice, control 
                        and autonomy for citizens in the housing market. This 
                        might focus on policies to improve the supply of social 
                        housing and ways to deliver more mixed communities through 
                        a variety of low cost home ownership options, as well 
                        as looking at the role of the private rented sector and 
                        asking what regulation and approach might be required.
