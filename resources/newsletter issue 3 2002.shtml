              <p><br>
                Following our suggestion in the last issue that the Citizen's 
                Income Trust might use the internet as the chief means of disseminating 
                its regular newsletter, we have received some very useful affirmative 
                and constructive comment and only one objection. This will therefore 
                be the last newsletter disseminated primarily in printed form. 
                The first issue for 2003 will be published on our website. An 
                email will be sent to everyone for whom we have an email address. 
                Anyone who asks for a print-off of the newsletter will be sent 
                one. <br>
                We would be very grateful if readers would return the form at 
                the bottom of the enclosed letter or communicate their current 
                email address by email. </p>

              <p><b>Editorial</b><br>
              </p>
              <p>This issue contains the Citizen's Income Trust's response to 
                the Labour Party's National Policy Forum's consultation document 
                A Modern Welfare State. The consultation document is important 
                because it is already the result of consultation, because it will 
                form the basis for further consultation and then for discussion 
                at a Labour Party conference, and because it asks many of the 
                right questions. Our response is the result of consultation and 
                agreement amongst the trustees of the Citizen's Income Trust. 
                In order to inform our own continuing study of the debate on the 
                feasibility and desirability of a Citizen's Income, we would welcome 
                comment on our response, and on anything else which appears in 
                the Newsletter.<br>
                In our last issue we reported on a conference held at the Institute 
                for Fiscal Studies to evaluate the current Government's effect 
                on social security provision during the past five years. On the 
                20th July a 'Socialist Conference' was held in London entitled 
                After New Labour. This was constructively critical of the Government's 
                approach to a variety of issues. Of particular relevance to readers 
                of this newsletter is Peter Townsend's paper on The Future of 
                the Welfare State. Townsend bases his approach on the Universal 
                Declaration of Human Rights, and in this context recommends an 
                extension of social insurance and a Citizen's Income, both for 
                this country and internationally. (Copies of the paper are available 
                from the editor).<br>
                But New Labour is still with us, and, we are pleased to say, still 
                strongly committed to the universal approach to benefits represented 
                by Child Benefit. (See the item on Child Benefit in the News section 
                below). By offering a careful and detailed response to the Labour 
                Party's consultation document we hope to contribute to a more 
                vigorous debate, both within the Labour Party and within the Government, 
                on the feasibility of extending this universal approach to all 
                citizens. We are encouraged by the National Federation of Pension 
                Funds recent publication (see the news item below) to believe 
                that we shall not be the only organization contributing to such 
                discussion.<br>
                There is no reason for the debate to wait until after New Labour.

              <p><b><a name="complexity"></a>A new agenda: complexity theory, 
                tax and benefits</b><br>
              </p>
              <p>This brief article sets a question: Does the rapidly developing 
                field of complexity theory offer a) a way of understanding tax 
                and benefit systems, and b) a context within which their reform 
                can fruitfully be debated ?<br>
                There is no one 'complexity theory': there are complexity theories. 
                Ilya Prigogine and Isabelle Stengers, in their Order out of Chaos: 
                man's new dialogue with nature (London: Heinemann, 1984) explores 
                the seething complexity of physical systems and discovers a wealth 
                of examples of fluctuation leading to new levels of self-organisation 
                rather than to chaos; and Gregoire Nicolis (in 'Physics of far-from-equilibrium 
                systems and self organisation', in Paul Davies (ed.), The New 
                Physics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), pp.316-347) 
                summarises one of the findings of this 'Brussels School': &quot;Nonlinear 
                dynamics and the presence of constraints maintaining the system 
                far from equilibrium will turn out to be the basic mechanisms 
                involved in the emergence of these phenomena [of self-organisation] 
                &#133; All in all, these developments contribute to the emergence 
                of a novel picture of our natural environment, more complex, more 
                realistic, and undoubtedly more challenging than the idealised 
                archetype proposed by classical science&quot; (pp.316, 346). As 
                Paul Davies points out: at the micro-level, at the macro-level, 
                and at every level in between, &quot;it is one of the universal 
                miracles of nature that huge assemblages of particles, subject 
                only to the blind forces of nature, are nevertheless capable of 
                organising themselves into patterns of cooperative activity&quot; 
                (Paul Davies, The New Physics (Cambridge: Cambridge University 
                Press, 1989), p.4), and he suggests, on the basis of evidence, 
                that systems generally undergo both self-organisation and chaos, 
                or they undergo neither.<br>
                Stuart A. Kauffman, in his The Origins of Order: Self-organisation 
                and Selection in Evolution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993), 
                concludes that living organisms are &quot;the result of the unfolding 
                of many developmental mechanisms which have become integrated 
                with one another. If our bold hypothesis is right, such integrated 
                complexity generally yields simplicity; [the process whereby viable 
                forms evolve] may be inherently robust, not exquisitely fragile&quot; 
                (p.642). <br>
                At the Complexity and Organisational Learning Research Programme 
                at the London School of Economics, Eve Mitleton-Kelly and her 
                colleagues are exploring the relevance of these developments for 
                the understanding of social systems. They take up Nicolis' and 
                Prigogine's suggestion, made in their Exploring Complexity (W.H. 
                Freeman, 1989), that &quot;it is more natural &#133;&#133; to 
                speak of complex behavior rather than complex systems&quot; (p.8), 
                and they apply it to organisational complexity. Theories of complexity 
                provide a way of seeing the world, and it is such a way of seeing 
                which has led Geoffrey M. Hodgson, in his Evolution and Institutions: 
                On Evolutionary Economics and the Evolution of Economics (Cheltenham: 
                Edward Elgar, 1999), to insist that unless the discipline of economics 
                remains diverse it will not be able to develop new usable theory 
                and &quot;will eventually suffer a dull death&quot; (p.13), and 
                to recommend that economics should experiment with methods learnt 
                from the kind of biology which Kauffman's work represents.<br>
                The theories of complexity, with their terminology of connectivity 
                and interdependence, coevolution, degrees of connectivity, fitness 
                landscapes, feedback, unpredictability and emergence, have led 
                Mitleton-Kelly to follow Kauffman in suggsesting that complex 
                systems of many kinds share a number of characteristics. We are 
                not here in the world of metaphor and analogy: we are dealing 
                with observable characteristics which systems in physics, biology 
                and the human sciences seem to have in common. The Centre at the 
                LSE thus treats organisations as complex evolving systems, and 
                bases its consultancy work on identifying and creating enabling 
                infrastructure within which experiment can lead to new order. 
                The Centre's work has shown them that complex systems cannot be 
                'designed' in great detail because they are made up of changing 
                patterns of behaviour and because within them unpredictable new 
                patterns emerge. The researchers conclude that human beings are 
                remarkably resourceful if they are allowed to self-organise.<br>
                There are some obvious lessons for tax and benefit systems:<br>
                &middot; Tax and benefit systems are themselves complex and they 
                coevolve within a complex society. We should therefore expect 
                them to exhibit properties which other complex systems exhibit.<br>
                &middot; Methods appropriate to the study and transformation of 
                other complex social systems, such as industries, are likely to 
                be applicable to tax and benefits systems as they adapt to serve 
                a changing society.<br>
                &middot; The tax and benefit systems will need to remain diverse 
                if they are to evolve creatively. This suggests (counter-intuitively) 
                that simplification of the system as a whole is what is not required, 
                and maybe that a combination of universal provision, private provision 
                and means-tested provision for each age-group is what is required. 
                <br>
                &middot; The total social system will develop most creatively 
                if it is not overcontrolled by any part or parts of the tax and 
                benefit system. This suggests that disincentives and coercion 
                should be reduced and the number of elements which might enable 
                other parts of the system to develop freely should be increased.<br>
                This short article has merely suggested an agenda. It is a large 
                agenda, but that is no reason not to make a start.<br>

              <p><b>News</b></p>
              <p>The National Association of Pension Funds recommends a Citizen's 
                Pension of &pound;100 per week.<br>
                A new Citizen's Pension, worth &pound;100 a week and rising in 
                line with earnings, is at the centre of radical new proposals 
                for pensions reform, published today by the National Association 
                of Pension Funds (NAPF).<br>
                In its wide-ranging policy paper &quot;Pensions - Plain and Simple&quot; 
                the NAPF sets out a number of key reforms which would boost incomes 
                for the poorest pensioners, strip away complexity, encourage consumers 
                to save more, remove barriers to workplace pension provision, 
                and improve consumer understanding and protection. <br>
                The proposals include replacing the present tangle of State provision 
                with a single, universal, flat rate payment worth about 22% of 
                average earnings and rising in line with earnings. Beyond that, 
                individuals will be encouraged to make extra provision, either 
                through the workplace or with personal or Stakeholder pension 
                providers. <br>
                Among the key recommendations in &quot;Pensions - Plain and Simple&quot; 
                are:<br>
                &middot; replace the tangle of existing State pensions with a 
                single, universal, flat rate Citizen's Pension worth &pound;100 
                a week at present and rising in line with earnings;<br>
                &middot; abolish restrictions on retirement age, but raise the 
                age at which the new Citizen's Pension becomes available from 
                65 to 70 between 2020 and 2030 - allowing the new, more generous 
                pension to be provided at no additional cost to the public purse;<br>
                &middot; offer more generous tax treatment for longer-term savings, 
                rewarding pension savers more than savers in ISAs or other short-term 
                savings vehicles; <br>
                &middot; abolish rules limiting individuals' ability to join more 
                than one pension scheme;<br>
                &middot; offer better pension protection for occupational pension 
                scheme members nearing retirement age whose employer goes bust;<br>
                &middot; remove rules preventing employees continuing to work 
                for the same employer while drawing down part of their pension; 
                and<br>
                &middot; abolish rules restricting the amount individuals can 
                pay in, or receive in benefits from, their pension scheme.<br>
                Launching the paper, NAPF Chairman, Peter Thompson, said:<br>
                &quot;Today's pension system is weighed down by red tape, jargon 
                and complexity. Because of this, too many of today's workers are 
                put off thinking about pensions, storing up potentially massive 
                problems for the future. The proposals we have published today 
                tackle this problem head-on. They would replace the present over-complicated 
                mix of State pension provision with a single, flat rate Citizen's 
                Pension, payable to everyone, set at a high enough rate to help 
                more pensioners out of poverty, and linked to rises in earnings 
                rather than prices. This would be achieved at no extra cost to 
                the public purse. Today's workers would then know exactly where 
                they stand. They will also know that if they wish to enjoy a more 
                comfortable income in retirement, they must make additional arrangements, 
                either through the workplace or with a personal pension provider. 
                With this one straightforward and affordable change, the whole 
                picture becomes simpler. Not only are the various State pensions 
                rolled into one, but the need for complex decisions over contracting 
                in or out of the State scheme is removed, along with a forest 
                of red tape. &#133;.. These proposals are a well-thought out, 
                costed and effective answer to many of the problems which threaten 
                to push today's pension system into crisis. I hope the Government 
                will use them in drawing up its own reform proposals to be published 
                later this year.&quot;<br>

              <p>The Select Committee on Work and Pensions' Social Security Committee's 
                second report on the Integrated Child Credit stated: &quot;We 
                value the role of universal Child Benefit and believe it should 
                continue to play a substantial role in supporting the children 
                of this country. We welcome the commitment from the Chancellor 
                to Child Benefit. We recommend that the Government takes steps 
                to ensure that, as integration develops, a separately identifiable 
                universal element, presently Child Benefit, is preserved.&quot; 
                The Government's response states: &quot;The Government is committed 
                to Child Benefit as the foundation of support for families with 
                children. In the last parliament the rates of Child Benefit for 
                the first child were raised by 26% in real terms. On 31 May [2001] 
                the Chancellor said: 'Millions of families can be absolutely reassured 
                that not only will Child Benefit not be taxed, it will remain 
                universal, and in the (next) parliament it will rise in line with 
                prices.' Child Benefit will continue to form the universal foundation 
                of support for families.&quot;</p>
              <p>In an assessment of the New Deal, Dave Simmonds reports in the 
                journal Working Brief (issue 135, p.10), from the Centre for Social 
                Inclusion, that Treasury calculations show that the introduction 
                of the Working Tax Credit will make a single person over 25 in 
                work 18.5% better off on average. He suggests that &quot;this 
                should have an impact on incentivising people to take jobs and 
                stay in jobs,&quot; but concludes that &quot;to be effective as 
                an incentive people need to know about in-work benefits and have 
                confidence in the 'better off' calculations done by Jobcentre 
                Plus and other agencies. A major effort will be needed to communicate 
                the general message that 'work pays', as well as increasing the 
                capacity to deliver high standard advice.&quot; In issue 137 (p.13), 
                in a discussion of the needs of 16 to 18 year olds who are not 
                in work or education, the Centre suggests that the current &quot;system 
                of discretionary payments needs to be replaced by a wider entitlement 
                to financial support in return for a commitment to enter learning:&quot; 
                a 'Learning Allowance' &quot;of at least &pound;40 per week as 
                the core financial mechanism for supporting young people who do 
                not enter paid employment or an apprenticeship at age 16 &#133;.. 
                . The mix of financial support received by young people and their 
                families should not favour either the work-based route to learning 
                or college and school participation beyond the age of 16&quot; 
                (pp.22-3).</p>
              <p>In 2000, John Veit-Wilson published an article, 'States of Welfare: 
                A Conceptual Challenge' (Social Policy and Administration, vol.34, 
                no.1, March 2000, pp.1-25), suggesting that the term 'welfare 
                state' has such an imprecise meaning that it is contributing nothing 
                to the debate on poverty. He suggested that 'welfare state' should 
                be taken to mean that the state &quot;ensures a minimum real income 
                for all.&quot; Now, two years later, Charles Atherton has responded, 
                saying that Veit-Wilson's approach is &quot;too limiting&quot; 
                ('Welfare States: A Response to John Veit-Wilson', Social Policy 
                and Administration, vol.36, no.3, June 2002, pp.306-311) and that 
                'welfare state' is legitimately used as a description of &quot;those 
                societies that have used the welfare state to reduce substantially 
                the depth and incidence of poverty.&quot; Veit-Wilson responds 
                in the same edition of Social Policy and Administration ('States 
                of Welfare: A Response to Charles Atherton', vol.36, no.3, June 
                2002, pp.312-317), saying again that the term should be restricted 
                to &quot;states which offer a minimum real level of living to 
                all their citizens.&quot; Veit-Wilson recognises that such an 
                income might be means-tested, and at the same time writes that 
                &quot;tests of desert are features of the Poor Law, not the welfare 
                state&quot; (p.314). Since Jobseekers' Allowance is conditional, 
                it would seem that the UK does not have a welfare state.</p>
              <p>The Department for Work and Pensions reports that the Government 
                has decided that from April 2003 the normal method of paying benefits 
                and pensions will be by credit transfer directly into a bank or 
                building society account. Nearly half of all recipients already 
                receive their payments in this way and more than 80% already have 
                access to a bank or building society account. Order books and 
                girocheques will be phased out gradually, and by 2005 all benefits 
                will be paid direct into an account. The Inland Revenue is also 
                to pay some tax credits directly into accounts. For people new 
                to banking a 'basic' bank account will be available from banks 
                and building societies (which will enable people to pay money 
                in and get cash out), and, for anyone unable or unwilling to open 
                a current or basic account, a card account at the Post Office 
                will provide access to benefits payments.</p>
              <p><b>Events</b></p>
              <p>The Ninth Congress of the Basic Income European Network, Income 
                Security as a Right, was held in Geneva from the 12th to the 14th 
                September. </p>
              <p>For three glorious, blue-skied days, more than 200 delegates 
                congregated in the imposing building which houses the International 
                Labour Office above the shores of Lake Geneva, to explore the 
                implications of introducing various types of Basic Income schemes, 
                and to hear how the debate has progressed in different parts of 
                the world. <br>
                This must have been the largest BIEN Congress so far, in terms 
                both of the number of delegates and of the number of presentations 
                offered. The large number of participants was exciting but changed 
                the congress from being an intimate meeting where one could have 
                a conversation with most people to a gathering in which it was 
                harder work to get to know people. There were about 110 presentations 
                in all: some were invited papers, but the majority were given 
                during parallel sessions, which meant that a participant could 
                hear about 40 papers at most, leaving the participant frustrated 
                at having to miss so many other interesting papers. One of the 
                notable features was the number of eminent speakers. His Excellency 
                Dr. Pascoal Manuel Mocumbi, Prime Minister of the Republic of 
                Mozambique, took a day out of his busy schedule to hear some of 
                the presentations, and expressed himself very interested in the 
                idea. The Director General of the International Labout Organisation, 
                Juan Somavia, welcomed the subject matter, 'income security as 
                a right' as being central to the ILO's interests, tackling as 
                it does the underlying causes of economic insecurity. Another 
                delegate who took a keen interest was Pierre-Francois Unger, the 
                Conseiller d'Etat for the Canton of Geneva, with a post in the 
                Department of Social Affairs and Health. The UK fielded two eminent 
                speakers: Professors Tony Atkinson and Raymond Plant (who sent 
                his paper but was unable to be present in person), economist and 
                philosopher respectively, each of whom has contributed to CIT 
                events in the past. Also present were Eduardo Suplicy, who is 
                Senator for Sao Paulo in Brazil, and who has been attending BIEN 
                Congresses since 1994; Rehman Sobhan, an eminent economist from 
                Bangladesh; and Dharam Ghai, the former Director-General of the 
                United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD), 
                now retired and researching social protection and poverty alleviation. 
                <br>
                There were six themes running through the Congress: Assessing 
                selectivity; Citizenship credit cards; Workfare vs Basic Income; 
                Income security for Care Work; Income Security for development; 
                and Legitimising Basic Income Politically.<br>
                Sometimes it seems quite difficult to find new things to say about 
                basic income, since the implications have already been well worked 
                out, but two things bring a freshness; one is the type of welfare 
                systems which are currently being implemented, so that comparisons 
                may force us to view BI in a different light, and the second is 
                that new delegates bring new enthusiasms. We were very privileged 
                to be able to welcome to this Congress many delegates from developing 
                countries, particularly from South America and from Africa, from 
                which came an enthusiastic contingent of young South Africans. 
                As often happens, new delegates referred to means tested benefits 
                (MTBs) rather than to a true BI system, and maybe this would be 
                easier to implement in a poor country. There was some discussion 
                as to whether there was a critical threshold of wealth necessary 
                before a country could implement a BI or MTB scheme, and it was 
                thought that the poorest countries would need international aid. 
                It was suggested that it would be far more effective if international 
                aid could be given in the form of a BI, rather than as grants 
                to the leaders of countries to buy prestigious goods from the 
                donor country with few controls on how the aid is spent. Uma Devi 
                queried whether a BI scheme is only feasible in rich western countries 
                with cash economies, and to what extent it would be dependent 
                on the process of globalisation. Certainly, there has to be both 
                a culture and an infrastructure of tax collection and benefit 
                distribution for a BI to be implemented<br>
                Eduardo Suplicy reported the successful institution of a conditional 
                BI for children in Brazil, which has helped to reduce the problem 
                of street children. A benefit is paid to poor families for each 
                child, so long as the child attends school for 85 % of the time. 
                Families are reclaimimg their children from the streets, now that 
                they can afford to feed them, and school attendance has risen 
                dramatically.<br>
                Another perceptible change in the BIEN Congresses is the increase 
                in the number of delegates from North America. A few years ago, 
                the emphasis in the USA was on the distribution of shares, which 
                might seem more appropriate for a country which abhors taxation. 
                However, there have always been American advocates of BI, at least 
                since the Negative Income Tax experiments of the 1960s. For the 
                last few years there has been a very real example of an annual 
                BI in the form of The Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend. Professor 
                Scott Goldsmith reported on the history and success of this 'Experiment 
                in Wealth Distribution', resulting from substantial tax revenues 
                from oil production since 1977. <br>
                It has long seemed to me that the BI argument will be won or lost 
                on philosophical or political grounds, rather than straight economic 
                ones, and I can listen to the discussions for 'legitimising Basic 
                Income politically' all day, trying to find new debating points 
                or examples to add to my quiver of arguments. Rosamund Stock's 
                paper 'The Psychological Rationale for Basic Income' provided 
                fascinating insights into the connection between the different 
                bases for the distribution of resources in society and the different 
                types of relationships which they foster. This again brings us 
                to the key question for any discussion on welfare reform: 'What 
                sort of society would we like to be part of and help to create 
                ?'<br>
                Once again, I left the Congress with my head buzzing and full 
                of ideas, wishing that there had been more time to talk with people, 
                to hear more papers, and to read more of the unheard ones. Two 
                and a half days, interspersed with receptions by the city and 
                by the ILO itself, is really too short a period to solve all the 
                problems of the world!<br>

              </p>
              <p>The 4th International Research Conference on Social Security, 
                Social Security in a Long Life Society, will be held in Brussels 
                from the 5th to the 7th May 2003. <br>
                The organizers write: &quot;Demographic ageing, globalisation 
                processes, radical changes in traditional family structures have 
                major impacts on everyone's lives. The lengthening of the average 
                life span has resulted in a tremendous impact on society, creating 
                fresh opportunities as well as new risks. This demographic shift 
                has been accompanied by new life patterns and family arrangements. 
                It has also altered the balance between work and leisure time 
                - a trend magnified by the shrinking duration of the working life 
                and by less stable patterns of employment. Overall, these developments 
                challenge the validity and adequacy of existing social security 
                programmes. The evolving nature of the life cycle - and new associated 
                risks - need to be described, analysed and taken into account 
                in the development of innovative policies. Comparative research 
                can offer invaluable guidance to policy makers in reshaping social 
                security programmes to satisfy the challenges and opportunities 
                of the emerging 'long life society'.&quot;<br>

                National Policy Forum's Consultation Document A Modern Welfare 
                State.</b><br>
              </p>
              <p><b>Introduction</b><br>
              </p>
              <p>The Labour Government's introduction of various tax credits is 
                welcome as an improvement on Conservative policies because it 
                has reduced the extremely high effective marginal tax rates which 
                resulted from the withdrawal of benefits as income from paid work 
                rose. However, the present and proposed marginal rates of 60% 
                to 70% are still much higher than the combined rates of Income 
                Tax and National Insurance Contribution and they result in eligibility 
                for benefit extending much further up the income scale. This means 
                that we are still supplementing the incomes of the very poor by 
                depriving those who are not quite so poor, instead of introducing 
                a truly progressive tax system.<br>
                We should change our approach to a higher Income Tax rate for 
                all and much higher rates on higher incomes, up to 60% for the 
                highest incomes, as in the period from 1979 to 1988 under Conservative 
                rule. This should be combined with a Citizen's Income, an unconditional 
                income paid to all, regardless of gender, marital or employment 
                status, without means-testing and varying only with age. The levels 
                of Citizen's Income and the rates of Income Tax (including employees' 
                National Insurance Contribution) could and should be set in such 
                a way that the net payment of income tax offset by the Citizen's 
                Income by everyone below male median earnings would be less than 
                now.<br>
              </p>
              <p><b>Detailed response</b><br>
              </p>
              <p>On page 3, the document sets out some guiding principles: <br>
                &quot;Work is the most secure means of averting poverty. We are 
                reshaping the welfare state so it helps and encourages those of 
                working age to work where they are capable of doing so. But for 
                those who cannot work Labour will provide security. We want to 
                ensure pensioners share fairly in the rising prosperity of the 
                nation. Those who are disabled should get the support they need 
                to live a fulfilling life with dignity. Tackling child poverty 
                is central to our approach and we're rebuilding the welfare state 
                to support families with children.&quot; <br>
                There is a recognition that &quot;modernisation of the welfare 
                state has to be a long term project&quot; and that a &quot;whole 
                new culture for welfare&quot; is required. The emphasis in this 
                new culture is on 'work', by which is meant paid employment, and 
                the document calls for responses to the following questions:<br>
                &quot;Are we right to focus on work as the best form of welfare?<br>
                &quot;What more should we be doing to help people into work, stay 
                in work and progress at work?<br>
                &quot;Many people have particular difficulty in getting work such 
                as people over 50, black and other ethnic minorities, lone parents, 
                women returnees and those with long term health problems. How 
                can we best tackle unfair job discrimination?<br>
                &quot;How can and should we build upon the New Deal ?&quot; (p.6)<br>
                To which our response is:<br>
                Since a large proportion of the population is unable to engage 
                in paid work (especially pensioners, children and those with caring 
                responsibilities), state benefits are as important as earned income. 
                Therefore an adequate level of state benefits is vital, and the 
                way in which such an income is paid is crucial.<br>
                Reduce further the poverty and unemployment traps by paying to 
                every citizen a small unconditional income and reducing their 
                tax allowances and means-tested benefits to pay for it. Because 
                the administrative costs of such a Citizen's Income would be extremely 
                low (as are those for Child Benefit) and because even the smallest 
                Citizen's Income would reduce the effects of the unemployment 
                and poverty traps, there is no reason for resisting the logic 
                of this proposal.<br>
                A Citizen's Income would enhance the flexibility of the labour 
                market by making part-time employment more attractive. This would 
                particularly benefit lone parents, women returnees, people over 
                50, and those with long-term health problems. <br>
                A more flexible labour market would enable the New Deal to offer 
                a broader range of employment options to those who currently find 
                it difficult to find or remain in paid employment.<br>
                The third and fourth responses together also apply to the following 
                two questions: &quot;What more help should we give disabled people 
                to help them find work, stay in work or make an early return to 
                work?&quot; (p.6). &quot;What can we do to help people whose circumstances 
                often exclude them from taking up paid work, such as lone parents 
                and disabled people ?&quot; (p.7). <br>
                The move to tax credits is an improvement on Family Credit, but 
                a question remains as to how women in households, and particularly 
                non-earning women, will gain or maintain financial independence.<br>
                The next step is to transform tax credits into a Citizen's Income, 
                a step which would lower marginal tax rates even further and would 
                thus improve on the already beneficial effects of tax credits.<br>
                In answer to the question &quot;How can we ensure that this help 
                gets to everyone entitled to it?&quot; (p.7), we would point out 
                that, because a Citizen's Income would be paid automatically to 
                every citizen, there would be no take-up issues to discuss; and 
                in response to the question &quot;What are the main barriers to 
                making work pay and what more can we do about them?&quot; (p.7) 
                we have already discussed above the reduction of marginal tax 
                rates and the effect which this would have on the attraction of 
                paid employment. The same reduction in marginal rates would also, 
                of course, encourage people to increase their skills and to seek 
                higher-paid jobs: both important ways of making work pay.<br>
                A real problem related both to means-tested benefits and to tax 
                credits is the uncertainty which people experience as they move 
                from unemployment to employment, or from one pay-level to another. 
                A Citizen's Income of any size would increase the predictability 
                of the change in individuals' net income which would follow a 
                change in employment status.<br>
                The consultation document discusses steps which have already been 
                taken to ease the return to work. These have all been helpful. 
                In response to the question &quot;What more needs to be done? 
                We want to help parents balance work and home responsibilities. 
                How can the welfare system help?&quot; (p.8), we would respond: 
                Enabling the labour market to offer a far greater variety of employment 
                patterns would be of immense help. The continuing rigidities of 
                the tax, tax credit and benefit systems mean that part-time employment 
                of varying numbers of hours and of varying earnings remains problematic. 
                A Citizen's Income would ease the transition to such a labour 
                market.<br>
                In relation to the problem of housing benefit, we would draw attention 
                to our extended treatment of this complex issue in the Citizen's 
                Income Newsletter, issue 1, 2002.<br>
                Much has been achieved in relation to child poverty. In response 
                to the questions &quot;Are we right to treat work as the best 
                form of welfare for those able to do so? What further help do 
                people need to make the most of work opportunities?&quot; (p.9), 
                the answers are 'Yes, provided the employment on offer is sufficiently 
                flexible,' and 'Greater opportunities to be employed with very 
                flexible hours.' And in response to the question &quot;Are we 
                right to concentrate on children as the best way to help families?&quot; 
                (p.9), the answer is again 'Yes'. The one-off increase in Child 
                Benefit contributed to the reduction of child poverty; and similar 
                one-off increases would be enormously helpful - provided Child 
                Benefit remains unconditional and non-means-tested and thus contributes 
                no deepening to the poverty and unemployment traps.<br>
                In answer to the question: &quot;How do we ensure that these policies 
                reach the widest number of people - how do we ensure that they 
                are simple and effective?&quot; (p.10) we would respond: Child 
                Benefit is simple and effective, and take-up is not a problem; 
                and an increase in Child Benefit is an important part of the solution 
                to child poverty.<br>
                The dilemmas which the Government faces in relation to pension 
                provision are real, particularly at the moment. In answer to the 
                question &quot;Should we continue, while building on the foundation 
                of the basic state pension, to do more to support the poorest 
                pensioners and reward the thrift of pensioners with modest savings, 
                or, as an alternative, should all our resources go to increasing 
                the basic state pension for everyone?&quot; (p.12) our response 
                is: The latter. If a Citizen's Pension were paid to every elderly 
                citizen unconditionally, then the maximum possible incentive to 
                save for old age and to invest in private pension provision will 
                have been offered. Means-testing would then affect only a minority 
                of pensioners, particularly if the Citizen's Pension were to rise 
                with increasing national prosperity. (This response is also an 
                answer to the questions on page 13: &quot;What should the main 
                priorities of the Pension Service be?&quot; &quot;We want to encourage 
                everyone who can afford to save for their retirement to do so. 
                What more should we be doing?&quot; ) The proposed Pension Credit 
                gives some reward to pensioners who have additional pensions or 
                savings and the Minimum Income Guarantee helps the poorest pensioners. 
                We recognise that at the moment there might not be sufficient 
                resources for an unconditional Citizen's Pension for everyone 
                over 65, especially in view of the large increase in numbers reaching 
                that age between 2011 and 2032. However, a Citizen's Pension at 
                the level of the Minimum Income Guarantee could be paid now to 
                everyone over 75, so that most people above that age would no 
                longer be subject to means-testing.<br>
                In answer to the question &quot;How best do we encourage flexibility 
                into the retirement age?&quot; we would respond that a Citizen's 
                Pension, because it would not be means-tested, would encourage 
                older people to undertake paid work if they wished to do so. <br>

              </p>
              <p>The questions which the consultation document asks are appropriate. 
                The Labour Government has already provided some answers to those 
                questions. A Citizen's Income offers an innovative way of preventing 
                poverty whilst maintaining incentives for individuals to engage 
                in paid work and to save. It is therefore time for a high-level 
                discussion of the universal benefits approach to the reform of 
                tax and benefits. The Citizen's Income Trust will be glad to facilitate 
                such a discussion.<br>

              <p>Our first issue for this year was on housing costs, and we particularly 
                noted the Pivot Initiative's proposals for Housing Benefit reform. 
                The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has now issued its own report on 
                the subject, in which Kemp, Wilcox and Rhodes concentrate on two 
                particular problems: the effects of rent restrictions and the 
                relationship between Housing Benefit and tax credits.<br>
                The Local Reference Rent and the Single Room Rent (which restrict 
                the level of rent on which Housing Benefit is calculated) are 
                aptly described as 'trip wires', because their effects are often 
                unknown until the tenancy agreement has been signed and Housing 
                Benefit applied for. The Foundation suggests that a more transparent 
                system which would at the same time provide a 'shopping incentive' 
                (an incentive for someone to seek cheaper accommodation) would 
                be to increase social security benefit levels by 25% of the local 
                average housing cost and then calculate Housing Benefit on 80% 
                of actual rent rather than on 100% of the restricted rent as at 
                present. (The Pivot Initiative suggest a similar solution). The 
                researchers model three schemes and conclude that there would 
                be less shortfall and thus increased cost.<br>
                The second major problem the report tackles is the fact that families 
                can suffer a 95% maximum marginal benefit deduction as Working 
                Families Tax Credit, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit are 
                all reduced as income rises. Two solutions are offered: 1) A housing 
                tax credit which would taper out first, followed by the tapering 
                of other tax credits. (A housing tax credit, and tapering Housing 
                Benefit and Council Tax Benefit one after the other, are Pivot 
                Initiative solutions). This would reduce the maximum marginal 
                benefit deduction but would move the taper further up the income 
                scale. 2) A flat rate housing costs contribution (a partial tax 
                credit) could be added to existing tax credits to complement rather 
                than replace Housing Benefit. Again, 25% of average local rent 
                is suggested. With both solutions, of course, a new complexity 
                is added to an already complex situation, as regional variations 
                in housing costs would make tax credits in one area different 
                from those in another. The administrative problems which would 
                result are not fully explored. <br>
                Like the Pivot Initiative's report, Hope for Housing Benefit: 
                A Strategy for Housing Benefit Reform (Pivot Initiative, 2001), 
                this report also suggests bringing low income home-owners into 
                the Housing Benefit / housing tax credit system, and it also tackles 
                the issue of payment periods. <br>
                Kemp, Wilcox and Rhodes had the benefit of the Pivot Initiative's 
                report during the latter part of their work, which might be one 
                cause of the considerable unanimity between the two reports. Another 
                cause must be that the problems encountered with Housing Benefit 
                have some pretty obvious solutions. We would merely add, as we 
                did in issue 1 for this year, that to pay a locally-agreed nonwithdrawable 
                Housing Benefit to everyone would provide the greatest possible 
                shopping incentive and would remove the taper completely and thus 
                provide a far greater incentive to seek employment: something 
                which people living in London and who are unemployed and on Housing 
                Benefit are understandably hesitant to do. <br>
                An issue which does not appear with anything like the frequency 
                or the emphasis it should have in such reports as this is the 
                issue of administrative complexity, both of the present system 
                and of any proposed replacement or revision. Perhaps teams of 
                Housing Benefit researchers should contain at least one member 
                currently working in a Local Authority Housing Benefit department.

              <p>Written by scholars from the British, Scandinavian and continental 
                European welfare state traditions, this compilation provides an 
                informative and stimulating account of recent developments in 
                European labour markets and social security systems. Contributions 
                take a variety of forms - surveys of general trends, conceptual 
                discourses, single-country case-studies and cross-national comparisons 
                - but what holds the book together is the editors' insistence 
                that, besides describing and explaining the changes that have 
                taken place over the past twenty years in the institutions of 
                the work-welfare complex, the paradigms that guide public policy 
                towards it and the norms that shape social behaviour within it, 
                contributors should also reflect on the significance of these 
                changes for the social dimension of citizenship.<br>
                Amidst a wealth of detailed findings and observations, some general 
                themes stand out. All welfare states confront common external 
                and domestic pressures for change, but the ways in which governments 
                and other social actors respond to these pressures vary widely 
                from one country to another. For example, comparative evidence 
                provides scant support for the standard neo-liberal claim that 
                contemporary unemployment is caused by a combination of skill 
                mismatch, labour market rigidity and dysfunctional tax and social 
                security systems, and can only be cured by some combination of 
                increased wage flexibility, investment in human capital and direct 
                or indirect subsidies for low-productivity work. There is, in 
                fact, no single best way to reduce unemployment, raise employment 
                and increase labour market participation, either in the aggregate 
                or among targeted social groups such as young people, older workers 
                and ethnic minorities. The same applies to other social objectives 
                such as the pursuit of gender equality.<br>
                Moreover, strategies which are equally effective in achieving 
                these goals have divergent implications for citizenship, for here 
                what counts is not just success in creating jobs and activating 
                people who are, or risk becoming, disconnected from the labour 
                market, but success in overcoming insider-outsider divisions, 
                minimizing long-term unemployment, averting poverty and widening 
                the remit of work-welfare policy to encompass unpaid caregiving, 
                voluntary work and other socially valued, but unremunerated activities. 
                The contrast between, say, Denmark and the UK is instructive in 
                this regard. Since the early 1990s unemployment in both countries 
                has fallen steadily, but whereas the former has maintained generous 
                levels of social protection and has retained its traditionally 
                egalitarian ethos and income distribution, the latter's continued 
                drive to recommodify the labour market and create a residual welfare 
                state has taken it even further away from the partial, uneven 
                and fragile form of social citizenship that was established after 
                the Second World War.<br>
                It is reassuring to find that social scientists still have some 
                use for the concept of social citizenship, both as an analytical 
                category and as a normative ideal. It is also chastening to be 
                reminded what a slippery concept it is and what formidable difficulties 
                confront renewed efforts to pursue it in the age of the global 
                market, when old sources of social solidarity, formed in the course 
                of conflicts between classes and wars between nations, are finally 
                exhausted and when, in Europe at any rate, social policy is increasingly 
                influenced by interactions between states and by supranational 
                regulation, as well as by more traditional interactions between 
                national governments and domestic interest groups.<br>

              <p>The issue of income maintenance in later life is one of considerable 
                interest to the individual and the wider society. When the 'post 
                work' phase of life can last as long, if not longer, than the 
                period of participation in the labour market, issues of maintaining 
                incomes for this period become paramount. Indeed the whole issue 
                of pension provision is assuming increasing prominence in the 
                policy area and is one where the interface between, and the controversy 
                concerning, the respective roles of public and private provision 
                is seen clearly. These debates are of particular relevance to 
                women who, because of the nature of their employment patterns 
                and their involvement in a variety of caring activities, are especially 
                vulnerable to the experience of poverty and low income in old 
                age.<br>
                This edited collection of 13 chapters contributed by leading scholars 
                examines the position of women and their pension arrangements 
                in six 'liberal' welfare states. Through these 'case studies' 
                and several overview chapters the authors demonstrate a consistent 
                pattern of the 'feminisation' of poverty in later life. However, 
                the contributors also look behind this broad generalisation to 
                demonstrate the differential impact of factors such as class and 
                ethnicity upon women's income levels in later life. It is clearly 
                inadequate to deal with 'older' women as a single, homogeneous 
                group. Rather we must develop a more sophisticated analysis to 
                incorporate issues such as class, age and ethnicity. Several authors 
                also consider the influence of 'cohorts' by considering the likely 
                pension situation for future generations of elders. Whilst future 
                cohorts may be less handicapped by 'caring' responsibilities, 
                changes in pension legislation is likely to have a differential 
                impact upon those who are employed part time or have interrupted 
                working careers. Overall this is an excellent book that is extremely 
                timely, highly policy relevant and well written and organised. 
                It should be of interest to many colleagues; especially those 
                concerned with issues of social policy, feminist studies and gerontology.<br>

              <p>This volume, published for the Foundation for International Studies 
                on Social Security has thirteen chapters ordered into three parts. 
                The idea of the volume is that ethics enters into social policy 
                in various ways. Most obviously it enters in the concepts and 
                definitions that guide the principles of social policy. Secondly, 
                ethical considerations are important for the political feasibility 
                of different forms of social policy. Thirdly, they enter into 
                our evaluation of the successes and failures of different social 
                policies. <br>
                The first part contains five essays. Schokkaert's essay suggests 
                social institutions can be evaluated in terms of positive and 
                negative liberty, though the former turns out to be welfare understood 
                as avoidance of poverty, and negative freedom turns out to be 
                personal responsibility and privacy. Westerhall's essay is a good 
                case study of how changing a social policy may bring about inconsistencies, 
                here with regard to the employed and unemployed in Swedish sickness 
                benefit. Burgess points out how refugees are treated so differently 
                in different countries raising questions about the natural scope 
                of equality. The importance of ethical issues in the framing of 
                problems is brought out in two essays on the measure of poverty. 
                The first essay is by Robert Haveman and Melissa Mullikin and 
                the second is by Jonathan Bradshaw. There are a number of different 
                ways of measuring poverty and the choice of index will lead to 
                different measures of the level, the distribution and the trend 
                of poverty with obvious policy implications. As with Schokkaert, 
                Haveman and Mullikin favour Sen's capability approach though how 
                well they operationalize this concept is questionable. Bradshaw 
                discusses absolute poverty measures, though does not take enough 
                account of the relative wealth and moral expectations of different 
                nations.<br>
                The two essays in the second part deal adequately with moral expectations. 
                Saunders' and Pinyopusarerk's table (Table 2.1.4) shows that the 
                Australians they sampled have similar views about the state's 
                treatment of different categories of unemployed people, with about 
                a third thinking the state has got it about right, while one quarter 
                think the state does too much or not enough (the rest are 'don't 
                know's). The only categories that stand out are the older unemployed 
                (over 50) where few think the state does too much, and over half 
                think the state does too little; and migrants where only about 
                10% think the state does too little. The tables also show that 
                most people think that the unemployed should show they are looking 
                for work. The tables provides few surprises and the analysis in 
                terms of cultural theory categories does not add much.<br>
                The third part evaluates different institutional structures for 
                the provision of social policy. The six chapters in this part 
                are a rather mixed bunch of essays mostly considering social policies 
                and labour market participation. The first three concentrate on 
                the different incentives which are produced by different social 
                policy schemes. The best of them, and probably the best essay 
                in the collection, is by Barbara Wolfe, who discusses a scheme 
                in Wisconsin which attempts to reduce dependency by those receiving 
                state assistance. Providing work incentives for benefit recipients 
                while providing a safety net and high marginal rates of taxation 
                is problematic. She suggests that a complex strategy consisting 
                of a mix of health care, full employment practices, training, 
                loans and so on will best be able to overcome these problems. 
                But the reader is left with the impression that a careful analysis 
                (along the lines of her study of Wisconsin) of her own recommended 
                strategy if ever it were to be put into practice would reveal 
                a whole host of similar problems. Indeed, this impression is gained 
                for most of the recommendations of the writers in this part. Each 
                author analyses some current social policy and then thinks of 
                potential answers which may overcome particular problems; but 
                there seems little to assure the reader that other problems, not 
                considered by the would-be reformer, have been addressed properly. 
                <br>
                The volume gains through being consciously theoretical whilst 
                examining practical policy problems, and gains through being comparative 
                across nations. The impression that is left, however, is that 
                whilst ethical attitudes are obviously important to the development 
                and implementation of social security, no-one in the volume, and 
                no nation in the world, has come to terms with different and competing 
                ethical demands. Either some demands must be left unsatisfied, 
                or more radical departures from the standard answers are required 
                which give basic security whilst allowing good market principles 
                and self-determining incentives to exist.<br>

              <p>&quot;This report provides updated statistics for 50 indicators 
                which between them portray the key features of poverty and social 
                exclusion today in Great Britain. Whilst income is the focus of 
                many of the indicators, they also cover a wide range of other 
                subjects including health, education, work, and engagement in 
                community activities. &#133;. Each indicator is presented on a 
                single page, and comprises two graphs: one showing how the indicator 
                has changed over time and the other typically showing how the 
                indicator varies between different groups within the population&quot; 
                (p.5). <br>
                The report lists improvements in education, in housing, and in 
                some aspects of health, but identifies continuing areas of concern, 
                many of which relate to income levels and inequalities. Particular 
                concern is expressed that children are more likely than adults 
                to live in low income households, and that two million children 
                live in workless households. &quot;From a monitoring perspective, 
                the two key questions are first, whether the [Government's] initiatives 
                are collectively sufficient to address the scale and depth of 
                the problems over time and, second, how successful they are in 
                helping the more disadvantaged to catch up - or at least keep 
                up - with the rest of society&quot; (p.8). <br>
                Of interest to readers of this journal will be the fact that the 
                number of people on means-tested benefits fell from 1995 to 1999 
                and then rose again in 2000 (with the replacement of Family Credit 
                with the means-tested Working Families Tax Credit in October 1999). 
                The executive summary misleadingly records a fall (an 'improvement') 
                in the number of people on means-tested benefits from 1999 to 
                2000. (It is only a fall if the tax credit is ignored). <br>
                What of course does not appear in reports such as this is the 
                percentage of families on Child Benefit because that is always 
                nearly 100%. Thus the beneficial effects which Child Benefit has 
                (e.g., disproportionately increasing low incomes and thus reducing 
                income inequality) are not give the recognition which they are 
                due. Maybe future editions could give some recognition to the 
                effect of Child Benefit on income inequality and to the way in 
                which it enhances the incomes of many low-paid families without 
                creating labour market disincentives.<br>
                The Joseph Rowntree Foundation is to be commended on this excellent 
                publication.</p>

              <p><i>Debunking weasel words: 'Targeting'</i><br>
              </p>
              <p>Governments often use words which have little or no meaning, 
                relying on the public to invest them with the meaning that they, 
                the public, wish them to have. Such a word is 'targeting'. The 
                current Labour Government has said that it &quot;will target its 
                limited resources on those who need them most&quot;. Let's test 
                my hypothesis here. Write down what this statement means to you. 
                To a trusting citizen, who assumes that the Government will carry 
                out its responsibility to the less fortunate in society, he or 
                she might interpret this statement to mean that whilst the Government 
                reluctantly is unable to institute a basic income for everyone, 
                it will make sure that poverty is eradicated, or at least that 
                those most at risk of poverty are relieved of their condition. 
                So, what is promised in such a statement? Let us look at the verb 
                'to target' first of all. This means 'to label something to be 
                aimed at'. What is the criterion for those who need it most? Might 
                it be their costs of disablement? On the other hand, women and 
                children are another obvious group at risk of poverty, and increasing 
                child benefit would be a welcome cure, but that has not been hinted 
                at. The statement does not say how large this target will be. 
                The Government has not committed itself to all of those in need, 
                merely &quot;those who need it most&quot;. How many? Will it be 
                3,000 people, or 30,000, or 3,000,000? <br>
                What will the Government do for those who have been identified 
                as those who need the resources most? Will it ensure that they 
                are lifted out of their state of neediness? The Government's statement 
                does not make any such promise. And finally, what of those who 
                fall just outside the definition? They too are in a state of neediness. 
                Will their needs be met? Again, there is no such promise. In fact, 
                the record of recent governments does not give one much hope of 
                help for them, since governments have on occasion required the 
                less poor to pay for the relief of those in greatest need. So 
                much for 'targeting' - an empty phrase. So, next time you hear 
                a Government minister, or a senior civil servant, claim that they 
                are targeting the resources on those who need them most, make 
                sure that you ask them, a) what criterion is being used to identify 
                those who need it most, b) how many will be targeted, c) how much 
                will be done for those so labelled - will they be relieved of 
                their neediness? d) what will be done for those who fall just 
                outside the criterion, but who also are in need? Make sure that 
                you get a written answer.<br>
