                      this issue we publish the second of a number of previously 
                      unpublished pieces which have recently come to light (the 
                      first was Chris Downs' article on pensions, which we published 
                      in the first edition for this year). This time it's a working 
                      party report on Citizenship and a Citizen's Income, a report 
                      which has needed alteration only in relation to a few details. 
                      We first publish the working party's own summary; then some 
                      news items; and then the report itself. This means that 
                      readers of the printed version of the newsletter will be 
                      able to extract the report if they should wish to, and that 
                      those who view the newsletter on the website will similarly 
                      be able to print out the report. </font></p>

                      The history of citizenship in the UK has been one of increasing 
                      civil, political and social rights, and subsequently of 
                      the decline of those rights - and particularly of social

                      Citizenship today:<br>
                      a) In the UK, there are degrees of citizenship and no univocal 
                      definition of the 'citizen'.<br>
                      b) Some traditional duties of citizenship, and particularly 
                      the duty to seek employment, are now problematic because 
                      not always fulfillable - suggesting that duties need to 
                      be reformulated.<br>
                      c) Civil, political and social rights need an underpinning 
                      of economic rights, and particularly the right to a non-stigmatising 
                      income.<br>

                      paid to every man, woman and child: a flexible social policy 
                      which would alleviate the poverty and unemployment traps, 
                      and a social policy which might provide a new basis for 
                      social citizenship.<br>

                      Who would get it?<br>
                      a) The electoral register could be the basis for entitlement, 
                      but the register would need to include people of no fixed 
                      abode. Decisions would be needed over whether citizens of 
                      other European Union nations should receive a Citizen's 
                      Income (they are currently on the register if they live 
                      here) and whether British citizens abroad should receive 
                      a Citizen's Income.<br>
                      b) Child Benefit is currently paid for the children of anyone 
                      who has resided here for 26 weeks during the past year, 
                      and such a criterion could determine who receives a Citizen's 
                      Income.<br>
                      Either a) or b) or both together could be employed to determine 
                      who receives a Citizen's Income. (To employ a) would encourage 
                      voter registration as a by-product).<br>
                      </font></p>

                      The effects of a Citizen's Income on citizenship<br>
                      a) The definition of the citizen would become clearer as 
                      the payment of a Citizen's Income would help to define a 
                      citizen. A new social solidarity might result.<br>
                      b) Citizenship duties would be redefined (with a broader 
                      definition of work) and many people would find it easier 
                      to fulfil citizenship duties.<br>
                      c) Citizenship rights would be less tied to the labour market, 
                      and at the same time rights to and through the labour market 
                      would be more accessible.<br>
                      d) A Citizen's Income would encourage both social solidarity 
                      and cultural diversity, and a Citizen's Income paid at the 
                      European level as well as at the national level would contribute 
                      to the definition of a European citizenship to complement 
                      our British citizenship.<br>
                      The conclusion raises the question as to whether a prior 
                      definition of citizenship should determine who receives 
                      a Citizen's Income or whether criteria for payment should 
                      help to define citizenship. The latter is more consistent 
                      with the British constitutional tradition.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>

                      residents are formally citizens but have few rights - and 
                      it must be asked whether they are really citizens at all. 
                      In most of the UK we are formally subjects of the monarch

                      terms of the modern debate on citizenship were set by T.H. 
                      Marshall (2) when he formulated his three stages of civil, 
                      political and social rights: legal rights relating to contracts, 
                      followed by rights to participate in a representative democracy, 
                      in turn followed by rights to the benefits of a welfare 
                      state. This was no smooth evolution, but rather a conflict-driven 
                      process and by no means an irreversible one. (3) Neither 
                      is the citizenship which has evolved simply about the nation 
                      state, but is a many-layered reality involving the many 
                      different communities we all belong to: local, sectional, 
                      economic, national, European .... (4)<br>

                      political and social rights relating to the nation state 
                      remain the bedrock of other citizenship rights and duties, 
                      and it is thus nation-state citizenship on which we shall 
                      concentrate: a citizenship which &quot;refers to a status 
                      enjoyed by all full members of a ...... nation state,&quot; 
                      a status which combines elements of universality, equality

                      challenges to the Welfare State. The New Right's fear of 
                      dependency coupled with an economy in which increased investment 
                      frequently means a drop in employment have between them 
                      made rights to welfare and employment problematic. Maurice 
                      Roche sees the combined effects of contemporary changes 
                      as a rolling-back of social citizenship (6) (Marshall's 
                      third category) and the new economic situation we are in 
                      as a requirement that we completely reinvent social citizenship.

                      Who is a citizen? - that is, who are the people to whom 
                      we grant rights and from whom we expect the fulfilment of 
                      duties?<br>
                      There are some things which do not constitute the boundary: 
                      for instance, not all British passport holders have a right 
                      to reside here. And in relation to those things which do 
                      determine the boundary (the Nationality Act, the Asylum 
                      Bill) the boundary is far from fixed.<br>
                      For different purposes the boundary is different. For instance: 
                      Child Benefit is paid to anyone who is responsible for a 
                      child and who has lived here for six out of the past twelve 
                      months - though there are now exceptions (8); and means-tested 
                      benefits can only be paid to someone 'habitually resident' 
                      here, an adjudication on whether or not someone is 'habitually 
                      resident' depending on the six factors: where the person's 
                      centre of interest lies; whether he or she has stable employment; 
                      the nature of the person's occupation; the person's reasons 
                      for coming to the United Kingdom; the length and continuity 
                      of residence outside the United Kingdom; and the person's 
                      future intentions. (9) For those seeking refugee status, 
                      rights to social security have been neither clear nor stable 
                      during the past few years.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      the UK, there are degrees of citizenship. Some people possess 
                      civil rights but some do not (residents awaiting adjudication 
                      on asylum requests cannot enter into a contract of employment), 
                      some people have political rights but some do not (some 
                      foreign nationals have permission to live and work here 
                      but cannot vote; and clergy of the Church of England cannot 
                      sit in the House of Commons); and some people have more 
                      social rights than others (a foreign student might be entitled 
                      to Child Benefit but not to means-tested benefits; to free 
                      education for their children but not to NHS health care 
                      for themselves).<br>
                      There is thus no univocal answer to the question 'Who is 
                      a citizen?' - which is going to pose problems for the administration 
                      of any new universal benefits such as a Citizen's Income: 
                      an unconditional, automatic and nonwithdrawable income for 
                      every citizen. First of all, it is not clear to whom such 
                      an income should be paid, and secondly, the payment criteria 
                      which evolve would effectively determine who is a citizen 
                      and who is not - and it could be argued that this decision 
                      ought not to be made via benefits regulations.<br>

                      as well as a system of rights. (10) A duty formalised in 
                      the seventeenth-century Poor Law and still enshrined in 
                      National Insurance and means-tested benefits legislation 
                      is the obligation to seek employment and the obligation 
                      to take employment if it is offered. In the period of reconstruction 
                      and full employment following the Second World War this 
                      obligation made sense, but now that technological and employment 
                      market change are as rapid as they are, much employment 
                      is short-term, new investment often results in a loss of 
                      employment, and the health of the employment market does 
                      not directly correlate with a country's economic performance. 
                      In general, temporary employment is replacing permanent 
                      employment. (11)<br>

                      duty to work is now problematic, for how can there be a 
                      duty when for many there is no opportunity, and when often 
                      what is available is part-time employment and what is required 
                      to lift a family off means-tested benefits is well-paid 
                      full-time employment? Tax credits mean that no-one should 
                      now suffer benefit withdrawal rates of 100% (which is what 
                      used to happen to recipients of Income Support who found 
                      employment), but the combined withdrawal rate of Tax Credits, 
                      Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit can still be 80%,

                      has been suggested that in this new situation we ought to 
                      alter the definition of 'work' to cover paid and unpaid 
                      work, and particularly caring work in the family and in 
                      the community: that we ought to alter the definition of 
                      'work' to mean 'beneficial activity'. But it is easier to 
                      change one's attitudes when financially and socially secure, 
                      and many of those most in need of being able to re-evaluate 
                      their own unpaid work are those with the least secure incomes 
                      and those facing a variety of kinds of poverty (and this 
                      is particularly the case for those who take their obligations 
                      to their families seriously, for whom financial security 
                      is both more of a necessity and more difficult to achieve). 
                      (12) If as a society we need attitudes to work to change, 
                      then providing individuals with a level of financial security 
                      must be a priority.<br>

                      Marshall's summary ignores any concept of economic rights, 
                      that is, rights to economic resources by virtue of one's 
                      citizenship. This is an important omission, for without 
                      a certain income it is impossible to exercise rights and 
                      duties. If van Gunsteren is correct in saying that &quot;effective 
                      citizenship does not only require a political say and a 
                      legally protected status, but also a certain level of socio-economic 
                      security,&quot; (13) then the welfare state's guarantee 
                      of a minimum income is the foundation of civil, political 
                      and social rights - even though the history and current 
                      reasons for the complex system of benefits is not explicitly 
                      about either the prevention of poverty or the foundation 
                      of citizenship rights. (14)<br>

                      the means by which an income is provided might negate its 
                      status as an economic right, and Fred Twine suggests that 
                      because citizenship is about the relationship between individuals 
                      and institutions, the stigma attached to means-testing means 
                      that &quot;a means-tested benefit cannot provide a social 
                      right of citizenship because it threatens the integrity 
                      of the self.&quot; (15) Means-testing (and Tax Credits are 
                      still means-tested benefits, even if they are administered 
                      by the Inland Revenue) is an intrusive process which divides 
                      people off from those citizens who earn or otherwise receive 
                      an income without the state intruding into their relationships 
                      or their daily activities. So , if economic rights are indeed 
                      a prerequisite of civil, political and social citizenship 
                      rights, then a positive right to resources must be established 
                      which does not rely on a process which excludes people from 
                      a sense of citizenship.<br>

                      and a lack of stigma. (18) In the income maintenance field 
                      current legislation leaves much to be desired in these respects, 
                      for Tax Credits are far from simple in their administration 
                      and they are understood to be intrusive means-tested benefits 
                      (and more intrusive than previous benefits because an employee 
                      can find that their employer knows more about their relationships 
                      than they did before) and thus still carrying a degree of 
                      stigma.<br>

                      'Wealth' &quot;summarises what people value in their social 
                      lives. The wealth of nations is therefore an objective which 
                      transcends the boundaries of economics in the narrow sense. 
                      Wealth must be socially sustainable. This is where social 
                      cohesion comes in to describe a society which offers opportunities 
                      to all its members within a framework of accepted values 
                      and institutions. Such a society is therefore one of inclusion. 
                      People belong: they are not allowed to be excluded. They 
                      show commitment to values and institutions. The result is 
                      a stakeholder society in which companies, organisations 
                      and communities are linked to common purposes. Its members 
                      enjoy the rights and accept the obligations of citizenship.&quot;

                      It could be age-related, and there could be more for elderly 
                      people than for adults of working age and more for adults 
                      than for children. There could also be supplements for disability. 
                      However, there would be no differences on account of income 
                      or wealth, work status, gender or marital status.<br>
                      Citizen's Income is an immensely flexible social policy. 
                      It can operate with a variety of other benefits; it can 
                      operate alongside the National Minimum Wage; it could be 
                      funded by a wide variety of tax regimes; and however large

                      Citizen's Income could be paid for in a variety of ways. 
                      One possibility would be through reducing personal tax allowances 
                      and reducing existing means-tested and National Insurance 
                      benefits. The present system of income tax allowances could 
                      be reduced. Everyone would receive the same Citizen's Income 
                      payment, but richer people might contribute a little more 
                      income tax than under the present system.<br>

                      is of course considerable debate as to how much the Citizen's 
                      Income should be. Initially a Transitional Citizen's Income 
                      would be paid, perhaps of &pound;20 per week for each adult 
                      and &pound;15 per week per child (i.e., &pound;70 per week 
                      for a couple with two children). This level of Citizen's 
                      Income could be paid for by eliminating all tax allowances 
                      (although a personal allowance of &pound;10 per week on 
                      earned income might be retained) and introducing a new 50% 
                      income tax on all incomes above &pound;70,000 p.a... The 
                      Transitional Citizen's Income would be deducted from existing 
                      benefit entitlements. In time, if the experiment were a 
                      success, the Transitional Citizen's Income might grow into 
                      a Partial Citizen's Income, perhaps of half the rate of 
                      Income Support. It is unlikely that a Full Citizen's Income 
                      (&quot;enough to live on&quot;) would ever be either affordable

                      present tax and benefit system is now failing to do the 
                      job it was originally intended to do. It has become complicated 
                      and inefficient. Many young people are left in poverty, 
                      and many adults are still caught in the unemployment trap 
                      (which means that if they find employment their total income

                      if their earnings increase their net income rises very little 
                      - and with Tax Credits the range of earnings to which this

                      because a Transitional Citizen's Income would give families 
                      more choices. At present, if a man becomes unemployed, it 
                      is often not so worthwhile for his partner to remain in 
                      employment because both income-related Jobseekers' Allowance 
                      and Tax Credits take her income into account. With a Citizen's 
                      Income they could decide to forego means-tested benefits 
                      and either she could remain employed, or they could both 
                      work part-time, or they might decide to start a business.

                      Roche follows his call for a reformulation of social citizenship 
                      with the suggestion that a Citizen's Income might provide 
                      a new basis for social citizenship. (24) A Citizen's Income 
                      &quot;would ..... institutionalise citizenship principles 
                      and the social rights of citizenship&quot; (25) - those 
                      principles being universality, equality and participation. 
                      But whatever civil, political, social or economic definition 
                      we give to 'citizenship', a Citizen's Income of any amount 
                      would cohere with such a definition, for it would provide 
                      an economic foundation for individual liberty and for contracts 
                      between individuals, it would encourage political participation 
                      because it would create a measure of social solidarity, 
                      and it would provide a context for other social rights (such

                      a 'Citizen's Income' should be paid to citizens: but we 
                      have already seen that it is no easy matter to determine 
                      who is a citizen and who isn't. And because a Citizen's 
                      Income would to some extent define a citizenry, the decision 
                      as to who should receive it would be a particularly important 
                      one.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
                      possibility is to pay a Citizen's Income to anyone on the 
                      electoral register (and to under-18s if they would be on 
                      the electoral register if they weren't under 18). If the 
                      current register were used this would clearly have problems: 
                      Someone with no address cannot be on the register, so to 
                      give a Citizen's Income only to people on the register would 
                      leave those without an address on lower means-tested benefits 
                      (to which they are entitled) but not entitle them to the 
                      Citizen's Income. Of more importance numerically is the 
                      current state of the register. Approximately 350,000 people 
                      in England and Wales took themselves off the register to 
                      avoid paying the Community Charge, and the register has 
                      still not entirely recovered. In 1993 1.5m people over the 
                      age of 18 had failed to register for one reason or another, 
                      (26) and, whilst registration campaigns have helped this 
                      situation to some extent, and whilst it is now possible 
                      to be included in the register at any point during the year 
                      rather than only at an annual reregistering, the more mobile 
                      nature of our society means that the register will still 
                      be far from accurate. To base a Citizen's Income on such 
                      an inaccurate register might deprive over 1m people of their 
                      entitlement.<br>

                      is however possible that to use the electoral register as 
                      the criterion for payment would encourage people to register 
                      and would thus improve democratic participation. (27) For 
                      this reason the suggestion should be given careful consideration 
                      - but the related problem of who should and who should not 
                      be on the electoral register will still need to be addressed. 
                      Some way would have to be found of including people with 
                      no fixed abode; decisions would need to be taken as to whether 
                      British citizens permanently abroad should a) be on the 
                      electoral register, and b) receive the Citizen's Income; 
                      and decisions would need to be taken as to which foreign 
                      nationals resident here would be entitled to a Citizen's 
                      Income. European Union citizens living here are allowed 
                      on the electoral register and are entitled to a variety 
                      of existing benefits and would presumably receive a Citizen's 
                      Income. (28)<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                      good reason for considering a link between the electoral 
                      register and a Citizen's Income is that legislation for 
                      a Citizen's Income would need voter support, and to link 
                      receipt of a Citizen's Income to the electoral register 
                      might achieve this as it would clearly link rights to a 
                      Citizen's Income to the fulfilment of duties (and especially 
                      to the duty to vote) as well as to the receipt of rights 
                      (and especially to the right to vote). (29) A Citizen's 
                      Income would encourage an active citizenship, and to link 
                      its payment to the electoral register would make this point 
                      plain.<br>
                      But such a link would not of itself determine who should 
                      receive a Citizen's Income. One possibility is to model 
                      the criterion for receipt on that for receipt of Child Benefit. 
                      (30) Just as a Citizen's Income is a comprehensible and 
                      simple payment, so surely the definition of who gets it 
                      should be comprehensible and simple - which rather suggests 
                      a rule such as that for Child Benefit, i.e., anyone who 
                      has been in the country for 26 weeks during the past year. 
                      This might give entitlement to some people who perhaps ought 
                      not to receive a Citizen's Income (such as foreign students), 
                      but it might be better to pay the Citizen's Income to them 
                      rather than to exclude them and at the same time create 
                      a tangle of regulations or a playground for discretion. 
                      If all of those in receipt of Citizen's Income were permitted 
                      to seek employment then the tax paid would in most cases 
                      repay the Citizen's Income.<br>

                      be considered either separately or together (with the 26-weeks

                      set of regulations is eventually chosen to determine who 
                      should receive a Citizen's Income, the establishment of 
                      a Citizen's Income would create a clearer boundary for the 
                      citizenry (and given that this is the case, the Citizen's 
                      Income should probably be paid to all those who are currently 
                      regarded as British citizens but who don't live here). Citizenship 
                      is, according to Goodin, &quot;a social creation, constituted 
                      out of symbols of one sort or another,&quot; (31) so a welfare 
                      entitlement creates citizenship, both because it is an economic 
                      right of citizenship and because it is a set of symbols 
                      - and this would be particularly the case with a universal 
                      and unconditional income, for it would create a new social 
                      solidarity, even if the amount of the Citizen's Income were

                      the possibility that citizenship rights, by granting greater 
                      autonomy to the individual, might destroy the fabric of 
                      society needed to underpin those rights. (32) A Citizen's 
                      Income would not have this effect, for by being a universal 
                      and unconditional income - however small - it would deliver 
                      social solidarity and thus contribute positively to the 
                      necessary foundation for other civil, political, social

                      well as making citizenship rights more diverse and more 
                      secure, a Citizen's Income might offer a realistic prospect 
                      that citizenship duties which are now difficult to fulfil 
                      would be easier to fulfil. By ameliorating to some extent 
                      the poverty and unemployment traps (and these still exist 
                      under the new Tax Credits regime), a Citizen's Income would 
                      encourage people to take employment - and particularly self- 
                      and part-time employment. The labour market would diversify, 
                      and it would be more likely that someone would find the 
                      kind of employment which would enable them to fulfil their 
                      obligations to their family (33) and to their community 
                      as well as the obligation to work for a living. With a Citizen's 
                      Income, the duty to work could mean less paid employment 
                      and more unpaid work: work in the family and in the community; 
                      and a Citizen's Income, by recognising the importance of 
                      unpaid work, might encourage the measurement of such work 
                      and thus encourage the doing of it. In particular, by increasing 
                      someone's ability to accept part-time employment rather 
                      than full-time employment, a Citizen's Income would make 
                      it easier for both women and men to fulfil their parental 
                      duties towards their children.<br>

                      excluded from the paid labour market, but who are able to

                      such as the right to vote, to equality before the law, to 
                      possession of a passport. It is also about social rights 
                      such as the right to adequate income, to meaningful work, 
                      to participation in society.&quot; (34) They recognise that 
                      in the past these rights were mainly delivered via full 
                      employment, but that that is now unlikely to be the case 
                      - and that a Citizen's Income might now provide a certain 
                      amount of economic security in order to combat the social 
                      exclusion which will inevitably follow the loss of full 
                      employment. They also believe - probably correctly - that 
                      a Citizen's Income, by somewhat uncoupling a full-time job 
                      from income, (35) would contribute to a redefinition of 
                      'work' as &quot;anything one does that contributes to the 
                      development of one's self, one's community or the wider 
                      society.&quot; (36) Thus a Citizen's Income would create 
                      rights both to income and to work.<br>

                      but it will no longer be a vehicle for rights to these social 
                      necessities - which is why Fred Twine believes that &quot;the 
                      concept of social interdependence ... provides a powerful 
                      rationale for a [Citizen's] Income as a means of sharing 
                      in industrial societies where people are dependent upon

                      who are permanently without paid work (because they have 
                      a severe disability or are caring for someone who has, because 
                      they are over retirement age, or because they are caring 
                      for the young or the old) with those who permanently or 
                      occasionally gain their livelihood and other social necessities 
                      through the labour market. At present there is little in 
                      the tax and benefits structure which unites these two sections 
                      of society. A Citizen's Income of any size would be a contribution 
                      to social integration for those necessarily permanently 
                      without paid work, as well as for those without paid work 
                      because they cannot find any. A Citizen's Income would thus 
                      contribute to the social solidarity we need if we are to

                      a Citizen's Income would have an adverse effect on the right 
                      to receive a fair economic reward for labour is a complex 
                      issue, but clearly an important one. Like Family Credit, 
                      a Citizen's Income could act as a subsidy to low wages, 
                      and it is possible that wage rates would fall if employers 
                      no longer had to cover the whole of someone's subsistence 
                      income. It is also possible that an increase in part-time 
                      employment and in low-paid employment would reduce the skills 
                      base, reduce the development of innovative technologies, 
                      and reduce employment rights generally. These issues are 
                      already important ones. A high-skill, high-wage economy 
                      has advantages for economic efficiency. Employment rights 
                      legislation and the National Minimum Wage are the routes 
                      to this scenario. By alleviating to some extent the poverty 
                      and unemployment traps, and by making the labour market 
                      more flexible, a Citizen's Income would make its own contribution 
                      to the efficient and just economy we need.<br>

                      for many people to pursue full-time employment, part-time 
                      employment or self-employment and to seek further education

                      citizenship idea. Her kind of citizenship is diverse, and

                      care, the content of what is purchased with an income is 
                      not prescribed; because a Citizen's Income, by increasing 
                      an individual's liberty, would contribute both to social 
                      solidarity and to cultural diversity; and because by imposing 
                      no cultural norms (as Income Support and Tax Credit regulations 
                      do by assuming the financial dependence of one member of 
                      a married couple - or of a couple living together as husband 
                      and wife - on the other), a Citizen's Income would create 
                      a society in which different cultures and lifestyles can 
                      relate to one another on a more equal basis and thus contribute

                      aspect of diverse citizenship is 'multiple citizenship'-

                      to localities and to the nation state - and to all of them 
                      we give different kinds of loyalty. Similarly, we all belong 
                      to the Continent of Europe. At all of these levels we have 
                      citizenship rights and duties, so we are citizens at all 
                      of these levels and not just at the level of the nation 
                      state. (40) It might therefore be appropriate to establish 
                      a Citizen's Income at more than one level - and particularly 
                      at the European level - in order to constitute a European 
                      citizenship and as a foundation for other rights and obligations

                      such a decision is required: Are we going to define citizenship

                      and then allow such decisions to determine the boundaries

                      that Child Benefit is still a 'universal' benefit ? And 
                      do they mean that Child Benefit remains a model for a Citizen's 
                      Income ?<br>

                      <i>Soundings</i>, Issue 2, Spring 1996, pp.193ff, suggests 
                      that duties are now higher on the agenda than rights, and 
                      that this diagnosis includes the Labour Party and the Commission 
                      on Social Justice's report. The Commission was concerned 
                      that a Citizen's Income is not sufficiently concerned with 
                      duties, and that this upset the reciprocity between rights 
                      and duties. If Lister is right, we might need to rebalance 
                      the relationship, and a Citizen's Income might contribute 
                      to this process.<br>

                      Eye to Democracy</i> (The Guardian/Charter 88, 1993).<br>
                      27 In his<i> The Common Good. Citizenship, Morality and 
                      Self-interest</i> (Basil Blackwell, 1989), Bill Jordan calls 
                      for active participation in decision-making as a vital component 
                      of the common good, and for institutions which will encourage 
                      this. He particularly mentions a Citizen's Income as an 
                      integrating instrument which &quot;would include the underclass 
                      in the same form of citizenship shared by all, and allow 
                      them the same freedom to determine their own level of participation 
                      and the same economic incentives as the rest&quot; (p. 124). 
                      It would encourage new forms of associations and new ways 
                      of creating public goods. We would add that this would particularly 
                      be true if receipt of a Citizen's Income encouraged inclusion 
                      in the electoral register, for it would actively involve 
                      people in decision-making. In this respect it would create 
                      a virtuous spiral, as opposed to the vicious spiral generated 
                      by the Community Charge, which had such a disastrous effect 
                      on democratic participation.<br>
                      28 In particular, the question of refugees will need to 
                      be tackled. It is unlikely that any government would allow 
                      those awaiting decisions on their refugee status to be entered 
                      on the electoral register, and recent legislation has restricted 
                      some applicants' rights to Income Support. There might well 
                      be groups of people not on the electoral register who ought 
                      to receive a Citizen's Income. Members of the House of Lords 
                      and those whose refugee status is still undetermined would 
                      be two such groups.<br>
                      29 Whether there is a civil liberties dimension to be debated 
                      is an open question. At present it is possible to choose 
                      not to be on the electoral register, and that decision has 
                      no implications for one's income. However, there would be 
                      no compulsion to receive a Citizen's Income or to be on 
                      the register, and some citizens might make this choice.

                      Research, 1987). This is a New Right and somewhat ideological 
                      treatment of the subject, but there is surely some truth 
                      in the view that where parents have more opportunity to 
                      fulfil their obligations to their family (in terms of both 
                      income and time available) the less the family's children 
                      are likely to end up in poverty. Novak recommends workfare 
                      (p.111). A Citizen's Income would have the same effect as 
                      workfare and none of the drawbacks.<br>

                      of 'paid' and 'unpaid'. See Sarah Blacksell and David Phillips,

                      the 1990s</i> (Volunteer Centre UK, 1994). During the 1990s 
                      30% of the 625 voluntary groups surveyed paid some volunteers, 
                      and 3% of volunteers were paid. The report concluded that 
                      paying volunteers is often part of a transition to fully-paid 
                      posts. <br>

                      Vilrokx takes the extreme position that full citizenship 
                      is only possible when citizenship's link with the labour 
                      market is completely severed. This is unnecessary. It is 
                      quite sufficient to loosen the link so that the labour market 
                      becomes one component of the right to income, the right 
                      to work, and the right to social participation.<br>

                      J.P. Gardner, on legislation relating to questions of citizenship. 
                      The author charts an evolutionary process of some complexity, 
                      particularly in relation to commonwealth citizenship. He 
                      identifies a general problem relating to obscurely drafted 
                      legislation. A Citizen's Income would be relatively simple 
                      to legislate, and would encourage a more general simplification 
                      of legislation relating to who is and who is not a citizen.

                      the credit is to encourage people to save and to build up 
                      private and occupational pensions by not penalising savings 
                      and pensions to the same extent as the Minimum Income Guarantee.

                      term 'informal sector' has been used to describe an extremely 
                      wide spectrum of activities, making it less than useful 
                      as a guide to policy development. This paper provides a 
                      conceptual framework within which to analyse different types 
                      of 'hidden' activities in order to design appropriate social, 
                      labour market, fiscal, and other policies. The author distinguishes 
                      between 'informal' activities (undertaken to 'meet basic 
                      needs'), 'underground' activities (deliberately concealed 
                      from the authorities), 'illegal' activities (generating 
                      goods and services forbidden by the law) and 'household' 
                      activities (producing goods and services for own-consumption).

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">A 
                      particularly important question raised by this categorisation 
                      of activity is whether it is possible to distinguish sufficiently 
                      between 'informal' and 'underground' activities. Many activities, 
                      deliberately concealed from the authorities, are undertaken 
                      to meet basic needs. Bernab&egrave; recognises the importance 
                      of the overlaps between the different categories (on pages 
                      37 and 38), but this particular overlap sector should have 
                      had a section of its own because of its size and because 
                      it has important policy implications different from those 
                      related to the clearly informal sector and the clearly underground 
                      sector.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Referring 
                      to Eastern European countries in transition, the author 
                      concludes: &quot;Having established a framework for analysis, 
                      further research is now needed to assess the welfare and 
                      income-generating potential of household, informal, underground 
                      and illegal activities. This will help to determine which 
                      of these 'hidden' activities should be 'formalised', eradicated, 
                      permitted, or even encouraged. The most ambiguous of these 
                      questions will be how to address informal activities. The 
                      answer will largely depend on the extent to which they are 
                      found to provide a social safety net and undermine government 
                      revenue. It will also depend on their potential for growth 
                      and on whether they contribute to a loss of human capital 
                      by deskilling what is a relatively skilled and educated 
                      labour force. Answering these questions will assist the 
                      formulation of policies that effectively stimulate growth, 
                      reduce poverty and strengthen public finance and the rule

                      families off housing and council tax benefit. It would enable

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      magnificent collection is a must for every welfare economics 
                      and general economics library - it's only a pity that its 
                      price puts it out of reach of students of the economics 
                      of poverty and inequality.<br>
                      The first volume opens with the editor's introduction on 
                      &quot;the elements of the modern approach to inequality 
                      and poverty measurement [which] involves the definition 
                      of an income concept, an ethical or other basis for distributional 
                      comparisons and a set of assumptions or axioms which give 
                      meaning to an ordering or ranking principle&quot; (p.xiii). 
                      The introduction is a model of clarity (as are the editor's 
                      lectures, which this reviewer once experienced), though 
                      a discussion of the meaning of 'welfare' would have been 
                      welcome, and a discussion of whether or not welfare can 
                      in principle be calculated would have been equally welcome. 
                      The paragraphs on 'welfare and inequality rankings' correctly 
                      recognise the diversity of possible meanings of 'welfare' 
                      - and in volume II Deaton and Muellbauer's paper 'On Measuring 
                      Child Costs' (vol. II, pp.317-341) recognises one particular 
                      difficulty with the concept of welfare: <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;The 
                      measures in this paper tell us about the effects of children 
                      on adult welfare, but they do not tell us about the welfare 
                      levels of the children themselves. Indeed, we doubt that 
                      household expenditure data in anything like their traditional 
                      form can tell us very much about the relative welfare levels 
                      of adults and children. One possible assumption is that 
                      everyone in the household shares the same welfare level, 
                      and this would enable comparisons of welfare or inequality 
                      with individuals as the basis of analysis. However, there 
                      are cases in which such an assumption would be clearly inappropriate, 
                      for example, in societies in which women and children are 
                      treated as the chattels of a dominant male. In such a society, 
                      it might be argued that only adults or only males should 
                      count in analysing welfare&quot; (vol. II, p.339).<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Arguably, 
                      definitions of poverty rely on definitions of welfare, so 
                      to develop a robust definition of welfare is an essential 
                      task, and one to which the publisher might one day devote 
                      a volume.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      papers in this collection are divided into sections. In 
                      volume I: the welfare basis of distributional analysis, 
                      welfare and inequality rankings, inequality measurement, 
                      inequality - welfare approach, inequality - structure, multidimensional 
                      approaches, polarization, and horizontal equity. In volume 
                      II come sections on the poverty concept and the poverty 
                      line, on poverty measures, on poverty axioms and rankings, 
                      on welfare, inequality and needs, on relative deprivation, 
                      on progressivity, on dynamics (i.e., on entering and exiting 
                      poverty), on functional forms of income and wealth distribution, 
                      and on statistical issues.<br>
                      There are historically important papers (such as Lorenz's 
                      1905 'Methods of Measuring the Concentrations of Wealth' 
                      with its characteristic curves), numerous papers and chapters 
                      from 1970 onwards, and a few recent pieces (such as Vallentyne's 
                      'Equality, Efficiency and the Priority of the Worse-off').

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It 
                      is of course impossible to comment in detail in a short 
                      review such as this on the seventy-one papers included in 
                      these two volumes, except to say that they seem to this 
                      reviewer to address the important issues and to be precisely 
                      the kind of papers which a student of welfare economics 
                      will require. There is a name index, but not a subject index, 
                      which is a pity, as these two volumes will be a valuable 
                      resource for both students and their teachers and a subject 
                      index would have made the collection more usable.<br>
