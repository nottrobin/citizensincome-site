                      Citizen's Income Trust is a charitable trust with a single 
                      object: &quot;to advance public education about the national 
                      economic and social effects and influences of Basic Income 
                      Systems (defined here as schemes which guarantee to each 
                      and every man woman and child the unconditional right to 
                      an independent income).&quot; But 'the public' is rather 
                      a large group of people, so the Trust's trustees recently 
                      agreed a strategy to educate current and future opinion-formers 
                      in the hope that this will in turn advance public education. 
                      As a first step we have undertaken a survey of MPs' views 
                      on the reform of social security benefits, and in this issue 
                      we publish the results of that survey. <br>
                      We believe that our readers would be interested in current 
                      debate on a Citizen's Pension (a universal and unconditional 
                      retirement pension), so we include a report on the recent 
                      Liberal Democrat conference, and, for those readers with 
                      access to the internet, we have added a page to our website 
                      dedicated to the Citizen's Pension debate.<br>

                      order to educate UK opinion we also keep in touch with debate 
                      in other parts of the world, and this issue includes an 
                      article on the Basic Income network in the USA and another 
                      on the recent Basic Income European Network congress. <br>

                      newsletter contains the usual news items and book reviews 
                      (a fraction of what we could have included). It also contains 
                      the results of a research project seeking for a revenue-neutral 
                      Citizen's Income scheme which would redistribute towards 
                      the lower earnings deciles, minimally to or from the middle 
                      deciles, and minimally from the higher deciles. This is 
                      precisely the kind of information which would be required 
                      by a Royal Commission if ever one were to be set up to study 
                      the future of income maintenance. </font><br>

                      of changes to the tax and benefits system on people's net 
                      incomes. For the purposes of this exercise only revenue-neutral 
                      possibilities were considered, i.e., so that the changes 
                      create neither a net gain nor a net loss to the exchequer; 
                      and only schemes which require the minimum of administrative 
                      change were considered in order to facilitate an easy transition.

                      means-tested and National Insurance benefits are left as

                      income is redistributed from people in the higher income 
                      deciles and towards those in the lower deciles, with high

                      low percentage decreases for those in the higher deciles. 
                      This kind of redistribution will not affect the lifestyles 
                      of the wealthy overmuch, it will leave middle-income individuals 
                      and families in much the same position as they are in now, 
                      and it will considerably increase the incomes of the poorest 
                      sections of the community - and it will achieve this whilst 
                      not deepening the poverty or unemployment traps. Because 
                      every individual and household will receive a greater proportion 
                      of their income as non-withdrawable cash payments, those 
                      in the lower earnings deciles will experience lower withdrawal 
                      rates and thus a greater incentive to increase their earned 
                      income. </font></p>

                      Liberal Democrats conference in September 2004 adopted a 
                      new pensions policy. I was a member of the group which wrote 
                      the policy paper which the conference debated and approved.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      main feature of this policy is a state pension for everyone 
                      over 75 who meets residence requirements at the level of 
                      the Pension Credit (currently &pound;105.45 per week for 
                      single people) without any dependence on means-testing or 
                      contribution records. The Party has proclaimed this as a 
                      Citizen's Pension, but it is not one because it depends 
                      on marital status and only &pound;160.95 would currently 
                      be paid weekly to married couples unless each partner has 
                      a contribution record entitling them to a full or almost 
                      full pension. This pension, like the Guarantee Credit now, 
                      would rise each year in line with average earnings. The 
                      precise residence requirement was not defined but it was 
                      suggested during drafting that this should be residence 
                      for either 20 years since age 25 or 10 of the 20 years before 
                      pension age in the UK or a country with which we had reciprocal 
                      arrangements. Those who had been resident for shorter times 
                      would receive pro rata pensions.<br>

                      conference resolution proposed that this should take effect 
                      in the first full year after the General Election but this 
                      is not feasible. It is essential to obtain all-Party consensus 
                      for such a long-term change and this, involving a draft 
                      Bill in one session before a final Bill in the next, and 
                      the time necessary for robust implementation of the computer 
                      system, would make April 2008 the earliest possible implementation 
                      date.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      net cost of this policy change, allowing for benefit expenditure 
                      saved, has been estimated at &pound;3.2 billion per year. 
                      Liberal Democrats say that this could be met from their 
                      policy of dismantling the Department of Trade and Industry 
                      and eliminating some of the subsidies it administers. It 
                      was also suggested that we should use some of the &pound;11 
                      billion per year paid in contracted-out rebates. With many 
                      defined benefit schemes being closed to new members and 
                      some collapsing altogether, this level of expenditure has 
                      probably decreased already and I suspect that some of this 
                      has been concealed by the Treasury when it reports tax yields, 
                      which are highly unpredictable. It should be actuarially 
                      possible to avoid increasing contributions to defined benefit 
                      pension schemes as they would have less to pay out to those 
                      over 75.<br>

                      Democrats intend that this 'Citizen's Pension' should be 
                      extended to everyone over 65 when this can be afforded, 
                      but no date was set for achieving this. 2020 would be a 
                      good target, as that is when women's pension age reaches 
                      65. By then all married women should receive the full pension, 
                      which could largely be achieved by giving everyone a contribution 
                      record each year from now.<br>

                      over 75 who have no income other than the state pension 
                      and who go through the present hurdles to claim the Pension 
                      Credit will receive no more from this proposed policy than 
                      at present. If they have a little additional income from 
                      other pensions or savings then they will retain that in 
                      full, whereas their present Pension Credit leaves them with 
                      only 60% of it. The main beneficiaries will be those who, 
                      from ignorance or pride, do not claim the means-tested benefits 
                      to which they are entitled. Pensioners who are above the 
                      range of means-testing will also benefit considerably. I 
                      have suggested for many years that some of this should be 
                      clawed back by higher taxation of the richer pensioners. 
                      The method I propose is that, instead of just phasing out 
                      the additional personal income tax allowance for older people, 
                      they should also be taxed at 33% instead of 22% on all income 
                      (up to the higher rate threshold) above the threshold at 
                      which withdrawal of the additional personal allowance begins.<br>

                      pensions would only be made to the extent that they exceeded 
                      the new basic pension when calculated with reference to

                      , would be encouraged. It was recognised that it would probably 
                      become necessary to raise pension age but it was decided 
                      that this should be determined by an Independent Pensions

                      from using their capital and then claiming means-tested 
                      benefits. With no one over 75 needing means-tested benefits

                      It comprises a large site with many interesting exhibition

                      BIEN Congress comprised one of six dialogues under this 
                      umbrella, entitled 'The Right to a Basic Income: Egalitarian 
                      Democracy'. The BIEN programme covered the 19th and 20th 
                      of September, but delegates were entitled to attend other 
                      dialogues and plenary sessions as well as the BIEN ones.

                      was estimated that about 1,200 people attended the overall

                      or all, of the BIEN programme. This made it the largest 
                      BIEN Congress yet. Some of the expansion came from European 
                      representation, but even more came from an expansion into 
                      the rest of the world. In fact, one of the exciting developments 
                      for BIEN came at the end of the two-day programme, when 
                      its General Assembly voted to change its name from 'Basic 
                      Income European Network' to 'Basic Income Earth Network', 
                      and changed its statutes appropriately to its going global. 
                      In fact, BIEN now has 11 national networks affiliated to 
                      it, including CIT, but also including networks from Argentina, 
                      Austria, Brazil, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands,

                      speakers talking to the whole congress, and parallel sessions, 
                      where organisers had put together four sessions running 
                      in parallel, each with four speakers and a chairman. In 
                      all the sessions, there were many willing speakers and their 
                      presentation time was limited to anything between 12 and 
                      20 minutes, although some took longer than their allotted 
                      slot, and time-keeping by chair persons, except in a few 
                      cases, was rather slack, which was a shame. Speakers who 
                      managed to produce a final draft of their paper by the 31st 
                      of July had it included on a CD of papers entitled Forum

                      the middle-aged, or the elderly, that bring about change, 
                      but the anger and hope of youth', 'In feudal times, control 
                      of the land was the method by which the rich used poor people, 
                      in the industrial era it was the means of production, now 
                      with financial capitalism it is consumerism', 'we need to 
                      insist that the debate is on our own terms, not on those 
                      of our protagonists', 'we want a society which offers time 
                      and security to its members, not the current anxiety and 
                      stress', 'we associate Basic Income with happiness, tolerance, 
                      altruism, social responsibility, and solid productivity 
                      with reduced working time. Basic Income is part of a strategy 
                      for the good society'. At one stage, it was reported, I 
                      cannot remember by whom, that in a recent survey, Americans 
                      had voted overwhelmingly for a Basic Income - for Iraqis,

                      the introductory session, there followed an opening plenary 
                      session entitled &quot;The Basic Challenges in the justification 
                      of Basic Income&quot;. It included three papers of excellent 
                      academic merit, which managed to offend different sectors 
                      of the audience. The first was by Professor Stuart White 
                      of Oxford University (who is no stranger to CIT), who spoke 
                      on the &quot;Right to Basic Income and the Duty of Reciprocity&quot;. 
                      Reciprocity in this context is the mutual exchange that 
                      takes place between individuals, and is based on a concept 
                      of private property rights and a given initial distribution 
                      of those rights. Reciprocity as a justification for Basic 
                      Income is an argument that most Basic Income aficionados 
                      rejected way back in the 1980s, in favour of justification 
                      by the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, where 
                      the reciprocity is between society and its members, whilst 
                      some others favour justification based on needs. It felt 
                      like a retrograde step to rehearse these old arguments again. 
                      (Maybe at future congresses sessions should be set up as 
                      debates so that differing views about justification for 
                      Basic Income can be expressed and argued over).<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                      was followed by a paper by Professor Dr. Angelika Krebs 
                      from Basel University, entitled &quot;Caring for Life: Parental 
                      Care, Work and Basic Income&quot;. Dr. Krebs was looking 
                      at two arguments, either of which might recognise parental 
                      care work, with financial support from childless people. 
                      One was Human Capital theory and the other was called the 
                      Filial Debt theory. Dr. Krebs carefully examined each theory 
                      in turn and clearly endorsed the human capital argument. 
                      She said that although the filial debt argument is riddled 
                      with problems, it is still worth further probing. There 
                      was a sharp intake of breathe when she was asked whether 
                      her definition of work included unpaid work, as well as 
                      paid employment, and she replied, No, no. She specifically 
                      excluded unpaid work from her definition of work. The recognition 
                      of unpaid work as work is a sensitive issue for many women, 
                      and she immediately alienated some of the women in the audience.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One 
                      might imagine that no one could possibly offend anyone to 
                      any greater extent, but that would not have allowed for 
                      Professor Gosta Esping-Andersen, a Danish academic of impeccable 
                      international reputation, who is at the pinnacle of his 
                      discipline of sociology. His paper was about &quot;Basic 
                      Income and the Family-Friendly Welfare State&quot;. He acknowledged 
                      that studies have shown that taking five years out of the 
                      labour market in order to care for children can lead to 
                      a 30% lower lifetime income, compared with those who do 
                      not take time out. However, it soon became apparent that 
                      Prof Esping-Andersen was not in favour of basic income as 
                      a solution to this problem. He was not in favour of mothers-with-care 
                      receiving autonomous income for so doing, because the better 
                      educated ones might exercise their choices and pay for care, 
                      and earn high salaries, and this would increase the inequalities 
                      between high- and low-income families. (NB. These inequalities 
                      could be ironed out by progressive taxation policies.) Basic 
                      Income aficionados tend to dwell on individual rights, which 
                      offer women more autonomy, rather than household compensations 
                      where women's autonomy is sacrificed. In fact, Professor 
                      Esping-Andersen did not want parents to stay at home raising 
                      their children at all, but to join the labour market, and 
                      he claimed that the children of low- or no-income women 
                      were better off spending time away from their parents, because 
                      they are too inadequate as parents, and the children should 
                      spend their days in nurseries, because the staff would be 
                      better qualified. This statement immediately enraged a significant 
                      proportion of the women present, but there was very little 
                      time for questions to challenge these views, or to ask for 
                      the empirical evidence, which could support such claims. 
                      Needless to say, many women were left reeling.<br>

                      last two papers were meant to meet the request from two 
                      years ago for a plenary on &quot;Basic Income and Care-Givers&quot;. 
                      They were given by academics of excellent reputation, and 
                      not by people with experience of long-term care-giving. 
                      Academic papers on philosophy have a role to play in justifying 
                      the provision of a basic income system, but most of those 
                      attending the Congress already know why they support Basic 
                      Income, and want to know the strategies and practicalities 
                      of how to get it implemented. This session should have focussed 
                      on the experience and concerns of long-term unpaid care-givers, 
                      and examined what a Basic Income would have to do to meet 
                      their needs.<br>

                      improved significantly after this. In one of the later plenary 
                      sessions, on &quot;The prospects for Basic Income in Developing 
                      Countries&quot;, Eduardo Suplicy, who is a federal Senator 
                      in Brazil, spoke of the widening eligibility of parents 
                      for a modest child benefit, of roughly &pound;10 - &pound;18 
                      per month, according to their income, which has been made 
                      conditional on the children being vaccinated, that their 
                      diets meet certain nutritional standards, and that children 
                      aged between 7 and 16 attend school with an 80% attendance 
                      record. So, even though most BI advocates do not normally 
                      recommend conditionality, it is accepted that in different 
                      countries the route to a true basic income may be through 
                      hybrid variations. Suplicy recognised that extending a BI 
                      to all 181 million Brazilians was going to be a slow process, 
                      and railed against the gradualism, but he recognised that 
                      at least they had made a convincing and welcome start.<br>

                      and executive co-director of the Economic Policy Research 
                      Institute in Cape Town, spoke about how attitudes have to 
                      be changed in South Africa, and how the process of introducing 
                      new ideas goes from the 'unthinkable', to the 'impossible', 
                      to the 'undesirable', and to the 'not yet', before accepting 
                      the new idea. South Africa needs both a BI and job creation 
                      activity. She paraphrased Nelson Mandela, 'South Africa

                      Lo Vuolo, from the Centre for the Interdisciplinary Study 
                      of Public Policies in Buenos Aires, spoke of the unrealistic 
                      demands made on Argentina by international institutions, 
                      such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, 
                      which expected Argentina to create stable jobs in a formal 
                      labour market, when the country does not have institutions 
                      which are capable of doing so, and where for generations, 
                      in many families, there has been no tradition of working 
                      in a formal job. As a result, Argentina has one of the largest 
                      workfare programs in the world. He felt that a change in 
                      the macroeconomic policies of the international institutions 
                      was required. However, he added that it might be easier 
                      to introduce a Basic Income in developing countries than 
                      in a developed one, because they would be introducing it 
                      from scratch, and would not have to dismantle the machinery 
                      of post-war welfare states, based on social insurance and

                      the final plenary session, Philippe van Parijs, who has 
                      been secretary in BIEN's executive committee for most of 
                      BIEN's existence, and who has now retired from that post, 
                      recalled some of BIEN's history, accompanied by photographs 
                      of some of our younger selves. He recalled the prize won 
                      by The Collectif Charles Fournier (of which Philippe was 
                      a member) for an essay on Basic Income. The prize was presented 
                      to them by King Baudouin of Belgium, in Brussels in October 
                      1984. They used it to finance their first conference at 
                      Louvain-la-Neuve in 1986, and it was there that BIEN was 
                      'born'. He advised us not to lose touch 1) with science, 
                      which produces the evidence, 2) with philosophy, which enables 
                      us to keep ethically vigilant in policy evaluation, 3) with 
                      the grass roots, which provides both experience and the 
                      fire of indignation, 4) with the diversity of stages and 
                      circumstances, which demonstrate that hybrids may be acceptable 
                      on the path to a 'pure' BI system, 5) with political feasibility, 
                      where the 'Most Advantageous Yet Achievable' course of action 
                      may have to be weighed against the purist path. He reminded 
                      us that political institutions are not carved in stone and 
                      can be changed. Finally, we must not lose touch 6) with 
                      the limits of our resources, that is, we must beware of 
                      our eyes being bigger than our stomachs. He quoted Margaret 
                      Mead, who had pointed out that a few thoughtful committed 
                      citizens may change the world, and that is the only way 
                      that it does change.<br>

                      with greater freedom, an irresistible combination.<br>

                      U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network was founded in December 
                      of 1999. It is called the USBIG Network for short (pronounced 
                      &quot;U.S. big&quot;). At that time, BIEN in Europe, CIT 
                      in Britain and several other organisations around the world 
                      had been discussing the basic income guarantee (BIG) for 
                      years, but there was no similar group in the United States. 
                      This absence was a little surprising because it was in the 
                      USA where the movement for a guaranteed income very nearly 
                      succeeded in the early 1970s. By the late 1990s, writers 
                      in many disciplines in the United States were again examining 
                      BIG, often with little contact with each other.<br>

                      over breakfast at the Kiev diner in New York City. We chose 
                      the name because BIG works as a good generic term for &quot;basic 
                      income,&quot; &quot;negative income tax,&quot; and &quot;guaranteed 
                      income.&quot; Also, it makes a nice acronym and the domain 
                      name www.usbig.net was available. We began by contacting 
                      everyone we knew of in the United States and Canada who 
                      had written on the issue recently. That started us with 
                      a mailing list of only about 30 people. We took on only 
                      one goal: to increase discussion of the basic income guarantee

                      the next 10 months, we organised a seminar series in New

                      would spread the word about the seminars, new publications 
                      on BIG, and any news I could find on the topic. Initially, 
                      I was surprised to find that there is always news about 
                      BIG happening somewhere in the world. Whether it's a change 
                      in the Alaska Permanent Fund, a new bill in Brazil, a trial 
                      balloon in Canada, or a seminar in New Zealand, there's 
                      always something. Circulation grew quickly by word-of-mouth, 
                      and we now have more than 400 subscribers.<br>

                      and the City University of New York in Manhattan, we held 
                      our first Congress. More than 100 people from eight countries 
                      attended, including academics, activists, and students. 
                      One of the highlights was a retrospective on the negative 
                      income tax experiments of the 1970s. A half dozen of the 
                      original researchers gathered to examine the relevance of 
                      those experiments for today's movement. Several papers from 
                      the conference will appear as a journal symposium on the

                      Second Congress was held in conjunction with the Eastern 
                      Economic Association in March of 2003. Several papers from 
                      that conference have been collected for a special issue 
                      in the Journal of Socio-Economics which will be out later 
                      this year. Our partnership with the .Eastern Economic Association 
                      has allowed us to count on having yearly congresses for 
                      the foreseeable future. Following the Second Congress, we 
                      solidified the coordinating committee that runs USBIG. It 
                      includes Al Sheahen (publicity coordinator); Steve Shafarman 
                      (activist liaison); Michael Lewis (coordinator of the politics

                      Third Congress was held in Washington, DC, from February 
                      20-22 2004. Philip Wogaman, a leader of the guaranteed income 
                      movement in the 1960s and 1970s, began the conference with 
                      a reflection on the development of the debate in the 35 
                      years since the publication of his book, Guaranteed Annual 
                      Income: the Moral Issues. To him, the central objection 
                      to BIG asks, &quot;Is it moral to give people things they 
                      haven't earned?&quot; He argues that we all receive things 
                      we haven't earned, from childhood on. He points to the selectiveness 
                      of people who believe they earned everything they have, 
                      ignoring all the unearned advantages they have received. 
                      <br>
                      Other highlights of the conference included a discussion 
                      of the possibility of an oil dividend for Iraq, and the 
                      first meeting between the fathers of the first two basic 
                      income guarantees in the world. Governor Jay Hammond created 
                      the Alaska Permanent Fund-the world's first basic income 
                      guarantee-which since 1986 has distributed an oil dividend 
                      to every Alaska resident. Brazilian Senator Eduardo Suplicy 
                      sponsored the new law that will begin phasing-in the world's 
                      first national basic income in Brazil in 2005. Although 
                      both had fought for BIG for decades, they had not met until 
                      now, and their meeting was an emotional moment for everyone 
                      present.<br>
                      In addition to the Congresses and the Newsletter, USBIG 
                      maintains an on-line discussion paper series. Anyone is 
                      invited to submit a paper on the basic income guarantee 
                      or on the state of poverty and inequality. The discussion 
                      paper series now includes eighty-four papers that have been 
                      submitted over the last three years, and many of them have 
                      gone on to be published in major academic journals or in

                      makes a strong case for a basic income guarantee and has 
                      been extremely influential in political philosophy. He is 
                      the secretary of the Basic Income European Network (BIEN), 
                      and has been a leader of the growing movement for BIG in

                      United States, and we feel we have had some success in our 
                      goal of increasing discussion of the issue in the United 
                      States, although it is still a long way from being a major

                      Government would meet its target of reducing child poverty 
                      by a quarter between 1999 and 2004. In section 10, on 'Future 
                      Support for Children', the first recommendation is that

                      the findings of a research project on Britain's poorest 
                      children. The researchers found that paid work provides 
                      the best protection from poverty, but that &quot;policy 
                      must recognise that work is not possible for all parents

                      Households' transitions from having someone employed and

                      are cut back sharply as pay increases. If the combination 
                      of tax and loss of benefits is that you only get to see 
                      less than &pound;2 out of every &pound;10 extra you earn, 
                      as is likely to be the case, then an adviser needs to be 
                      absolutely sure they have included all costs which arise 
                      when someone goes to work. These include travel costs, costs 
                      of extra laundry and food, school meals for the children, 
                      and the loss of 'passported' benefits such as prescriptions 
                      and dental care&quot; (Working Brief, issue 149, November 
                      2003, p.3). The Centre recommends increasing in-work incentives 
                      by extending Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit disregards 
                      and raising the national minimum wage. &quot;Management 
                      of the transition to work is particularly difficult for 
                      many people returning to work and the assistance available 
                      appears in some cases not to be sufficient. Although Government 
                      has introduced varied incentives to work, and continues 
                      to pilot further incentives, people are often not substantially 
                      better off in employment than they were on benefits. More 
                      rapid and radical progress needs to be made if key Government 
                      targets are going to be met&quot; (p.19).<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Economists 
                      have long worked under the assumption that the higher the 
                      price of a good, the more suppliers will want to sell. But 
                      they are aware that, in the labour market, it is possible 
                      that higher wages will actually cause workers to supply 
                      less labour. When wages go up, workers find jobs more attractive, 
                      but they also have more income and can afford more leisure. 
                      Economists long hypothesized that at low wages labour is 
                      unattractive relative to leisure and that workers work less; 
                      as wages rise, labour is more attractive making workers 
                      want to work more; only at very high wages, when workers 
                      have satisfied most of their material wants, do they react 
                      to higher wages by working less. They call this relationship 
                      a &quot;backward-bending labour supply&quot; because the 
                      relationship between wages and the hours of work changes 
                      direction. Based on this hypothesis economists have expected 
                      to find an inverse relationship between wages and hours 
                      worked only at very high wages.<br>

                      has found that the hypothesis of a backward-bending labour 
                      supply does not fit the data for the work behaviour of the 
                      world's poor very well. Because most of the world is very 
                      poor, it does not really fit the global labour market. Poor 
                      people around the world tend to have this &quot;inverse 
                      relationship&quot; even at very low wages: When wages go 
                      down the poor work more, when wages go up they work less. 
                      Why do you suppose that is? If you want to have some fun 
                      reading this review, and perhaps make yourself feel smarter 
                      than a generation of economists, stop reading for a moment 
                      and try to come up with your own theory of why very poor 
                      workers might work more rather than less at lower wages.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Most 
                      economists have never conducted research in the world south 
                      of the Rio Grande and the Mediterranean, but even those 
                      who study less developed countries (LDCs) have had a hard 
                      time explaining this inverse relationship. Sharif cites 
                      a large number of economists between 1950 and 1980 who describe 
                      the behaviour of poor workers in LDCs as &quot;perverse,&quot; 
                      &quot;lacking ambition,&quot; and displaying a &quot;strong 
                      preference for leisure.&quot;<br>
                      But Sharif finds a much simpler explanation for the work 
                      behaviour of the world's poor: They are overworked. Most 
                      workers in poor countries have no other source of income 
                      than their job. If wages are extremely low, they have no 
                      choice but to work as many hours as they need to attain 
                      subsistence. If you considered that possibility, you have 
                      outperformed a generation of economists. Using data from 
                      the Indian subcontinent, Sharif finds that this inverse 
                      relationship &quot;is observed when the workers are found 
                      to engage in unusually long hours-an average of 72 hours 
                      a week-in physically exerting jobs.&quot; The increased 
                      hours of work at very low wages are accompanied by fewer 
                      hours of rest and reduced food consumption-signs of economic 
                      distress, not of a strong preference for leisure. Sharif's 
                      evidence strongly contradicts the idea that workers in LDCs 
                      have a strong perverse preference for leisure. Rather than 
                      having one bend, the labour supply has two bends in it. 
                      The point at which poor workers begin to respond to decreases 
                      in wages by working more reveals the point at which they 
                      fall into economic distress. The policy implications are 
                      clear; workers in less developed countries need something 
                      to relieve their economic distress more than they need more 
                      work at current wages.<br>

                      got it wrong partly because they are overwhelmingly from 
                      developed countries, where many workers have access to other 
                      sources of income and aren't as desperate for work as most 
                      of the world's workers. It's very easy to lose sympathy 
                      for people when we don't really understand their circumstances,

                      her new book the sociologist Catherine Hakim continues her 
                      research into women's choices and opportunities in the labour 
                      market and the family through the lens of preference theory, 
                      a model of lifestyle choices that puts the heterogeneity 
                      of work and family orientations amongst men and women at 
                      its heart. More specifically, preference theory takes issue 
                      with the assumption that policy should strive for a unified 
                      model of the family, which in turn corresponds to a single 
                      pattern of gender roles in both the family and the labour 
                      market. According to Hakim, this assumption underscores 
                      the lack of support for heterogeneous orientations and divergent 
                      family models at both national and European level (e.g. 
                      the European Commission's promotion of the Swedish model 
                      of the family across Europe), with significant negative 
                      effects. Contrary to the imposition of a single ideal model, 
                      Hakim argues that policy should reflect the fact that women 
                      (and men) fall within one of three broad categories: 1. 
                      a life centred on career opportunities, 2. a life centred 
                      on family obligations, and 3. a role in which women adapt 
                      or compromise at various stages in their life-cycle depending 
                      on the options available. Adopting a single framework - 
                      even if it is the Swedish, egalitarian one - means that 
                      at least some lifestyle choices are discriminated against, 
                      and that those women again need to subject their wants and 
                      needs to some externally imposed view of what is their proper 
                      role in society. <br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hakim's 
                      general framework has been presented in a number of publications 
                      over the past couple of years (see in particular her Work-Lifestyle 
                      Choices in the 21st Century, OUP: 2000). This book aims 
                      to develop further some aspects of the general picture, 
                      partially in response to challenges raised by her critics. 
                      The book employs survey material pertaining to women's life-style 
                      choices in Britain and Spain. Britain is considered a country 
                      that has been through a number of social and demographic 
                      revolutions that characterize a full-blown post-industrial 
                      (for want of a better term) society, while Spain due to 
                      its turbulent post-War past has experienced some but not 
                      others resulting in markedly different markets for female 
                      employment. For instance, in Spain part-time employment 
                      constitutes but a small share of employment on offer, compared 
                      to half the British female workforce occupying a part-time 
                      job. Likewise, there are significant differences in how 
                      women treat their wages: in Britain a woman's wage forms 
                      part of the household budget (in the case of black women, 
                      regularly the main part), while in Spain a woman treats 
                      her wage as personal money to spend as she wishes. Comparing 
                      the survey evidence of both countries, Hakim claims, vindicates 
                      her principal claim that in the future previously significant 
                      distinctions between gender, class or education level will 
                      become less salient ways of predicting behavioural patterns 
                      and will be replaced by genuine distinctions in lifestyle 
                      choices. In the final analysis, once the black box of a 
                      'work/family orientation' has been opened, it is preferences 
                      that determine what choices individuals make with respect 
                      to their work and family.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No 
                      doubt many sociologists or economists will disagree with 
                      Hakim. The fact that life-style preferences matter does 
                      not in any way exclude the impact of gender, class or education, 
                      and the present study does not offer the sort of empirical 
                      evidence that might allow us to decide one way or another. 
                      Hakim's research does show that we need to take preferences 
                      seriously in a mid-level analysis of women's behavioural 
                      patterns, treating it as a social mechanism. What Hakim 
                      shows, and shows convincingly it must be said, is that insofar 
                      as the three work/family orientations (1. a life centred 
                      on career opportunities, 2. a life centred on family obligations, 
                      and 3. a role in which women adapt or compromise at various 
                      stages in their life-cycle depending on the options available) 
                      respond differently to background opportunities and constraints, 
                      each ideal also requires a different type of institutional 
                      backing. Again, policy-makers must ask themselves whether 
                      imposing one family model upon a population with heterogeneous 
                      preferences for work and family life, in particular taking 
                      into account how countries across Europe diverge in terms 
                      of their particular mix of work orientations and related 
                      family models. Reading Hakim's book in this light suggests 
                      it conveys an argument against convergence of family policy 
                      across Europe that fits well with the burgeoning literature 
                      by G'sta Esping-Andersen, Paul Pierson and many others about 
                      the different policy responses to common pressures. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
                      are at least two problems with the anti-convergence argument. 
                      First, if preference theory is indeed a mid-level theory 
                      it only tells us half the story, the other half being about 
                      what if anything determines women's preferences. It may 
                      be the case that it is not simply political ideology or 
                      class or whatever, but Hakim says preciously little about 
                      what it could be. Until that question is answered many policy-makers 
                      might be reluctant to take women's preferences at face value. 
                      If we can learn anything from decades of feminist research, 
                      it is that domestication is a very real social process with

                      second point brings us directly to basic income policy. 
                      Suppose we adopt Hakim's claim that the heterogeneity of 
                      work and family orientations should be the starting point 
                      of family policy. What sort of policy mix does this entail? 
                      One way of taking this is to adopt a complicated process 
                      of many different policies that interact in such a way that 
                      hopefully they provide something for each group. The other 
                      way, of course, is to adopt a single policy that remains 
                      neutral between the different conceptions of the good life. 
                      Basic income supporters have always suggested that basic 
                      income was good for women precisely because it actively 
                      supports attempts at getting into the labour market as well 
                      as subsidizing ways of staying at home. Whether this neutrality 
                      is a good thing depends on how basic income interacts with 
                      other policies already in place, as well as things such 
                      as prevailing cultural norms or ideologies, but in principle 
                      at least basic income is as preference-neutral a policy 
                      as one is likely to find. If and when Catherine Hakim decides 
                      to pursue the policy angle a bit further, taking a decent 
                      look at the variety of basic income proposals currently 
                      on offer would make a lot of sense. In the mean time, as 
                      Hakim's views gain credence within the academic community 
                      basic income supporters should definitely be ready to take 
                      this research on board.<br>

                      level 3 Open University text shows, among other things, 
                      how modern conditions of work are shaped not only by de-industrialisation 
                      and globalisation, but also by welfare policies. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Three 
                      main groups of affected people are discussed. First there 
                      are welfare claimants, who under workfare programmes may 
                      be required to take unsuitable, low paid work which, especially 
                      in the case of single mothers, worsens the home-work balance. 
                      Second there are the many low paid, usually female, often 
                      immigrant workers who provide the front-line care in health 
                      and social care. Under 'best value', 'contracting out', 
                      and other 'efficiency' regimes, their conditions of work 
                      and relative pay have worsened, weakening any loyalty to 
                      their employers, impacting negatively not only on their 
                      own sense of job satisfaction but also on the quality of 
                      care they provide. Third are professionals who work within 
                      the welfare state. Under current regimes that aim to render 
                      them accountable and to drive up quality by imposing bureaucratically 
                      determined targets, these workers may find their professional 
                      autonomy undermined, leading to the cynicism and demoralisation 
                      that is the everyday talk of, for example, university and 
                      school senior common rooms. In addition, of course, there 
                      are the low paid workers whose take-home incomes are now 
                      augmented by the shift from out-of-work to in-work benefits 
                      - but the book does not examine this group. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">I 
                      was not convinced by one argument made about the third group, 
                      professional welfare workers. The book suggests their work 
                      has been changed in a way similar to Taylorism in which 
                      management identifies each stage of the labour process in 
                      order to use fewer skilled workers to perform most of the 
                      stages. Classically this is associated with the assembly 
                      line. It seems to me, however, that in professions such 
                      as medicine and teaching a rather different form of control 
                      is going on: doctors and teachers still have relative autonomy 
                      within the consulting room or classroom, but are burdened 
                      with a million and one extra tasks that have to be done 
                      if they are to retain their schools, hospitals and jobs. 
                      Alienation escalates: the product is no longer a young pupil's 
                      mind enlivened or a hernia patched up, but a paper trail 
                      of statistics that get absorbed into league tables and quality 
                      assurance documentation. The doctor or teacher literally 
                      loses sight of the product of her work, or at least of any 
                      product that is valued by the powers-that-be. This is classic 
                      Marxist alienation, but it is not Taylorism.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      book's overall message is dismal. In the name of a neo-liberal 
                      freeing up of the markets for labour, health, education 
                      and care, the consequences are more and more control of 
                      workers' lives and hence their families' lives. I share 
                      the authors' sense of dismay, which is why they really should 
                      have discussed alternative policies, such as CI, designed 
                      not to control but to maximise personal liberty. The lack 
                      of any mention of CI may derive from the book being about 
                      the relation between work and social policy as it now is, 
                      rather than about visions of how it might be. This is a 
                      pity, as it would surely stimulate students to think what 
                      work might look like in a society in which welfare benefits 
                      function to emancipate rather than to control. <br>
