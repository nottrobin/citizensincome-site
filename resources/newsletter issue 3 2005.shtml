                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During 
                      August there was much discussion in the press about a 'flat 
                      tax' ( For instance, in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on the 
                      19th August) a single-rate tax on all income. The idea has 
                      sometimes been likened to the Citizen's Income proposal 
                      because there is clearly a similarity: simplicity, and therefore 
                      both efficiency and transparency. But there the similarities 
                      end. As we showed in the third edition of this newsletter 
                      for 2004, a Citizen's Income will redistribute somewhat 
                      from rich to poor (and in the sample scheme outlined in 
                      that newsletter net income rose 26% for people in the lowest 
                      earnings decile and fell 4% for people in the highest earnings 
                      decile). With the flat tax proposals circulating during 
                      the summer net income would rise for people in the higher 
                      earnings deciles and would be likely to fall for people 
                      in the lower earnings deciles. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
                      there is a problem with marginal tax rates of 40% for high 
                      earners, there is even more of a problem with the 85% or 
                      more marginal tax rates experienced by people on low incomes 
                      (See <i>April 2004 Tax Benefit Model Tables</i> (Department 
                      for Work and Pensions, 2004): http://www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd1/TBMT_2004.pdf). 
                      Turning personal tax allowances into a Citizen's Income 
                      would go some way towards solving this problem. <br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      December 2004 the Joseph Rowntree Foundation held its centenary 
                      conference. The first keynote speaker was Professor Jonathan 
                      Bradshaw, who told the audience that the State provides 
                      more support for market earnings at half average earnings 
                      than any other EU country, and that in effect the taxpayer 
                      is providing a large subsidy to low-paying employers. <br>
                      This is because tax credits are reduced as wages rise, making 
                      it worthwhile to the employer, and not very disadvantageous 
                      to the employee, for wages to be low.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                      Citizen's Income would, of course, have a different effect. 
                      Because it would not be withdrawn as wages rise it would 
                      not be at all in the employee's interest for wages to remain 
                      low. The employee will always be advantaged by higher wages, 
                      so low-paying employers would be likely to see their employees 
                      going elsewhere, or improving their skills so that they 
                      could seek higher-paid employment, or going self-employed 
                      - because as self-employed earnings rose the self-employed 
                      would retain their Citizen's Income. Low-payers would need 
                      to increase wages to the market rate, which would be good 
                      for competition, good for the economy, good for skills levels, 
                      and good for employees. <br>

                      taxation</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      2000 a Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution recommended 
                      carbon taxation as a means of reducing the consumption of 
                      carbon fuels. (See: <i>Royal Commission on Environmental 
                      Pollution, Twenty-second Report: Energy - the changing climate</i>, 
                      Cm 4749, London: Stationery Office, 2000.) The possibility 
                      that such a tax could &quot;provide revenue for improving 
                      social assistance schemes&quot; (Meg Huby, 'The Sustainable 
                      Use of Resources on a Global Scale', <i>Social Policy and 
                      Administration</i>, 35 (5), December 2001, p.533) has of 
                      course been noted, and the Green Party would like to see 
                      both a carbon tax and a Citizen's Income. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recent 
                      debate on how to fund a Citizen's Income has concentrated 
                      on reducing tax allowances and means-tested and National 
                      Insurance Benefits rather than on new forms of taxation. 
                      This tendency has probably been driven by the feeling that 
                      one radical reform is difficult enough for people to digest, 
                      and that two would be impossible. A Citizen's Income, funded 
                      by income taxation, is a single radical reform, and carbon 
                      taxation is also a single radical reform. Combining the 
                      two reforms risks alienating politicians, civil servants, 
                      and the general public. <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
                      reason for the caution in advocating carbon taxation is 
                      that such taxes tend to penalise the poor. To increase the 
                      duty on petrol hurts poorer rural drivers more than it hurts 
                      wealthy urban drivers of 4x4s. However, such hesitancy will 
                      be reduced by a recent report, <i>Green taxes and charges: 
                      Reducing their impact on low-income households</i> by Paul 
                      Ekins and Simon Dresner (York: Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 
                      2004). This reports on a research project undertaken by 
                      the Policy Studies Institute and funded by the Joseph Rowntree 
                      Foundation. The report concludes that a combination of fuel 
                      duty, congestion charging and a car purchase tax graduated 
                      on CO2 emissions would reduce the use of carbon fuels, provide 
                      additional revenues, and not penalise the poor more than 
                      the rich.</font></p>

                      a discussion took place on the future of pensions in which 
                      David Blunkett, then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, 
                      suggested that as people are living longer there need to 
                      be greater incentives to save for old age and equally there 
                      need to be incentives to earn amongst the working age population 
                      because the wealth they create supports our ageing population. 
                      Malcolm Rifkind MP also recognised the need to provide incentives 
                      for savings and suggested that the Basic State Pension needs 
                      to be linked to average earnings. Steven Webb, for the Liberal 
                      Democrats, asked for a simple state system because that 
                      will enable private and employers' pensions to function 
                      more efficiently. <br>

                      The context for this programme's discussion of tax credits 
                      was the National Audit Office's decision not to sign off 
                      the Government's accounts because of the high proportion 
                      of errors made in the assessment of Tax Credit payments. 
                      Another element of the context is the considerable amount 
                      of recent discussion on the difficulties faced by families 
                      who have been overpaid and from whom Her Majesty's Revenue 
                      and Customs then claims back the overpayment, causing them 
                      financial hardship. Philip Vince, the Citizen's Income Trust's 
                      Secretary, took part in the discussion, and made the point 
                      that a simpler system, based on a Citizen's Income, would 
                      generate far fewer such effects. </font></p>

                      'Concepts of poverty operate at a fairly general level' 
                      (p. 3), providing a framework for definitions and measures, 
                      and shaping the meaning of poverty both for those who live 
                      it and for others. They also incorporate discourses about 
                      poverty - the ways in which it is discussed - and this is 
                      important; in this book, language and images are seen as

                      some overlap between concepts and definitions. But definitions

                      human dignity).<br>

                      of poverty are often confused with definitions. But they 
                      are narrower, in part because they can be applied to certain 
                      characteristics of poverty more easily than to others. Understandings 
                      of poverty derived from participatory approaches often highlight 
                      aspects - such as powerlessness or 'voice poverty' - which 
                      are key to the experience of poverty, but which are not 
                      usually captured well in traditional measures. As Ruth Lister 
                      says, 'to move straight to definitions and measures without 
                      first considering the broader concepts can result in losing 
                      sight of wider meanings and their implications for definitions 
                      and measures' (p. 5).<br>

                      seems straightforward, but is rarely clarified by other 
                      writers on poverty, and by itself would justify the publication 
                      of Poverty. But Ruth Lister also develops a theoretical 
                      framework for understanding poverty which manages to link 
                      redistribution, recognition and respect, and to bring together 
                      the politics of redistribution and the politics of identity 
                      as they apply to poverty. Her insight is that the politics 
                      of identity as traditionally understood in recent political 
                      philosophy need to be radically rethought in their application 
                      to people experiencing poverty. <br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="1">This 
                      is because the relationship of people experiencing poverty 
                      to identity politics is different. They do not want their 
                      difference to be recognised - as women, black people or 
                      disabled people might - but want to be treated as human 
                      beings of equal worth alongside others. But the demand for 
                      respect is nonetheless similar.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><font size="1">Respect 
                      is a crucial theme in Poverty, not just because of these 
                      topical theoretical debates but also because it is a central 
                      factor emphasised by people experiencing poverty when they 
                      are asked about their own experience. When we treat people 
                      experiencing poverty with disrespect, we are engaged in 
                      a process of 'Othering', which sees 'them' as different 
                      from 'us'. It is the responsibility of politicians and the 
                      media in particular to ensure that they do not encourage 
                      this process, as they have so often done in recent years. 
                      Whilst Ruth Lister draws on the work of others, in particular 
                      Iris Young and Nancy Fraser, the fact that 'othering' is 
                      increasingly recognised as a significant issue in poverty 
                      analysis is due to this publication.<br>

                      also manages to highlight the agency of people experiencing 
                      poverty, without thereby losing sight of the major structural 
                      reasons for the existence of poverty. These reasons include 
                      the network of inequalities (of race, gender, disability, 
                      and age amongst others) within which poverty is framed, 
                      which is given its due weight here. <br>

                      Lister emphasises the importance of 'voice' - the right 
                      of people experiencing poverty to have a say in decisions 
                      that affect their lives. And she demonstrates that their 
                      experience is instead often one of powerlessness - or of 
                      token participation which is insulting. This is where the 
                      politics of poverty is related to debates about citizenship 
                      and democracy, and cannot be taken forward positively in 
                      the longer term without setting poverty within this wider 
                      context. This book is a major contribution to that endeavour 
                      - and so should be read not only by students and academics

                      series of essays is a 'festschrift' in honour of the political 
                      philosopher Brian Barry. Its aim is to bring together the 
                      themes of 'justice' and 'democracy', which have tended to 
                      be treated in parallel universes in political theory, and 
                      to highlight the tensions that can exist between them. 'The 
                      central questions about the relationship between democracy 
                      and justice - or, more precisely, about the relationship 
                      between different interpretations of &quot;democracy&quot; 
                      and &quot;justice&quot; - remain largely unaddressed' (p. 
                      6) the editors observe. In their introduction they illustrate 
                      the potential interrelationships between the two using the 
                      examples of participation, personal satisfaction, public 
                      goods and gender. They then map out the possible patternings 
                      of these interrelationships. They suggest that 'the need 
                      for really hard choices between them arises only if &quot;democracy&quot; 
                      and &quot;justice&quot; become greatly at odds with one 
                      another; and the distance between them will deepen the nearer 
                      societies are to being truly &quot;divided&quot; rather 
                      than merely &quot;multicultural&quot;' (p. 14). <br>

                      though not all, of the chapters address the interrelationship 
                      between justice and democracy at some level. The majority 
                      of them are written by political theorists for political 
                      theorists and are not therefore for the fainthearted lay 
                      person. A few of the chapters raise wider issues, however, 
                      which may be of interest to Newsletter readers. In particular, 
                      David Miller considers how the principle of social justice 
                      might be applied to public goods, i.e. 'goods made available 
                      to everyone without charge' (p. 127) such as street lighting 
                      and sanitation. Julian Le Grand addresses the tricky question 
                      of voluntary social exclusion and Philip Pettitt discusses 
                      how to identify 'the common good'.<br>

                      only explicit references to basic/citizen's income are to 
                      be found in the introduction and in Keith Dowding's chapter. 
                      The editors argue that, although usually discussed as part 
                      of the social justice agenda, basic income 'might be seen 
                      as a way of fostering democratization&#133;A basic income 
                      can allow all people, including those who provide vital 
                      non-pecuniary services, to be seen as fully-fledged citizens. 
                      Basic income might be important to democratic arguments 
                      as well as ones concerned with social justice' (pp. 10-11).

                      is disappointing that none of the chapters uses the lens 
                      of gender as an analytical tool, not least as the editors 
                      observe that 'the interrelationships between justice and 
                      democracy emerge particularly strikingly with respect to 
                      groups historically denied both: not least women, half the 
                      human race' (p. 11). It is also surprising given that one 
                      of the editors is Carole Pateman who has done so much to 
                      contribute to gendered debates on both democracy and justice, 
                      yet there is no chapter by her (nor by any other woman).<br>

                      Labour was elected to government in 1997, it inherited a 
                      country that had experienced worsening inequality and poverty 
                      over the twenty years. Between 1979 and 1997 the proportion 
                      of households that were workerless more than doubled to 
                      16 per cent. From the start of the 1980s until the mid-1990s, 
                      the Gini coefficient - the standard measure of inequality 
                      - rose faster in the United Kingdom than in ten industrialised 
                      nations with available data (including Sweden, Germany, 
                      France and Australia). By the mid-1990s the Gini coefficient 
                      was higher (and so inequality was worse) than in any of 
                      these other countries except the United States. The UK also 
                      had the third worst record in terms of child poverty compared 
                      with 15 other countries. Only the United States and Italy 
                      reported a higher percentage of children living in worse 
                      conditions by the mid-1990s. <br>

                      with this deterioration a key test for any reformist government 
                      is how successful it has been in stemming and reversing 
                      this tide. So, has Labour created a more equal society? 
                      The answer to this question is the preoccupation of this 
                      edited collection. It provides a comprehensive and state-of-the-art 
                      picture of Labour's record to date which will be of value 
                      to researchers, policy-makers and students alike. Paraphrasing 
                      a recent election slogan, the judgement of the book is that 
                      while there are noteworthy achievements, much more remains 
                      to be done, especially on inequality. <br>

                      book starts off by setting out what it means by social exclusion. 
                      Kitty Stewart and John Hills in their opening chapter note 
                      that social exclusion became an important theme early on 
                      in Labour's term of office. In August 1997, Peter Mandelson 
                      announced the formation of the Social Exclusion Unit that 
                      was intended to deliver 'joined-up' government by co-ordinating 
                      the efforts of different departments to tackle exclusion. 
                      Critics of Labour might worry that the social exclusion 
                      agenda is spin that is intended to conceal an attempt to 
                      exit from a commitment to address poverty and inequality. 
                      Stewart and Hills are more sympathetic to the concept of 
                      social exclusion, arguing that it helps capture the complex 
                      nature of poverty and inequality. They adopt an understanding 
                      of social exclusion that concentrates on employment, education, 
                      health and social and political participation. <br>

                      book charts progress in each of the above areas. When assessing 
                      the overall impact of Labour, the book rightly concentrates 
                      on assessing progress on an independent plane rather than 
                      seeing whether the government simply lives up to its own 
                      targets. Most of the chapters rely on quantitative data, 
                      though the chapter by Anne Power and Helen Willmot report 
                      findings from their qualitative study on the perceptions 
                      of families who live in poor neighbourhoods. One of the 
                      themes of the book is the plethora of initiatives that have 
                      been pursued by government. For example, Liz Richardson 
                      in her chapter on social and political participation draws 
                      attention to schemes such as Fair Share, Community Chest, 
                      Millennium Volunteers, Community Development Programme and 
                      the Development Fund/Volunteer Recruitment Fund. While most 
                      of the authors praise the government for paying attention 
                      to the different facets of exclusion, and point to real 
                      (though sometimes modest) achievements, they highlight the 
                      persistence of important problems and doubt whether further 
                      progress will be made without additional redistribution. 
                      Abigail McKnight in her contribution on employment notes 
                      that for working-age adults without children, the risk of 
                      living in poverty has remained constant for all household 
                      types between 1996/7 and 2002/3. Franco Sassi contends that 
                      a much more aggressive redistributive policy is needed to 
                      tackle stubborn inequalities in health. <br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      above evidence is supplemented by case studies of particular 
                      groups deemed to be at risk, looking at children, older 
                      people, ethnic minorities, asylum seekers and residents 
                      in deprived areas. Most progress seems to have been made 
                      in relation to child poverty, with Kitty Stewart noting 
                      that government spending on child-contingent support such 
                      as tax credits are up by around 70% since 1997/8, and early 
                      years spending on schools increased by around 80%. Stewart 
                      records that the government is on track to reduce child 
                      poverty by 25% by 2004/5. The percentage fall in child poverty 
                      is better than anywhere else in the European Union. Much 
                      less positive things can be said, however, about other areas. 
                      Tania Burchardt shows that the treatment of asylum seekers 
                      is lamentable. <br>

                      what does this all add up to? The volume paints a portrait 
                      of a government committed to tackling exclusion, though 
                      arguably more interested in poverty, especially child poverty, 
                      than inequality. The fact remains that while child poverty 
                      has fallen during Labour's tenure in office, income inequality 
                      has not altered much since 1997 (and on some indices, such 
                      as the gap between the very top and the very bottom, has 
                      risen slightly). Though it is not the book's brief to explore 
                      in detail the utility of different policy tools, it is interesting 
                      to speculate how further progress might be made. At least 
                      two things can be said on this matter. First, the evidence 
                      from most of the chapters points to the continuing significance 
                      of redistributive taxation. We might add that it is worthwhile 
                      examining the role that might be played by a Citizen's Income. 
                      Second, some of the chapters hint at alternative policy 
                      tools. For example, there is a glancing reference to the 
                      Child Trust Fund and more broadly 'asset-based welfare'. 
                      This approach looks to the stocks of assets that people 
                      own as well as the flows of income that people receive. 
                      These themes deserve further scrutiny, and such a study 
                      could build from the solid foundations provided by this 
                      book. <br>

                      is a book of four parts with the last shorter section concluding 
                      by looking at future challenges in the poverty and policy 
                      arena and the potential outcomes of current anti-poverty 
                      policy. Part one is an overview of the methods and findings 
                      of some founding poverty researchers, paying particular 
                      attention to the Rowntrees' contribution but also examining 
                      and summarizing some less well-known studies by female researchers 
                      and early investigations of rural poverty. It then moves 
                      on to look at the construction of poverty lines, making 
                      links between early poverty standards and contemporary measures,

                      begins the second part of the book by examining the origins 
                      of poor relief and the implementation and subsequent changes 
                      in government anti-poverty strategies and state support 
                      from the turn of the century to 1970. He notes that social 
                      insurance was the preferred policy method for the avoidance 
                      of poverty over this period. John Hills then briefly outlines 
                      the social and policy changes throughout the 1980s and 1990s, 
                      a period of burgeoning poverty, before exploring in depth 
                      recent policy changes and the consequences of these for 
                      different groups of people in poverty. He acknowledges the 
                      1999 pledge by New Labour to end child poverty but also 
                      the absence of any commitment to reduce poverty overall 
                      and the conflict between the government's initiatives in 
                      tackling poverty and inequality alongside their drive to 
                      reduce public spending. Although since 1999 selective increases 
                      in benefits have meant significant improvements in living 
                      conditions, many others 'continue to live on incomes that 
                      are falling in relative terms' (p93).<br>

                      three firstly examines the UK position on poverty relative 
                      to Europe and some major industrial countries. The UK has 
                      improved, especially in relation to families with children 
                      and low paid workers. Indeed, around half of the recommendations 
                      of the 1995 Joseph Rowntree Foundation's Income and Wealth 
                      Inquiry group have come about, bringing positive benefits 
                      to people in poverty. The book also notes however that health 
                      and wage inequalities remain large and that means testing 
                      is an increasing element of contemporary policy. The book 
                      concludes in part four by suggesting that a combination 
                      of policy avenues should be pursued concurrently, ones that 
                      aim both to prevent poverty and also to aid people, financially 
                      and otherwise, who may fall into poverty. The authors acknowledge 
                      that much post-1997 policy has adopted this multifaceted 
                      approach but that some 'gaps and challenges' remain. Unfortunately, 
                      though, their appraisal fails to look beyond the possible 
                      outcomes of current policy. This is a missed opportunity 
                      to introduce the idea of alternatives, such as the citizen's 
                      income, as a potential approach for addressing the complexities 
                      of modern poverty which the book charts so well.<br>

                      measures tell us how much has been paid for goods and services 
                      and how much has been spent on physical capital. The authors' 
                      view is that &quot;a comprehensive concept of consumption 
                      should reflect consumer preferences, and not be restricted 
                      to conventional goods and services; it would also be likely 
                      to include other 'utilities' such as leisure and environmental 
                      quality&quot; (p.1). (Why the quotation marks around 'utilities'? 
                      Leisure and a sustainable environment are utilities). &quot;Similarly, 
                      a comprehensive measure of net investments should include 
                      all capital formation undertaken by society and not merely 
                      changes in the stock of physical capital&quot; (p.1). The 
                      book is a detailed exploration of this 'national product

                      of the difficulties facing green accounting and green taxation 
                      in a world in which taxation is a national responsibility 
                      and pollution a global problem. Unsurprisingly, chapter 
                      8 concludes that &quot;even if aggregate consumption has 
                      the desired levels, green NNP in utility terms will fail 
                      on a welfare measure when the distribution of consumption 
                      is suboptimal. Therefore, a suboptimal distribution across 
                      agents affects the welfare measure in the same way as other 
                      market imperfections&quot; (p.147).<br>

                      Whilst the mathematical models might be detailed and informative, 
                      the real welfare economy is in fact full of much smaller

                      to agree European levels of social protection.<br>
                      Chapter 4 employs Esping-Andersen's categorisation of welfare 
                      states regimes and concludes that <br>
                      &quot;persistent poverty is expected to be lowest in the 
                      Netherlands because of its universalistic approach to social 
                      protection, next lowest in Germany and highest in Great 
                      Britain. Our conjecture is that a status-oriented welfare 
                      regime, such as Germany, is best able to absorb temporary 
                      income shocks. Such shocks are likely to be large in Great 
                      Britain, where market mechanisms play a more important role. 
                      For this reason, too, household and employment shocks on 
                      income are expected to be larger in Great Britain&quot;

                      5 studies income redistribution and poverty data for the 
                      Netherlands, Germany and Great Britain, and finds that both 
                      inequality and poverty (which are of course related, as 
                      a relative definition of poverty is employed) are highest 
                      in Great Britain. Chapter 6 studies the dynamics of poverty, 
                      for poverty is as much an inability to increase one's income 
                      as it is to be on a low income in the first place, and because 
                      persistent poverty is very different from occasional poverty. 
                      During the 1990s Great Britain is found to have had 50% 
                      more recurrent and persistent poverty than Germany or the 
                      Netherlands (p.156). The author hopes to see improved standards 
                      of social protection, encouraged by the European institutions; 
                      and chapter 8 identifies poverty traps as a particular difficulty 
                      faced by any attempt to improve social protection (p.208). 
                      An important conclusion, consistent with an open and flexible 
                      co-ordination of social policy, is that <br>

                      might be more usefully co-ordinated are the structures of 
                      social protection systems, for it is clear from the discussion 
                      of poverty as a dynamic phenomenon that the ability to exit 
                      poverty is the way to tackle it. So to co-ordinate a downward 
                      trend in deduction rates for people on low incomes might 
                      be a more useful co-ordination than agreeing on minimum

                      What is now required is a comparative study of deduction

                      types and housing tenures) across the EU. The welfare regime 
                      structure which gives the lowest deduction rates could then 
                      be recommended to member states - and the economic benefits 
                      of increasing employment, training and saving incentives

                      first conclusion is that it is difficult to find examples 
                      of unambiguous models. All the authors can find are hybrid 
                      systems. Generally, public schemes survive but are less 
                      than adequate, whereas private schemes are being extended 
                      to larger sectors of the population. The second and related 
                      conclusion is that private pensions have increased in value 
                      as well as in coverage; the third that private and occupational 
                      schemes are in some cases substituting for public systems 
                      (for instance, through the invitation to opt out of SERPS 
                      and into an occupational or private scheme) creating a closer 
                      link between contributions and benefit levels; the fourth 
                      that public pension schemes remain in place, especially 
                      in transition economies, and that in many cases we are seeing 
                      continuous change in the mix of different types of pension; 
                      and the fifth that occupational schemes are in transition 
                      from the defined benefit model to the defined contribution 
                      model. <br>

                      that income inequality in old age will increase (because 
                      high earned incomes can ensure larger private and occupational 
                      pensions) - though it is the detail which matters, and some

                      in view, for private schemes are regulated and subsidised

                      the carrot being the tax incentives offered to encourage 
                      companies and individuals to opt out of SERPS, the second 
                      state pension, and the stick the continuous reduction in 
                      the value of the state pension. The chapter starts with 
                      a thorough survey of pension schemes in the UK and of recent 
                      reforms, including the means-tested Minimum Income Guarantee 
                      (MIG) and the subsequent Pension Credit which penalises 
                      saving rather less than the MIG did; it discusses recent 
                      reforms of private pensions and the political economy of 
                      pension reform (concluding that it was easy to reduce the 
                      value of SERPS because it was fairly new and few people 
                      felt much loyalty towards it, and that reduction in the 
                      value of the basic state pension has been easy to achieve 
                      because it is only low earners who rely on it and they have 
                      little political influence); and it debates the risks and 
                      returns of different types of individual- and employer-funded 
                      schemes (concluding that the industry and government could 
                      bear more of the risk which pensioners currently bear). 
                      The chapter closes with a section on the investment performance 
                      of investment fund assets and a concluding section which 
                      outlines regulatory changes which might improve the performance 
                      of private pensions. The final suggestion is that pensions

                      argued. The book is an excellent example of good research 
                      leading to well-argued conclusions - except over this important 
                      issue. Maybe it was the publisher who wanted the title so

                      introduction. They shouldn't have done.<br>

                        British, Dutch and Swedish examples would seem to suggest 
                        that the hypothesis that 'the smaller the role of public 
                        sources the higher the level of inequality' needs to be 
                        qualified. The proposition holds under certain conditions, 
                        namely, when coverage of the occupational pension is limited 
                        to a small segment of the population and when public pensions 
                        have a low and declining replacement rate. The issue of 
                        the relative role of public and private pensions is very 
                        much on the political agenda of many countries, hence 
                        understanding under what conditions occupational pensions 
                        can reinforce rather than threaten objectives to equalize 
                        income and reduce poverty becomes important.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">George 
                      Miller has two convictions: that poverty causes ill health 
                      and early death, and that raising public revenue from economic 
                      rent of land and natural resources (i.e., from land's contribution 
                      to wealth creation), rather than by taxing wages and investments, 
                      is the way to fund the NHS. So this is really two books: 
                      one about health, and one about taxation. The 'health' book 
                      asks for higher 'welfare' provision (without being too specific 
                      about what that would look like) and increased spending 
                      on the NHS - though it isn't obvious (and the author is 
                      aware of this) that higher funding of the NHS will generate 
                      significantly less illness or significantly less early death. 
                      The kind of 'welfare' is of course crucial, because an increase 
                      in means-tested social security payments might exacerbate 
                      rather than help the situation. The 'taxation' book recommends 
                      the abolition of tax on wages and investment, and the collection 
                      of tax on the economic rent of land. Whilst a Chancellor 
                      might consider the latter proposal (for, as the book shows, 
                      there are good arguments for it), they are unlikely to consider 
                      the former, for to collect smaller amounts of tax by a variety 
                      of routes is easier politically than to collect larger amounts 
                      via a smaller number of routes.<br>

                      book is somewhat disorganised and repetitive, and is trying 
                      to do too many things at once, but the Centre for Land Policy 
                      Studies should continue to encourage debate on the taxation 
                      of economic rent. A particular issue on which they might 
                      wish to sponsor high-quality research is the Council Tax, 
                      which, whilst more like a tax on economic rent than was 
                      the Community Charge, is not the same as the old rating 
                      system and doesn't have the same effects. The business rate 
                      could also be included in such a study. After such a study 
                      the Centre might like to sponsor public opinion soundings 
                      on whether an extension of such taxation would be preferable 
                      to higher income taxes. Such an exercise would give them 
                      useful information as to whether their proposals for national 
                      taxation of economic rent would be likely to be pursued 
                      by any future Chancellor.</font></p>

                      'quality of life' or 'well-being' has increased is another 
                      matter. This book assesses established measures of well-being,

                      well in individually- and socially-determined roles is outlined, 
                      and income is related to these definitions as one of the 
                      resources required for high-level functioning. In chapter 
                      1 Wolff shows that in the USA the poorest have become relatively 
                      poorer since 1973 and that household debt is growing. In 
                      contrast, chapter 2 shows that inequality of consumption 
                      expenditure has not increased during the same period. In 
                      chapter 3 Jencks, Meyer and Single show that if a different 
                      price index is employed, and if per capita income rather 
                      than household income is measured (because average household 
                      size has decreased), then families with children have not 
                      seen their resource positions worsen. Chapter 4 pursues

                      Chapters 5 and 6 offer comparisons between the USA and other 
                      industrialized nations and reveal the relatively greater 
                      inequalities experienced by Americans. Only in the UK is 
                      the gap in real incomes between low-income and middle- and 
                      high-income groups greater than it is in the USA.<br>

                      important conclusion of Edward Wolff's chapter on recent 
                      trends in living standards in the USA is that sluggish growth 
                      in labour earnings hasn't been affected by substantial progress 
                      in educational attainment: &quot;Despite incredible success 
                      in reducing disparities of schooling within the American 
                      population, the inequality of income has not only failed 
                      to decline but has actually risen sharply over the last 
                      three decades. These results show a growing disconnection

                      reason for slow growth in labour earnings is a national 
                      income shift from labour to capital: one of the reasons 
                      for growth in income amongst the rich. So education alone 
                      is not the answer, and 'education, education, education' 
                      isn't either.<br>

                      Income Tax Credit, redistributing income through the tax 
                      and benefits system, and re-empowering labour. But the problem 
                      with the Earned Income Tax Credit is that it is withdrawn 
                      as earned income rises, so to extend it would extend the 
                      poverty trap. What is surely required is a redesign of the 
                      tax and income support system (p.23) in the direction of 
                      universality so that it reduces the poverty trap and enables 
                      higher earned income to result in higher net income.</font></p>
