                      The first payments were made on the 6th August 1946. In 
                      1977 Family Allowance and Child Tax Allowances were replaced 
                      by Child Benefit, payable to all families with children.<br>

                      Child Poverty Action Group and other charities are campaigning 
                      for higher Child Benefit payments and for younger children 
                      to receive the same amount as the oldest child in a family, 
                      which at the moment they do not (see www.makechildbenefitcount.org 
                      for more information on the campaign). As CPAG suggests, 
                      such a change would provide additional resources for larger 
                      families and would help the government to meet its child 
                      poverty reduction target.<br>

                      a change would also, of course, ameliorate the poverty and 
                      unemployment traps for many families with children, because 
                      Child Benefit is not withdrawn as other income rises and 
                      so provides a secure income floor for families trying to 
                      earn their way out of poverty. Working Tax Credit and Child 
                      Tax Credit cannot provide such a floor because they are 
                      withdrawn as earnings rise and the complexity of the system 
                      means that it is difficult to predict the change in disposable 
                      income which will result from a change in earned income.

                      addition to its role in providing a secure income floor, 
                      Child Benefit is efficient and simple. It is difficult to 
                      think of a better model on which the reform of the tax and 
                      benefits system as a whole could be based.<br>

                      August the <b>Joseph Rowntree Foundation</b> published <i>Flatter 
                      taxes: Rich giveaway or new deal for the poor?</i> by Donald 
                      Hirsch. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                      paper explores the possibility of turning tax credits into 
                      a negative income tax, with the consequence that across 
                      the earnings spectrum all earners will experience the same 
                      withdrawal rate. The final section of the paper describes 
                      calculations of what such a flat tax system might mean for 
                      tax rates, and the effects on net incomes. Researchers at 
                      the Institute for Fiscal Studies made these calculations, 
                      funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. They show that 
                      the main gainers from such a system would be families with 
                      children on modest to middle incomes, while the main losers 
                      would be the highest earners without children. Hirsch concludes:

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">An 
                      across-the-board flat tax may not be the best solution, 
                      and would be extremely difficult to sell to the electorate 
                      in the form shown here. However, the characteristics of 
                      a genuinely flat marginal rate at which income is recouped 
                      by HM Revenue and Customs serve to illustrate potential 
                      benefits of reform, which might be achieved in other ways. 
                      It is beyond the scope of this paper to explore details 
                      of other reforms that could achieve similar purposes. However, 
                      as a final reflection, it is worth noting that a universal 
                      rather than income-tested form of tax credits, with income-testing 
                      restricted to the levying of the main income tax on individuals 
                      principally through PAYE, looks particularly attractive 
                      at the present time. It would solve at a stroke the problem 
                      of the complexities and administrative tangles that have 
                      plagued our present system of tax credits.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      July the <b>Pensions Policy Institute</b> published an evaluation 
                      of the Government's White Paper on pension reform. The paper 
                      concludes that future eligibility for Pension Credit is 
                      uncertain and that between one-third and two-thirds of pensioner 
                      households might still be eligible for Pension Credit in 
                      2050, with a rise in the number eligible from around 4 million 
                      today to up to 6 million. Government estimates are at the 
                      bottom of this range. It also shows that even a very successful 
                      Personal Account scheme will not significantly reduce the 
                      numbers of people eligible for Pension Credit. But, conversely, 
                      a potentially high level of eligibility to Pension Credit 
                      in future threatens the success of Personal Accounts. The 
                      White Paper reforms do not provide the certainty of a solid 
                      state pension foundation for Personal Accounts, which means 
                      that UK policy is different from that of other countries 
                      with national savings schemes. The paper also compares the 
                      White Paper reform proposals with alternative simple single 
                      pension options (such as a Citizen's Pension) which, for 
                      similar costs, have a better (more progressive) distributional 
                      outcome and further reduce reliance on means-testing. The 
                      paper concludes: 'The White Paper did not include full evaluation 
                      of alternative state pension reform models or of ways in 
                      which a better state pension foundation could interact with 
                      a Personal Account-type auto-enrolment scheme. Such evidence-based 
                      assessments should be made in more detail to help develop 
                      consensus on future policy.'<br>

                      the debate on Citizen's Income [CI]. 3 Firstly, there are 
                      a variety of approaches, and secondly, that they are all 
                      problematic. This article introduces the thoughts of Zygmunt 
                      Bauman in order to demonstrate this point. His ideas are 
                      important because they expose the shortcomings and arbitrary 
                      assumptions that exist within the CI discourse. Bauman helps 
                      shake up and loosen a slightly concerning consensus that 
                      has began to emerge within BIEN [The Basic Income Earth 
                      Network]; a consensus that is preoccupied with advancing 
                      a CI principally on the grounds of affordability. Bauman 
                      suggests that this is not helpful in bringing a CI closer 
                      to political reality. The essential message that will emerge 
                      from this article, then, is that we need as broad a debate 
                      as possible. We need both the Bauman radical-utopian approach 
                      and the number-crunching 'feasibility' approach, although 
                      perhaps with a bias weighted in favour of the former.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 
                      get a feel for the different positions on CI it is helpful 
                      to develop a basic typology. There are several ways of articulating 
                      the differing positions that exist on CI. For instance, 
                      there is the distinction between radical reform and reforming 
                      reform. Nevertheless, this simple bi-polar model still leaves 
                      a lot to be desired. There is a need to develop a further 
                      typology that encapsulates the complexity of the positions 
                      that exist on the CI. This is not a straightforward process, 
                      because one of the significant problems with the CI is that 
                      it has been articulated in many different ways. However, 
                      one other key feature that helps differentiate the various 
                      positions is to do with the speed of the politics that is 
                      intended to be set in motion. Hence we can insert another 
                      line of reference into the conceptual model that I am attempting 
                      to develop (see Figure 1 below). In reality, however, CI 
                      theorists represent various positions in this two dimensional 
                      typology, though the majority are likely to be located in 
                      the top right-hand quadrant: the gradualist-reformist position. 
                      This is where Bauman comes in. He is concerned that the 
                      gradualist-reformist position marks the location of a kind 
                      of 'soft' consensus that has formed within the CI debate. 
                      Bauman wants to flip this trend over, so that the majority 
                      exist in the radical-instantaneous quadrant. By doing this, 
                      he thinks we have a better chance of advancing a substantial 
                      fully-fledged and global CI.<br>

                      typology helps us conceptualise these differing positions 
                      in a more tangible way. But obviously it cannot fully capture 
                      the nuances of opinion. For instance, a further fault-line 
                      across the movement could represent the degree of conditionality/unconditionality 
                      that a thinker advocates for a CI. Nonetheless, a typology 
                      at least gives us a more intelligible picture of the different 
                      tendencies operating within and on the edges of BIEN. <br>

                      most likely to make the CI become reality. But why does

                      argument is one that explores the tension between a position 
                      of instantaneity (i.e. we must aim for an immediate and 
                      unmodified implementation of income security measures; that 
                      is, a by any means necessary approach) against varying velocities 
                      of gradualism or piecemeal approaches. His concern is that 
                      the latter is vulnerable to hijacking by the political right, 
                      and it lacks the necessary political momentum to really 
                      put the proposal through. Thus he urges us to be more audacious 
                      and utopian. This, it is argued, will reveal the deeper 
                      (and true) potential of decoupling essential livelihood 
                      from employment. However, at present the proposal's potential 
                      is diminished because the soft consensus approach makes 
                      the mistake of 'selling it too cheaply' (Bauman 1999: 186), 
                      because its proponents are preoccupied with satisfying the 
                      standard view of what is regarded as feasible economically. 
                      Consequently, they make the mistake of 'offering it [the 
                      CI] to the wrong buyer' (Bauman, 1999: 186), therefore cutting 
                      short its potential before it has even had a chance to shine.<br>

                      the face of it, this seems a perfectly reasonable way to 
                      articulate the proposal. Surely it is logical to make use 
                      of the existing political notion of a social policy and 
                      the bureaucratic mechanisms which accompany this notion, 
                      as a means for transferring income more equitably across 
                      society. <br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Firstly, 
                      Bauman's concern is that the potential impact of the proposal 
                      is diluted if it takes the form of a social policy. This 
                      is because a social policy is invariably expressed through 
                      the rationale of problem resolution. The upshot of this 
                      is that, in the style of a self-fulfilling prophecy, the 
                      proposal becomes a problem-solving device, and, more worryingly, 
                      only that. As a social policy the CI proposal is in danger 
                      of being politically typecast as a measure simply intended 
                      to 'resolve the problem of the poor - to lift the poor from 
                      their poverty' (Bauman, 1999: 183). Clearly Bauman thinks 
                      the potential impact of a CI is much more than just its 
                      poverty-solving capacity. Ultimately, he thinks a CI can 
                      limit the risks involved in practising freedom by removing 
                      the 'awesome fly of [economic] insecurity from the sweet 
                      ointment of freedom' (1999: 188). Confronting poverty and 
                      unemployment is without doubt important. Still, the concern 
                      lingers that advancing the CI on this ground alone would 
                      pigeonhole it as a form of 'crisis management'. Expressed 
                      in this way, the CI becomes 'another &quot;one-issue&quot; 
                      and &quot;focused&quot; policy, fully in keeping with the 
                      problem resolution&quot;' approach of conventional politics 
                      (Bauman, 1999: 183). Whereas, if articulated differently, 
                      it could be a vision-guided strategy that transforms society 
                      significantly: <br>

                      the fact that it is difficult to put one's finger on an

                      can we assume that mainstream politics is 'motivated by 
                      the wish, or prompted by necessity 'to fulfil the obligations 
                      of the social state'' (1999: 184) as Offe assumes? Secondly, 
                      an argument couched in terms of necessity and poverty alleviation 
                      is unlikely to cut much ice with this group. Why is this? 
                      With the exception of all but a few nation states, national 
                      politics plays a largely supportive role to business. Today, 
                      conventional politics is not driven by an interest in resourcing 
                      greater freedom; it has discharged itself of any major concern 
                      with improving the human condition. <br>

                      entity that might have fulfilled these obligations to the 
                      poor - the welfare state - has lost a large part of its 
                      support, and the general assumption that it should assist 
                      the poor and needy is now in decline. The support of the 
                      social state for a CI proposal cannot now be expected. The 
                      idea that the welfare state should help the poor and create 
                      full employment was once genuinely an issue beyond left 
                      and right. Nowadays, it seems that the function of the social 
                      state is 'about getting rid of the poor; deleting them or 
                      making them vanish from the agenda of public concern' (Bauman, 
                      1999: 185). For example, the contemporary approach to the 
                      poor in the Anglo-Saxon world through 'welfare to work' 
                      (UK) and 'welfare to workfare' (US) results 'In a fast-shrinking 
                      number of 'people on the dole' and perhaps even a gradual 
                      evaporation of the morally painful issue of the 'dependent 
                      poor'' (Bauman, 1999: 185). This is useful to the political 
                      class because the poor can be brushed under the carpet through 
                      job creation schemes and the actuarial operation of 'shifting 
                      social wages to subsidies' (Bauman, 1999: 185). This makes 
                      it more difficult to 'detect the enormous social costs of 
                      the kind of modernization which is set in motion and guided 
                      by the price of shares and interests of shareholders' (Bauman,

                      thinks we must look elsewhere for agencies or organisations 
                      capable of translating a CI into political reality. This 
                      presupposes the construction of new global institutions, 
                      capable of intervening in economic forces that have cut 
                      themselves free from political powers. This would require 
                      a powerful globalisation of political power and the (re)emergence 
                      of enlightened and progressive social states. To some extent 
                      we have witnessed the appearance of just such a potential 
                      in the form of various world and continental social forums. 
                      In addition, we have also seen the logic of universalistic 
                      types of income transfer manifesting themselves in countries 
                      such as Brazil (i.e. the bolsa familia and bolsa escola 
                      policies) and regions like Alaska with the Alaskan Permanent 
                      Fund (see ILO, 2004, and also the Citizen's Income Newsletter, 
                      issue 3 for 2000 and issue 3 for 2004). Even though the 
                      major social states have moved away from universal types 
                      of social protection, it is conceivable that if sufficient 
                      pressure is applied their migration away from the social 
                      can be reversed. Hence, we can see the importance of recent 
                      global social movements. It is possible that action at the 
                      global level can resuscitate the political will at the local/national 
                      level to develop universal types of social protection which 
                      are loaded with capacity building qualities (i.e. with the 
                      capacity to resource and facilitate authentic autonomy), 
                      as it is argued could be the case with the CI.<br>

                      must demonstrate its feasibility in order for it to be realised. 
                      However, Bauman's insights here are interesting because 
                      he makes us realise that what is regarded as 'feasible' 
                      and 'plausible' are essentially subjective, contestable 
                      and therefore open to re-configuration. <br>

                      suggests that arguments couched in terms of 'affordability' 
                      willy-nilly imply the acceptance of the 'social-state' as, 
                      essentially, the transfer of money from those who earn it 
                      to those who don't' (1999: 185). These arguments inevitably 
                      involve an acceptance of the logic of contemporary welfare; 
                      one increasingly rooted in a capitalist context and a propensity 
                      for giving into the 'paternalist twitch' (Standing, 2002); 
                      which usually translates into the development of coercive 
                      and directive welfare policy that is wholly unsuited to 
                      improving the human condition and expanding human autonomy. 
                      The downside of the affordability approach is that it focuses 
                      on the feasibility of the CI within economic boundaries 
                      that have already been sealed. <br>
                      Surely, in order to advance the CI proposal as rapidly as 
                      possible, we need to highlight the arbitrariness of what 
                      is possible economically. Counter-intuitive though this 
                      sounds, arguing through the language of affordability may 
                      make the CI chances weaker rather than stronger. <br>

                      if the CI were to be ushered in under an accountancy-style 
                      form, it will not be free from future problems. The affordability 
                      approach 'will burden [the CI] with a potentially terminal 
                      blemish tremendously difficult to erase and will thus store 
                      up trouble for the future' (Bauman, 1999: 185). Rather than 
                      being a transformative proposal it will be consigned to 
                      a life of 'haggling and log-rolling' (Bauman, 1999: 185). 
                      If we condemn the CI to such a future we will have wasted 
                      many important opportunities to radically re-negotiate the 
                      nature of contemporary society, in ways which could be very 
                      liberating. <br>

                      the foregoing discussion does is to encourage us to think 
                      more deeply about what we mean when we talk about the affordability 
                      of any proposal. Affordability can take on the mantle of 
                      neutrality. We need to be demonstrating the opposite and 
                      remain mindful that considering the affordability of any 
                      given idea is not a value-neutral endeavour. Surely we should 
                      be trying to challenge what is regarded as possible economically, 
                      in order to create a political climate more favourable to 
                      the realisation of the CI. Bauman's desire is to develop 
                      a discourse that liberates economic thinking from its existing 
                      constraints, freeing up new possibilities for politico-economic 
                      thinking. In doing this we can cultivate a new political 
                      grammar that assists the normalisation of proposals like 
                      a CI, so that it sets in motion a cultural mutation where 
                      the CI just becomes common sense. Therefore, Bauman's argument 
                      is important because it articulates the potential of the 
                      CI in new ways. This might equip people with a new outlook 
                      and enthuse them with a renewed interest in the proposal 
                      and, thus, restrictive and obstructive cognitive boundaries 
                      are dissolved.<br>

                      is possible to argue that Bauman is wrong because he does 
                      not credit the soft consensus approach with the intelligence 
                      it deserves. The intention of the latter position may be 
                      to introduce a partial and watered-down CI into society. 
                      At first this might take the form of a conventional welfare 
                      policy, but as a long term strategy it could be used as 
                      a lever to promote a more substantial CI. In this view the 
                      CI would be a kind of Trojan horse, introducing an important 
                      principle of universalism into society. However, it is unlikely 
                      to be experienced as too disturbing to the politically squeamish, 
                      because it will not appear as some radical political shift.

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then 
                      again, introducing a CI as a Trojan horse could mean that 
                      it is easily co-opted and perverted by the system. There 
                      is no guarantee that a modified partial CI would automatically 
                      develop into a full one. It could easily become a wage for 
                      compulsory passivity or 'hush money' to keep the poor and 
                      insecure quiet. Hence, we return to Bauman's consistent 
                      argument that the CI must not be diluted. It must be articulated 
                      as a vision-guided strategy. Bauman's view would be: if 
                      we want a CI we should just make it happen. Perhaps affordability 
                      is more a problem of priorities. If a society wishes to 
                      make this egalitarian proposal reality then it should be 
                      given a sufficiently high priority in the allocation of 
                      public resources. Furthermore, if we cannot identify an 
                      existing agency to bring it into being, we must seek out 
                      other alternatives. We must not be limited by the 'reality' 
                      of the present. Clearly, then, there is a need to discuss 
                      the merits of Bauman's approach against others.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      main problem with promising a CI on the grounds that Bauman 
                      recommends leads back to the issue of identifying a 'who' 
                      or 'what' that can forward it. He recognises this and suggests 
                      that 'under the current conditions it is difficult to find 
                      an agency potent enough to put the idea through' (Bauman, 
                      1999: 190). However, this is only true if we regard mainstream 
                      political parties as the main agents capable of realising 
                      the proposal. For there are many other political forces 
                      such as the labour and trade unions; all manner of pressure 
                      groups, cultural and religious organisations and the radical 
                      unconventional political culture that has manifested itself 
                      by staging large insurrections in major metropoles in recent 
                      years, (i.e. as was witnessed in Genoa and Seattle). <br>
                      However, if we continue to consider mainstream politics 
                      as the pre-eminent means of putting through a CI we are 
                      of course faced with the major problem that the 'truly potent 
                      powers of today are essentially exterritorial' (1999: 191), 
                      while the sites of political action remain hopelessly local. 
                      If a nation state were to go it alone with a CI, it may 
                      well end up as a political and economic pariah. Firstly, 
                      to finance a substantial CI might mean the taxation of capital 
                      flows or super-income earners. In all likelihood this would 
                      result in this country being branded as troublesome. This 
                      stigmatisation could provoke highly destabilising capital 
                      flight and the possibility of economic attacks/sabotage 
                      by those agencies that do not look favourably on moves to 
                      create a more protected egalitarian world. Bauman therefore 
                      concludes that only concerted continental or global action 
                      can prevent such outcomes. Such a strategy might require 
                      the CI proposal to be linked up with other struggles. For 
                      instance, BIEN could explore the world and continental social 
                      forums as a possible avenue of change. Perhaps more of an 
                      effort should be made to connect and identify with the many 
                      groups that are encompassed within these forums in order 
                      to establish even more broad-based support. It is this point; 
                      along with the fact that we should defer less to demands 
                      for affordability that are the hallmarks of Bauman's important 
                      argument.<br>

                      of the CI meant to theorise with, other than the existing 
                      political structures? Thus the problem of a coherent organisation 
                      to advance the proposal still persists. There is no guarantee 
                      that such an organisation will emerge. However, we can observe 
                      the emergence of a form of politics (i.e. anti-capitalist, 
                      social justice and ecological movements) that might embrace 
                      a proposal such as the CI. This is because a CI can advance 
                      many of these groups' specific goals whilst simultaneously 
                      and diplomatically traversing the many political positions 
                      that exist on the radical left without necessarily forcing 
                      them to dismantle their worldview entirely. In a sense this 
                      is what Van Parijs has been appealing for. He has suggested 
                      that the case for the CI must be swollen and spread (2006). 
                      Would not connecting with these groups satisfy the latter 
                      aspect of this strategic assertion? Many different groups 
                      can sign up to the CI as a way to achieve their more specific 
                      demands. An economic right such as the CI could function 
                      as a hegemonic pole of resistance and unity - a commonality 
                      that connects these (dis)organisations in a non-totalising 
                      way - around which they can apply more focused pressure 
                      to change society. As George Monbiot (2003) has argued, 
                      these organisations are capable of creating legitimate global 
                      counter institutions capable of wresting political power 
                      away from corporate politics; a political context which 
                      would be far more conducive to a CI. Consequently, we can 
                      see that Bauman's assertion that we require a new global 
                      apparatus to establish a CI is plausible when placed against 
                      the backdrop of contemporary radical political culture.<br>

                      have demonstrated is possible. This still leaves room for 
                      political co-option, since conventional politics would most 
                      likely opt for the less troublesome and easily achievable 
                      version. Hence, it seems that Bauman's approach could help 
                      BIEN stretch political possibility beyond existing limits.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bauman's 
                      argument seems to veer towards the logic of political counter-modelling. 
                      Surely to bring the CI closer to political reality, we need 
                      to be using existing structures and agencies of power rather 
                      than displacing the avenues for political change, elsewhere 
                      and elsewhen to some as of yet unspecified context/entity. 
                      Although, this is perhaps a little harsh since Bauman always 
                      strives to identify existing agents who can make radical 
                      proposals become reality. Inevitably, all progressive utopian 
                      thought needs an element of thinking that can project us 
                      to a place that is 'beyond where we are now' or conceiving 
                      of something that is 'better than what we have now'. We 
                      should not seek to eliminate such thinking from discourses 
                      on the CI.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
                      it is important to critique the dominant notion of globalisation 
                      which frames the contemporary CI debate, we should not be 
                      too quick so surrender the term 'globalisation' to the meaning 
                      given by mainstream politics. We need to articulate the 
                      affordability of CI along new lines (i.e. social justice, 
                      equity, can we afford not to finance a CI (in terms of psychological, 
                      social and ecological costs) et cetera). So in a sense, 
                      perhaps we need to bend and tweak the debate on affordability 
                      in a more radical direction. The importance of Bauman's 
                      approach is that it indicates new directions in which the 
                      debate can be bent and tweaked.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another 
                      problem with Bauman's perspective is that it lacks an awareness 
                      of contextual diversity. For instance, a Bauman-style CI 
                      may not be a difficult thing to envisage for the Nordic 
                      countries with a history of a social state. Whereas, in 
                      a context where the social state is unheard of, other more 
                      gradual approaches might be more appropriate. Bauman's argument 
                      might seem a tad insensitive to contextual dissonance: the 
                      diversity of stages and circumstances that obstruct the 
                      political implementation of political proposals. What is 
                      possible in one place is not possible in another. Perhaps 
                      a more appropriate way to think about the degree of radicalness 
                      and speed with which to advance the CI is encapsulated by 
                      Van Parijs' MAYA principle. He suggests that political and 
                      economic feasibility should be based on the idea that we 
                      must aim for the most advanced yet achievable goals in any 
                      given context. This might be the best watchword by which 
                      to forward the CI. Having said that, Bauman intimates that 
                      a radical revolutionary CI in the developed countries could 
                      unleash a similar politics in the developing countries, 
                      especially if the developed countries start to see the sense 
                      (i.e. in terms of ecological sustainability, basic social 
                      justice and greater global economic security) in helping 
                      to extend this kind of social protection to other regions. 
                      This might occur in the manner of a feedback loop, where 
                      the introduction of a CI in the developed countries stimulates 
                      a cultural/attitudinal mutation more receptive to the possibility 
                      of a global CI.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Clearly 
                      Bauman is not in denial of the enormity of the task involved 
                      in implementing a CI as a radical measure to develop a protected 
                      egalitarian world. However, there are reasons to be cheerful 
                      and optimistic. There is clear evidence that nation states 
                      can change the direction of globalisation, though not if 
                      they act alone. There are also signs of a stirring radical 
                      conscience that can be observed in the recent explosion 
                      of unconventional politics. In this context, we can observe 
                      how the CI could be just the kind of radical proposal that 
                      these organisations are crying out for, since they seem 
                      to be searching for something to suture and galvanise them 
                      into a coherent, focused and more self-conscious political 
                      assemblage; one that is capable of re-configuring the social 
                      state and altering the nature and direction of globalisation.<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Essentially, 
                      Bauman sees a rejuvenated democratic political sphere as 
                      necessary if capitalism is to be controlled. Democracy is 
                      not possible if the polity is made up of insecure people. 
                      Thus his main argument for CI (Bauman, 1999: 182-3) is political. 
                      All the radical potential of CI remains as potential without 
                      a radicalised democracy. Therefore, it seems that one way 
                      out of this impasse, is along the same lines as are advocated 
                      by Gorz (1999) who suggests we need to develop a campaign 
                      for an unconditional CI (campaigning on the grounds of what 
                      can be called a Gorz and Bauman style) and developing a 
                      radical democratic movement at the same time. <br>

                      approach is important as it shakes up those norms that have 
                      developed within BIEN. It encourages us to think outside 
                      our comfort zones. And, crucially, one very important insight 
                      that Bauman brings to the fore, is that the difficulty in 
                      radically altering the human condition is not so much due 
                      to a dearth of transformative ideas but more a lack of political 
                      will and resolve. </font></p>

                      In his discussion of a citizen's income, Bauman actually 
                      refers to it as a basic income [BI], as so many thinkers 
                      do. Arguably, the term 'BI' is not that helpful in bringing 
                      the proposal closer to political reality, since its connotations 
                      are derogatory. Upon reflection Bauman would probably agree 
                      with this, since he argues that the power of a BI/CI is 
                      its capacity to promote a radically democratic society consisting 
                      of empowered citizens. The problem with the term 'basic' 
                      is that it always requires clarification: for instance, 
                      one finds the need to explain that 'basic' does not necessarily 
                      refer to the degree of financial generosity that is attached 
                      to the administered income, but more precisely to the idea 
                      that it is intended to address people's basic needs or a 
                      basic level of security. Hence, in this paper I will use 
                      the term 'CI'. <br>

                      forms of reform, such as a Citizen's Income, and to impose 
                      a burden on other parts of the policy debate. For if someone 
                      who reads this book now hears a Citizen's Income described 
                      as welfare reform they might assume that there are work 
                      conditions attached to it - which there are not. <br>

                      spectrum - though maybe the existence of a 'left-right' 
                      spectrum should not have been accepted as an axiom in the 
                      way that it is. The labels 'left', 'right' and 'liberal' 
                      promote the replaying of arguments which lead to the polarizing 
                      of entitlement and responsibility against each other, whereas 
                      either can in fact promote the other, particularly in the

                      chapter 2 Carole Pateman discusses a Citizen's Income, arguing 
                      that caring is as much 'work' as is paid employment and 
                      that to link social reproduction to gainful employment causes 
                      more problems than it solves. 'To solve the problem of social 
                      reproduction and the welfare of citizens it is necessary 
                      to move back to the universalism of democracy. I argue that 
                      an unconditional basic income for all citizens is a step 
                      in this direction' (p.37). A Citizen's Income thus becomes 
                      an 'enabler of full citizenship', and that is how it should 
                      be promoted, for 'if it is supported as a means to relieve 
                      poverty or a way to promote flexible labour markets, the 
                      suggested level is likely to be lower than if the concern 
                      is social reproduction and democratic citizenship' (p.51). 
                      It is consistent with her argument for her to say that Tony 
                      Atkinson's 'participation income' 'reinstates lesser citizenship' 
                      (p.54). Pateman correctly says of reciprocity defined as 
                      employment or other conditions that 'no such duty is demanded 
                      of other beneficiaries of public provision' such as the 
                      NHS (p.55), and that reciprocity does not need to be understood

                      it is intrusive, it stigmatizes, and it treats benefit recipients 
                      differently from those receiving other state-administered 
                      benefits, particularly in relation to the micromanagement 
                      of their lives by state employees. He also worries about

                      (p.87), and suggests that John Rawls's 'justice as fairness' 
                      assumes that everyone will take part in society's cooperative 
                      work. He understands that much debate about welfare is first-level 
                      debate, and that if a work-test has practical consequences 
                      (as King suggests) which compromise justice as fairness 
                      then new ways must be found to encourage cooperation by 
                      incentivising it rather than through coercion. He suggests 
                      that only if those who are wealthy through inheritance are 
                      coerced into employment can we treat benefit recipients 
                      in the same way; and that if coercing people into accepting 
                      employment at lower wages than those at which they would 
                      have accepted employment if they had not been in receipt 
                      of benefits then that's not fair and we shouldn't do it. 
                      He finds the New Deal for Young People vulnerable to accusations 
                      of such inequities. Whilst it is sometimes necessary to 
                      pay a price in justice for a practical policy, that price 
                      must be acknowledged: <br>
                      At the level of ideal theory, liberal neutrality does not 
                      exclude conditionality in the welfare system. There can 
                      be good, justice-based reasons for conditionality. In the 
                      much less than ideal circumstances of our own societies, 
                      however, conditionality - in particular, work-conditionality 
                      - will properly give liberals pause because it might well 
                      lead to inequity in the enforcement of civic obligations 
                      or to a consolidation of unjust labour-market disadvantage,

                      5, by William Galston, discusses various ways in which citizenship 
                      might be said to be conditional and in which citizenship 
                      might require certain conditionalities. He suggests that 
                      John Rawls' 'veil of ignorance' theory of justice (in which 
                      he suggests that people who didn't know what position they 
                      would hold in society would choose just social policies) 
                      leads to a certain amount of conditionality, as we would 
                      not regard it as just for our hard labour to be exploited 
                      by people who were not contributing - but we would not want 
                      conditions to be too onerous, otherwise they might impinge 
                      on us. A possibility that Galston doesn't consider is that 
                      someone who holds the 'veil of ignorance' theory of justice 
                      is bound to support a Citizen's Income, for whatever position

                      a more equitable distribution of material resources, and 
                      a greater affirmation of mutual care than currently exists 
                      in either Britain or the United States. A welfare system 
                      grounded in an ethic of mutual responsibility is essential

                      mothers' employment in the labour market affects their children. 
                      If liberal political theory regards labour in the economy

                      as a species. It is now more possible for a single parent 
                      to work, so we expect them to do so. Liberal thought-experiments 
                      don't cohere with the way our ancestors lived, and it is 
                      the necessity of mutual responsibility which still drives 
                      public attitudes to benefits policy. But the world changes, 
                      and Wax concludes that in today's economic conditions an 
                      unconditional benefit could be part of the picture - though

                      communitarian citizenship of mutual responsibility, but 
                      they recognize that different political positions can arrive 
                      at the same practical means of inculcating a sense of obligation 
                      in society - though they question whether a single mother's

                      book does indeed raise some vital issues, and it will give 
                      people on all sides of the Citizen's Income debate much 
                      to think about. However, by restricting the notion of 'welfare 
                      reform' to 'making benefits conditional on seeking and finding 
                      employment' the book has not helped the process of relevant 
                      policy-formation and might in fact have hindered it. A further 
                      symptom of the problem is that 'means-testing' isn't in 
                      the index. It is the means-testing attached to many social 
                      security benefits which locks people into them and makes 
                      it hard for the recipients to seek employment. To remove 
                      means-testing would reduce the marginal deduction rates 
                      which are such a disincentive to being economically active, 
                      and for this book to have discussed that issue would have 
                      made the whole debate much more interesting. Means-testing 
                      is as much a political issue as is a work-condition, and 
                      the two issues are intertwined in practical policy-making. 
                      So to omit all consideration of means-testing is to risk 
                      making the book's argument the purely theoretical construction

                      is now less poverty among children and elderly people, this 
                      is not the case for working age adults without dependent

                      consequences of current policy assumptions and approaches' 
                      (p.3). A variety of model lifetimes are chosen: a single

                      a couple with children on average earnings, and a similar

                      varies over the lifecyle are described, and policy recommendations

                      globally 'inequality fell fairly continuously during the 
                      first three quarters of the twentieth century, but thereafter 
                      either remained relatively constant or increased' (p.53).<br>

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Chapter 
                      4 discusses a number of determinants of the distribution 
                      of wealth, and finds that inequality in the distribution 
                      of incomes accounts for only half of the inequality in the 
                      distribution of wealth. Chapter 5 asks how unequal the distribution 
                      of wealth should be on the basis of a variety of views of 
                      what society should be like; and chapter 6 discusses ways 
                      of changing the distribution of wealth. The author recommends 
                      a progressive inheritance tax (p.100), and chapter 7 discusses 
                      the question as to whether this would cause capital flight 
                      and thus reduce the nation's affluence. Chapter 8 recommends 
                      a step by step approach to reform.<br>
                      Whilst it is true that inequality in the distribution of 
                      income accounts for less than half of the inequality of 
                      wealth, it is only just less than half (p.59), so a greater 
                      incentive to earn income amongst the low paid could over 
                      time increase equality of wealth. Thus measures to reduce 
                      the marginal benefit deduction rates for people on low incomes 
                      could well stand alongside a progressive inheritance tax 
                      as a policy designed to reduce the inequality of wealth. 
                      Similarly, different savings habits affect inequality of 
                      wealth (pp.63f), so to reduce disincentives to save amongst 
                      people on low incomes would also reduce inequality of wealth 
                      (as would reducing incentives to save for the better-off). 
                      Thus whilst policies directly related to wealth (such as 
                      inheritance tax) might be useful, co-ordinated income- and 
                      savings-related policies could also have a significant effect.

                      of Welfare-to-Work policies', by Goretti Horgan (pp.49-64). 
                      This article charts some of the reasons for 32% of children 
                      in Northern Ireland living in households whose only income 
                      derives from benefits: unemployment, low pay, a high cost 
                      of living, low levels of public services, large families, 
                      and higher inequality than in the rest of the UK. The Government 
                      is relying on Welfare-to-Work policies to reduce child poverty, 
                      but in Northern Ireland these often exacerbate the problem 
                      because transitions into and out of paid employment can 
                      cause severe financial difficulties for poor families. The 
                      author suggests that there is a 'clear need for policy to 
                      provide greater protection during periods of transition 
                      between benefits and paid work and vice versa. Given that 
                      parents, including lone parents, are being encouraged to 
                      enter the 'flexible labour market', the benefits system 
                      must also become more flexible and cushion families from 
                      the effect of these transitions' (p.60). <br>

                        there will be parents, especially lone mothers, who want 
                        to look after their children themselves without having 
                        to cope with a paid job. There will also be those who
