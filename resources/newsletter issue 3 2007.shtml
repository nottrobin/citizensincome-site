                      Committee Report, Benefits Simplification, published on 
                      the 26th July. The committee has studied the sources of 
                      complexity (and particularly tax credits and means-testing), 
                      the benefits of simplification, the possibility of introducing 
                      a 'complexity index', the effect of high marginal deduction 
                      rates on incentives to work, the claimant experience, and 
                      the Department for Work and Pensions' Benefit Simplification 
                      Unit. The final chapters of the first volume of the report 
                      discuss possibilities for incremental change towards greater 
                      simplicity and also possibilities for fundamental change.

                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">'There 
                        is a direct correlation between the amount of mean-testing 
                        and the complexity of the system. We recommend that the 
                        Government specifically evaluates the current caseload 
                        of means-testing in the system as part of its simplification 
                        efforts and, where possible, reduces it.' (paragraph 51).</font></li>

                        contributory principle adds an additional layer to the 
                        current system and research suggests it is no longer as 
                        relevant to the benefits system as it once was. We therefore 
                        recommend that the Government reviews whether or not the 
                        contributory principle remains a relevant part of the 
                        modern benefit structure' (paragraph 55). </font></li>

                        attempting to address the combined and overlapping complexities 
                        of the benefits and tax credits systems. This omission 
                        must be urgently addressed' (paragraph 148).</font></li>

                        recommend that the Government undertakes research to investigate 
                        whether there remain some groups of claimants for whom 
                        work does not offer the best route out of poverty, and

                        Deduction Rates in parts of the benefits system on overall

                        is not enough to rely on 'masking' complexity; there is 
                        a need to go further and address the rules of the different 
                        benefits and the structure of the system itself' (paragraph

                        SWAB would provide an income for anyone who is legitimately 
                        resident in the UK and is both willing and able to work 
                        (or is exempted from the latter criterion because of illness, 
                        disability or caring responsibilities &#133;..). It would, 
                        therefore, replace Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance 
                        and the planned Employment and Support Allowance, and 
                        the need for any linking rules for people moving between 
                        them' (p.108).</font></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      SWAB would continue as an in-work benefit, and would be 
                      reclaimed through the tax system at a Government-agreed 
                      Marginal Deduction Rate (MDR) as wages rose until it was 
                      exhausted (the MDR taking into account current rates of 
                      income tax and national insurance contributions). The SWAB 
                      would therefore replace tax credits and all benefits withdrawal 
                      rates and would avoid the need for people moving in and 
                      out of employment to notify changes. People already in work 
                      would be able to claim the SWAB. The system would abolish 
                      means-testing at the point of application. Additions for 
                      carers and people with disabilities would be paid, and a 
                      SWAB claim would automatically trigger Housing and Council

                      offer, particularly in relation to simplicity and to incentives 
                      to increase earnings. All that would be required to complete 
                      the journey towards the greatest possible simplicity and 
                      employment incentives would be to replace the Marginal Deduction

                      would have the same effect as the MDR), to remove the seeking-employment 
                      and incapacity tests (which, in the absence of an MDR, would 
                      become irrelevant), and to enable every individual to claim

                      that 'point-in-time studies underestimate the scale of poverty 
                      in the UK. Over an eight-year period, a third of the population 
                      experience poverty at least once: twice as much as the poverty 
                      rate at any one time'. The 'dynamics research' approach 
                      has highlighted three different types of poverty: transient, 
                      persistent and recurrent. While most people who enter poverty 
                      leave quickly, a minority experience persistent poverty. 
                      The study has also found that poverty in one generation 
                      increases the chances of poverty in the next. The full report,

                      The report concludes: 'strategies to eradicate poverty are 
                      undermined if they &quot;cream off&quot; those experiencing

                      proposal that 'at low wages, there should always be a tangible

                      wage is rewarding, rather than simply looking at gross minimum 
                      wage. Hence, for gross incomes below 40 hours per week at 
                      minimum wage, we should seek to reduce the marginal tax

                      income. Alternatively payments can be adjusted to reflect 
                      current incomes. On the one hand, the degree of volatility 
                      we find suggests that the justice involved in basing tax 
                      credits on past incomes would be rough. On the other, this

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      conference was very well attended by some 140 delegates 
                      (with a waiting list), from a variety of backgrounds including 
                      from academia, the not-for-profit sector, civil service, 
                      professions, and business. The press was represented by 
                      the Financial Times and The Economist. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      project was inspired by the approaching 30th anniversary 
                      of the 1978 Meade Report (IFS, 1978). When the Meade Report 
                      was published, being aware of his endorsement of social 
                      dividend schemes, I was disappointed to find that a full 
                      social dividend scheme was rejected by his committee in 
                      favour of a two tier social dividend or a new Beveridge 
                      Scheme, on the grounds that the necessary income tax rate 
                      to finance a full SD of 40% of annual income would be 55% 
                      (pp. 271-2). Much of the discussion of these alternative 
                      schemes was taken up with presenting various means by which 
                      benefits could be made to respond to different circumstances 
                      (i.e., complicating it).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Working 
                      drafts of the eleven chapters for the Mirrlees Review had 
                      been posted on the IFS website before the conference. They 
                      covered the following subject areas: Taxation in the UK; 
                      Political economy; Tax rates on family earnings; Indirect 
                      taxes; The main household tax base; Wealth taxation; Tax 
                      implementation issues; Company taxation; Taxation of international 
                      capital; Small business taxation; and Environmental taxation. 
                      All of the papers are labelled as 'Draft paper - please 
                      do not quote without the authors' permission', and the website 
                      explains that the factual evidence in them cannot be guaranteed 
                      for accuracy at this stage, and that the authors' views 
                      expressed in them will not necessarily represent their final 
                      ones, since the process is expected to be interactive, and 
                      they welcome comments on the drafts.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      format for most sessions, lasting about 70 minutes, took 
                      the form of a short presentation of the chapter, followed 
                      by one or two commentaries, each lasting about 10 minutes, 
                      to which the authors responded, followed by 30 minutes of 
                      discussion from the floor. This was quite a tight schedule 
                      as so many people wished to comment. Fortunately, time-keeping 
                      during the sessions was well disciplined. The conference 
                      was intense and hard-working. On the last day there were 
                      five overview sessions. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">While 
                      most of the conference was taken up by other aspects of 
                      taxation, there seemed to be a general consensus that income 
                      maintenance was probably the area that needed the most urgent 
                      changes. Delegates thought that the income tax returns were 
                      long enough, but they were horrified at the even greater 
                      amount of information that was required from claimants every 
                      time that they had a change in their lives. There was also 
                      some comment about the large amount of economic theory in 
                      the papers, and a lack of sociology or psychology. This 
                      may reflect the fact that only 5 of the 32 authors of the 
                      eleven chapters were women, and none were sociologists or 
                      psychologists. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">It 
                      was also acknowledged that lobbying by different interest 
                      groups, usually on behalf of privileged groups, led to the 
                      many distortions and anomalies in the tax system.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      chapter about tax rates on family earnings, with the working 
                      title 'Optimal Household Labor (sic) Income Tax and Transfer 
                      Programs', was the one that interested me most, with its 
                      relevance to our own Citizen's Income concerns. This chapter 
                      was one where the comment about a superfluity of economic 
                      theory was relevant. Nearly half of the paper is devoted 
                      to a fairly mathematical exposition and analysis of optimal 
                      tax theory, which tries to arrive at a trade-off between 
                      redistribution and the increased tax rates on income that 
                      result, creating greater disincentives to work. Even if 
                      its results are directly relevant to the design of benefits 
                      and personal income tax, for most of us this could be delegated 
                      to an appendix. One suspects that its inclusion was in deference 
                      to James Mirrlees' chairmanship of the review, such subject-matter 
                      being the main work for which his well deserved Nobel Prize 
                      for Economics in 1996 was awarded.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">To 
                      me, this chapter on family earnings reads like a comedy 
                      review of the 'good news, bad news' type, but without the 
                      comedy. It recognises many of the shortcomings of the Tax 
                      Credit systems currently in place, and recommends replacing 
                      Tax Credits, Income Support, Job Seekers Allowance and possibly 
                      Child Benefit, with a new system to be called Family Allowances. 
                      This would be payable on an individual basis (good news), 
                      but would pay less to the partners of a couple than to a 
                      single adult (bad news), giving &pound;40 pw to each single 
                      adult, &pound;80 pw to lone parents, &pound;66 pw to a childless 
                      couple, &pound;82 pw to a couple with children, and &pound;47.60 
                      pw for each dependent child, paid to the mother. The penalisation 
                      of couples does nothing to reduce the complexity of the 
                      system, nor does it get rid of the distasteful cohabitation 
                      rule. Nor was the problem of defining a non-married couple 
                      addressed. One fairly convincing economic law predicts that 
                      if the price of something is increased, people will choose 
                      less of it. The penalisation of marriage and cohabitation 
                      could contribute to the break up of two parent families, 
                      especially those on low incomes, where family finance is 
                      one of the main causes of divorce and separation.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      recommendations are designed to avoid the very high effective 
                      marginal tax rates which arise from the withdrawal of Means 
                      Tested Benefits and the payment of income tax at the same 
                      time. This is to be brought about by increasing the income 
                      tax thresholds for each group (good news), so that after 
                      a &pound;100 pw earnings disregard, the withdrawal of Family 
                      Allowance at 45% is completed first, before becoming liable 
                      for standard rate income tax. (This is effectively a type 
                      of Negative Income Tax system - good news). The standard 
                      rate will become 25%, by abolishing the current 10% rate 
                      and raising the current 22% rate to 25%. Adding 11% National 
                      Insurance contributions gives an effective rate of 36%. 
                      Then all tax payers become eligible for the higher rate 
                      of income tax of 40% at the same threshold of gross income 
                      as currently (&pound;39,825 pa), making for some complicated 
                      administration (bad news). They were also considering the 
                      introduction of a higher rate of taxation of 46.5% on gross 
                      incomes of about &pound;60,000 pa. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Why 
                      introduce 4 different rates of tax at roughly the same rate 
                      (45%, 36%, 40% and 46.5%)? Why not just have a flat rate 
                      tax of 40% between the &pound;100 pw earnings disregard 
                      and the higher rate tax of 46.5% (or even 50%) on gross 
                      incomes over &pound;60,000 pa? </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">While 
                      the Children's Family Allowance is to be paid to the mother 
                      (good news), it is also withdrawn from the mother at the 
                      45% rate (bad news), compared with Child Benefit, which 
                      can be regarded as the child's income but administered by 
                      the mother. Child Benefit is easily the most effective, 
                      efficient and successful income transfer system that we 
                      have ever had. Why get rid of it? Why not extend it?</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Lastly, 
                      the Family Allowance is for all families with children, 
                      low-income people without children, and unemployed people 
                      (good news), but there will be a work availability requirement 
                      for this latter group (bad news).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">There 
                      was much of interest in this conference. The once-in-a-generation 
                      opportunity to review, and maybe influence the reform of, 
                      the tax system is very exciting. There were some obvious 
                      omissions. For instance, while the increasing inequalities 
                      in income are well known, the greater and increasing inequality 
                      of wealth was acknowledged, but not addressed. There was 
                      a section on the taxation of income from capital (interest 
                      and dividends), Capital Gains Tax, and the taxation of capital 
                      transfers, but nothing on taxation of the holding of wealth. 
                      There were references to a Land Value Tax, but no meaningful 
                      proposal or analysis. </font></p>

                      analyses of distributional effects and surveys of policy 
                      consequences have been mainly concerned with final incomes, 
                      these papers squared up to doubts about whether income is

                      radical departure has been brought about by the findings 
                      of research on well-being, understood either as successive 
                      moments of happiness or misery, or as overall satisfaction 
                      with life. Because the Citizen's Income principle deals 
                      in cash transfers, the lack of any long-term correspondence

                      much a challenge to this as other social security approaches.</font></p>

                      equity? Is the finding that believers and religious activists 
                      enjoy higher levels of SWB grounds for faith-based welfare 
                      agencies? Are citizens of countries with large social assistance 
                      components of their benefits systems less supportive of 
                      poverty relief and if not (as turns out to be the case),

                      participants in this seminar were clearly both puzzled and 
                      invigorated by these questions. They felt licensed to trade 
                      in qualitative examples of anomalies, and to speculate about 
                      quirky statistical patterns. There was a rich diversity 
                      of examples, from East Asia and the Middle East as well 
                      as Europe and North America. The index of children's well-being, 
                      which left the UK at the bottom of the OECD league table, 
                      provoked almost as much controversy here, when presented 
                      by Jonathan Bradshaw, as it had in the media in April. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      opening papers set the terms for the debate. Robert MacCulloch 
                      showed that the advantages, in terms of equality and security, 
                      produced by welfare states were demonstrable, but that the 
                      failure of Subjective Well-being to rise in line with average 
                      incomes demanded explanation. Neither the idea of adaptation 
                      to higher consumption levels, nor that of the existence 
                      of some unexplored missing variables (such as long working 
                      hours, insecurity of employment, stress or pollution) was 
                      entirely convincing. Why does an individual's measurement 
                      of SWB so quickly revert to near its previous level after 
                      rising with a pay increase, yet remain lower for much longer 
                      after sudden redundancy or the loss of a partner, for example?</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Erik 
                      Schokkaert argued that the answers are not to be found in 
                      reversion to Benthamite utilitarianism (recording our happiness 
                      on hedonimeters from moment to moment), but in refining 
                      Amartya Sen's capabilities approach to well-being. The latter 
                      sees human flourishing as made up of a number of 'functionings', 
                      including freedom, health, education, employment and mobility, 
                      but has difficulty in indexing them within a combined measure 
                      of well-being; perhaps overall, reflective satisfaction 
                      with one's life might supply this? But he advocated eliminating 
                      those elements of SWB which involved personal choices, such 
                      as marriage and religious faith, as 'ethically non-relevant' 
                      for distributive equity, despite their strong influence 
                      on measured outcomes. Some participants questioned his justifications 
                      for 'responsibility-sensitive egalitarianism'.</font></p>

                      van Praag, one of the pioneers of happiness research, presented 
                      global data on the ageing of human populations, and the 
                      challenge for social security systems. Although older people 
                      tend to be happier than those in middle age, this trend 
                      undermines social security systems, not only because of 
                      rising costs of pensions, but also because of the risks 
                      of isolation from social sources of well-being in increasingly 
                      mobile and consumption-oriented societies. </font></p>

                      the many other papers, some of which were given in parallel 
                      session, three dealt specifically with CI as a policy proposal. 
                      Tony Fitzpatrick analysed the relationships between streams 
                      of unconditional income which were (paternalistically) released 
                      over time, and one-off or occasional lump sums (grants or 
                      dividends) of the kinds advocated by Ackerman and Le Grand. 
                      He showed that it was possible to present arguments for 
                      combining these two principles in several ways. Hartley 
                      Dean contrasted 'hedonic' and 'eudaemonic' approaches to 
                      social security, and examined the implications of the Aristotelian 
                      version of the good life (civic duty and intellectual fulfilment) 
                      for social security. He considered the Global Left's demands 
                      for a universal basic income in this context. My own paper 
                      looked at whether CI would better enable the exchanges of 
                      social value (care, respect and the sense of belonging) 
                      which are more important components of SWB than purely material 
                      goods, and concluded that it could, if cultural and public 
                      service shifts supported a transformation of this kind.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Linked 
                      with this last point, several of the papers considered the 
                      forms taken by measures for poverty relief and income protection, 
                      from the standpoint of how they distributed social esteem 
                      or stigma. Michael Rassell's research investigated why Russian 
                      war and work veterans, the main beneficiaries under the 
                      Soviet system, came out in mass protest at the conversion 
                      of their in-kind subsidies (travel concessions, rent reductions, 
                      fuel allowances, etc.) into cash benefits. This was mainly 
                      because such subsidies had been given as privileges, associated 
                      with high status and public recognition, whereas cash was 
                      seen as a lowly form of compensation, which was in many 
                      cases less successful in achieving full social inclusion.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Another 
                      example was the form of poverty relief taken in the Lebanon. 
                      Rana Jawad's paper analysed the moral and religious basis 
                      for the support given by religious agencies, mainly to women 
                      and children. The ethos for these systems is similar to 
                      that of such charities as the Charity Organisation Society 
                      in nineteenth century Britain, yet they command high loyalty 
                      and commitment from donors and recipients, and supply some 
                      of the explanation for the support mobilised by Hizbullah.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      challenge for CI advocates is to show how a proposal which 
                      at first sight might seem the logical counterpart to extreme 
                      liberal, individualist economic relations might be made 
                      consistent with more solidaristic and communal social relations, 
                      in which those who used their CI for informal cultural and 
                      political activities are given high esteem. Neither the 
                      paternalism of Soviet privileges, nor the sectarian basis 
                      for Lebanese social support, fit the conditions for a diverse, 
                      secular, multi-ethnic society, but both should cause us 
                      to reflect on the bases for the esteem and inclusion that 
                      are essential aspects of well-being.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      advantage claimed by CI, that its unconditionality allows 
                      greater access to the goods of self-respect and citizenship 
                      than the selective coercions of welfare-to-work can deliver, 
                      are nullified if those who do caring and community work 
                      are not valued for their contributions. This point was reinforced 
                      by the finding in Monika Mischke, Michaela Pfeifer and Claus 
                      Wendt's paper, that in EU countries with large social assistance 
                      sectors (such as Ireland, the UK and some Mediterranean 
                      states), support for a 'guaranteed minimum income' for citizens 
                      was higher than in countries with more comprehensive social 
                      insurance provision. In other words, the argument against 
                      selectivity - that it confers stigma on recipients - may 
                      be offset by various cultural factors, perhaps including 
                      the recognition that brute luck is a major factor in poverty, 
                      especially in conditions of rapid economic transformation.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Among 
                      the other interesting papers was one by Beverley Searle 
                      and Susan Smith, which examined the idea that housing wealth 
                      might act as a substitute for income maintenance safety 
                      nets in a post-Thatcher 'property-owning democracy'. Home 
                      ownership is now widely used as the means of access to a 
                      stream of credit in the UK; the paper related mortgage equity 
                      withdrawal as a substitute for other types of loan (or benefit) 
                      to rates of well-being. Having a housing asset confers a 
                      'feel-good' factor (safety against uncertainty), and can 
                      also smooth income after unemployment or marital breakdown; 
                      it already plays an important role in strategies for household 
                      financial management. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">However, 
                      those whose homes are their only investments are vulnerable 
                      to price variations and must work hard to sustain their 
                      value; they score lower on SWB than those who have a wider 
                      financial portfolio, or those who lack an investment strategy.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">This 
                      finding mirrors many others in research on the human consequences 
                      of economic restructuring in countries such as Australia 
                      and the USA. Housing wealth is sought after and used as 
                      a welfare resource, which offsets the cutbacks in benefits 
                      and public services characteristic of such regimes. But 
                      this illustrates the changing character of the 'welfare' 
                      enjoyed by citizens in Anglophone countries, which stems 
                      from neither solidaristic inclusion nor egalitarian membership, 
                      but from competitive, possessive individualism. This form 
                      of 'welfare' seems to diverge more from well-being than 
                      its predecessor. In many ways, the conference, like the 
                      debates in psychology and economics which led to it, signals 
                      a recognition that a model for public policy which conflates 
                      welfare and well-being within the concept of 'utility' (or 
                      uses money as a proxy) is in danger of pointing us towards 
                      an impoverished quality of life.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Meanwhile, 
                      there are plenty of dilemmas for income maintenance in those 
                      countries, which have been less gung-ho about economic restructuring, 
                      as was demonstrated by several papers from Swedish participants, 
                      and by two from Japan. The latter showed how that state's 
                      policies are adapting to a combination of economic stagnation 
                      and the ageing population, through a long-term care element 
                      in social insurance provision. Having studied the German 
                      and Dutch systems, they have opted for an in-kind version, 
                      with no option for claimants to receive their support in 
                      cash. Given that our UK model is moving towards 'individual 
                      budgets' for the purchase of packages of long-term care, 
                      this is an interesting divergence; but not, it seems, one 
                      that directly addresses well-being.</font></p>

                      Japanese government fears fraudulent claims which have cost 
                      the German system, with its cash option, heavily. Some issues 
                      persist in one form or another through every change in the 
                      organisation of social protection.</font></p>

                      political power of private corporations has grown in the

                      to favour the private interests of corporations (even by 
                      cutting individual rights and liberties, or promoting processes 
                      of re-militarisation in areas of geopolitical interest) 
                      and it is difficult still to claim that globalisation works 
                      at the margins of politics. In the same way that the British 
                      Empire was, during the 17th and 18th centuries, a necessary 
                      condition for British capitalism, the great economic powers 
                      of today use the influence of states to consolidate their

                      scenario has prompted the emergence of certain forms of 
                      resistance. Campaigns of consumer and stakeholder activism 
                      have, in some instances, forced big companies to use concepts 
                      such as social responsibility, business ethics, environmental 
                      policies, community development or corporate governance. 
                      Despite the possible hypocrisy of the means, these campaigns 
                      open a space where citizens can pursue their goals: in exchange 
                      for a good image (and higher sales), corporations are pushed 
                      to adopt measures that protect their products from the ethics 
                      of consumers; and consumers get, in return, a bit of the 
                      terrain stolen from their sovereignty. The will that citizens 
                      once expressed with their votes (regardless of the attention 
                      that such may have received 1) can now also be expressed 
                      at petrol stations, sports departments, and supermarket 
                      tills - at least, to the extent that social structure allows:

                      can a Citizen's Income (CI) contribute to the conditions 
                      that promote a consumer ethics? The question that this paper 
                      poses is threefold. First, can a CI favour a distribution 
                      of paid employment time in such a way that citizens can 
                      obtain a critical distance from the workings of the machinery 
                      in which they take part and obtain a perspective from which 
                      to scrutinise the product being generated? Second, can a 
                      CI equip 'consumer-citizens' with a purchasing power which 
                      enables them to exert a real influence on the behaviour 
                      of corporations? And third: can a CI guarantee to the 'producer-consumer-citizens' 
                      a fallback position that allows them to increase their bargaining 
                      power in the labour market? </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                      seems reasonable to think that, with a CI, individuals could 
                      participate in (and take greater command of) a process in 
                      which, right now, their opinion - their voice 2 - is not 
                      being considered. Can a CI empower citizens by linking their 
                      role as consumers with their role as producers? Can it provide 
                      them with the capability to demand, both as consumers (with 
                      a renewed purchasing power) and as producers (with a greater 
                      resistance power) more democratic contractual and organisational 
                      forms of labour, closer to that which they would really 
                      choose in conditions of full liberty and autonomy? 3 As 
                      Erik Olin Wright has already suggested, 4 a CI could decommodify 
                      labour, strengthen its power in relation to that of capital, 
                      and open a way towards new forms of organisation, freer 
                      and more autonomous, both in production and consumption: 
                      something that could pose a real challenge to the ugliest 
                      aspects of capitalism.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      answering those questions, this paper aims to find the point 
                      of convergence between the strategies of corporate watch 
                      and the proposal for a CI. Exercising citizenship in a world 
                      run by big corporations demands having the ability to decide 
                      in the marketplace - of goods and services, but also of 
                      labour. Our claim is that a CI would promote the expansion 
                      of this new form of political expression and ethical consumption 
                      beyond the middle classes; it would make it as universal 
                      as the vote is now. The effects that, in the long run, would 
                      follow the introduction of a substantial CI (equivalent, 
                      at least, to the poverty line) would surely be radical and 
                      irreversibly linked to the configuration of new relations 
                      of power, both in the consumption and the production spheres: 
                      freer individuals from the demand side (of commodities) 
                      would choose their goods and services with a higher responsibility, 
                      and freer individuals from the supply side (of labour) would 
                      choose how to produce with higher autonomy. But these lines 
                      do not aim that far: having placed the case for the universal 
                      right to vote in the background, the objective of this paper 
                      is simply to highlight the complementary relationship that 
                      exists between a new way of social protest and the support 
                      promised by the introduction of a CI.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">However, 
                      introducing a CI would not necessarily lead to more conscientious 
                      consumers, or to a higher civic pressure on corporations. 
                      First, consumers might use the resources made available 
                      by a CI to fulfil an apolitical consumption: that is, they 
                      might use those resources with no intention whatsoever to 
                      reward or sanction corporations. There is no evidence to 
                      support the assumption that a degree of political commitment 
                      in this particular area would develop. 5 Secondly, in contemporary 
                      capitalism the marketing apparatus of corporations very 
                      often determines the demand for their products and, ultimately, 
                      the functioning of markets. And thirdly, with a CI, strategies 
                      to put pressure on corporations would most probably still 
                      be restricted to consumers of certain sectors of the middle 
                      classes in the developed world. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having 
                      said that, a CI properly integrated with the tax system 
                      would confer a level of economic security that would allow 
                      individuals to scrutinise the production process and choose 
                      alternative ways to consume should they wish to do so. We 
                      can even claim that, with a CI, the decision to maintain 
                      consumption patterns could be seen as a decision taken in 
                      a condition of greater autonomy. In other words, corporate 
                      watch, consumer responsibility and the fight for economic 
                      democracy, like all forms of social and political action, 
                      are 'income-sensitive' forms of social and political action. 
                      Individuals can take part in them if they enjoy the material 
                      security that is necessary to do so, that is, to devote 
                      their spare time (and their energy) to fight for other forms 
                      of production and to foster the ethics of consumption. This 
                      is precisely the reason why those who engage in campaigns 
                      of responsible consumption tend to belong to middle and 
                      upper social classes. Our claim is that a CI would lower 
                      the threshold from which citizens might consider taking 
                      part in those campaigns, and allow them to take decisions 
                      from a more autonomous position, either as consumers or 
                      workers. The economic security that a CI would grant to 
                      individuals would not constitute more - but not less either 
                      - than a condition of possibility. </font></p>

                      Pressure: Strategies of Boycott and the New Consumer Ethics</i></font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      the mid-nineties the oil and gas company Shell became the 
                      target of a boycott launched by consumers against its environmental 
                      practices and its collaboration with the corrupt government 
                      of Nigeria. This episode of consumer belligerency marked 
                      a turning point in the expression of political activism 
                      and showed that citizens are still willing to make use of 
                      their political power, but from a terrain where traditional 
                      politics is not sufficient, namely by using their purchasing 
                      influence to promote changes in the policy of corporations. 
                      These incidents also showed that the loss of popular sovereignty 
                      is being confronted by citizens (or, at least, by those 
                      citizens with their daily subsistence guaranteed) who aspire 
                      to recover it by trying to re-politicise their participation 
                      in the production and consumption spheres.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Together 
                      with selective purchasing, other strategies have also put 
                      pressure on multinationals. A lawsuit by McDonald's caused 
                      an impact on public opinion and revealed how different the 
                      reality of a corporation can be under the cellophane of 
                      their corporate image: deplorable labour conditions, cruelty 
                      to animals, the use of not very healthy raw materials, and 
                      abuses of marketing power were uncovered by the two English 
                      ecologists who, also in the mid-nineties, were taken to 
                      court by the company. 6 Even though such libel lawsuits 
                      are still a guarantee of victory for big corporations (which 
                      find in the law - and in their substantial resources to 
                      make use if it - an efficient instrument to criminalise 
                      the dissidents that make public their voice), the victory 
                      of this strategy was bad publicity: a counterweight to marketing, 
                      and a window that breaks the disinformation so often promoted 
                      by corporations. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally, 
                      a third strategy in the cause of business ethics has been 
                      timidly activated - though with clear signs of its political 
                      potential - from the very heart of corporate power: it is 
                      the pressure that, from their shareholder positions, citizens 
                      and groups can exert through corporations' Annual General 
                      Meetings. Ethical demands have found in investments a way 
                      to influence decision processes. Again, the success of this 
                      strategy does not reside in its power to affect directly 
                      the corporation policies, but in its ability to generate 
                      negative publicity. This is exactly what happened at the 
                      AGM of the petrol group BP, at which a coalition of environmentalists 
                      and ethical investment groups arrived disguised as polar 
                      bears to protest against the activities of the company in 
                      the Arctic Ocean. 7 What this strategy manifests is the 
                      importance of having access to the status of owners, besides 
                      that of consumers, in a world where the most important decisions 
                      are being taken in private forums. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our 
                      question here is: can a CI provide the necessary material 
                      and civil independence to allow individuals to make use 
                      of AGMs, with a real independence of thought? Can a CI favour 
                      an autonomous process in which individuals can form their 
                      preferences with regard to the spheres of production, consumption, 
                      investment and financing? Can a CI act as a catalyst for 
                      these proposals of social innovation - from corporate watch 
                      and responsible consumption to ethical banking or cooperativization? 
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All 
                      in all, the three strategies explored so far (selective 
                      purchasing, lawsuits to force corporations to be transparent 
                      in their activities, and the pressure that citizens can 
                      put on corporations as shareholders and investors) share 
                      a common objective: to hold corporations accountable for 
                      the political implications of their activities and to enable 
                      the market to ameliorate the lack of accountability exercised 
                      by institutional politics. The philosophy that underlies 
                      these initiatives is to establish a consumer ethics to fill 
                      in the gap left by the absence of an economic ethics. In 
                      practice, the aim is to use the only language understood 
                      by corporations (their sales) to encourage respect for human 
                      and labour rights, the protection of the environment, the 
                      promotion of investments founded on ethical principles, 
                      and sanctions against oppressive regimes - so often maintained 
                      by the corporations themselves - by withdrawing investments. 
                      The new consumer ethics seeks to incorporate all these elements 
                      in the equation of costs and benefits that determines the 
                      corporation's priorities, and it does so by re-politicising 
                      all of the areas that globalisation has left exposed and 
                      by making use of the same instrument which drives other 
                      corporate priorities: the market. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
                      we aim to analyse here is to what extent the coordinated 
                      action of consumers could become a real monopsony (monopoly 
                      purchasing power) in which the only buyer could dictate 
                      to the suppliers - be these many, few or just one - the 
                      conditions of production and sale. What we claim in the 
                      next section is that such a possibility is reinforced when 
                      it is accompanied by a CI as this guarantees the material 
                      independence and the freedom necessary for citizens to judge 
                      the productive process in all its dimensions. Before developing 
                      this, though, we will explore some of the impacts of this 
                      consumer strategy.</font></p>

                      some might argue against crossing the frontier that separates 
                      politics from businesses, the reality is that big corporations 
                      have crossed that line on multiple occasions: for example 
                      in Germany, after Schroeder's first government attempted 
                      to increase taxes on corporations. A coalition of these, 
                      including Deutsche Bank, Allianz and BMW, threatened the 
                      government with relocating their plants and investments 
                      in low cost countries. In the words of one of the spokesmen 
                      of the coalition, the matter affected no less than 14,000 
                      workers. The episode ended with the resignation of the Finance 
                      Minister and with a plan to reduce taxes which took them 
                      to lower levels than in the United States. 8 The list of 
                      similar episodes has grown in recent years in all countries 
                      of the (so-called) advanced economy.</font></p>

                      is here that the CI proposal finds common ground with the 
                      movements of responsible consumption. The argument is more 
                      fundamental than programmatic: it is not just that by giving 
                      a CI to every citizen they will have a greater power in 
                      relation to corporations. It is rather that, given the circumstances, 
                      the republican dictum according to which there is no freedom 
                      without material autonomy has become truer than ever.9 </font></p>

                      on those non-elected organisms is acting as both workers 
                      and consumers with a reinforced social position, then the 
                      resources guaranteed by the right to a CI, on which that 
                      action can be based, appears as a condition for the individual's 
                      participation in the production and consumption spheres. 
                      It is only in this way that they can get closer to their

                      10 a CI contributes a guaranteed condition of material and

                      big corporations have started to worry about the social 
                      impact of their activities it is because they have discovered 
                      that it is in their interest to do so: because it is their 
                      names and their sales figures which are at stake, and because 
                      to have workers in good conditions allows them to be more 
                      productive. The more sanctions individuals can impose with 
                      their purchases, the more hostile to the pure economic profit 
                      will become the niche to which corporations will have to 
                      adapt. The question is not whether they have to be ethically 
                      responsible; the question is rather that their customers 
                      - some customers from some places, at least - ask them to 
                      be responsible in order to recover their power. If citizens 
                      see in their purchases, more than in their votes, a means 
                      of political pressure, then a CI appears to be one of the 
                      few ways in which to make real the right which every citizen 
                      has to participate in politics.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But 
                      we can go still further. A CI constitutes a tool able to 
                      generate a real deal between capitalists and consumers-producers, 
                      a deal aiming at the heart of the production and consumption 
                      processes of contemporary societies. This is a true deal 
                      - not a resigned submission - brought about by the twofold 
                      threat that the consumers-workers can pose to the owners 
                      of the means of production: denying their purchase (of certain 
                      products) and denying their production (for certain brands). 
                      The capability to deny consumption and to deny production 
                      could become a power of resistance (and the right to resist) 
                      of those occupying the most vulnerable positions, enabling 
                      them to match the bargaining positions of capitalists. 11

                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                      CI opens the channels to turn what was an ignored voice 
                      into a real exit: exit from certain channels of distribution 
                      and consumption, on the one hand; and exit from certain 
                      units of production, on the other. It is in the interest 
                      of the owners of the means of production to retain the consumers-workers; 
                      and this makes it feasible to think that they would finally 
                      attend this twofold demand: the demand on the labour side 
                      understood as complementary to the demand from the consumption 
                      side. Dismissing the first demand carries the danger of 
                      leaving corporations both without consumers and without 
                      producers. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      this situation, the owners of the means of production would 
                      realise the necessity of taking the rights of individuals 
                      (consumers and producers) seriously. Indeed, it is not a 
                      matter of letting companies that are governed by non-accountable 
                      actors decide, under temporary pressures, that they want 
                      to achieve an agreement with those putting the pressure 
                      on. Nor is it just a matter of creating the possibility 
                      for these companies to put a kind face to their equally 
                      despotic attitude, as a benevolent dictator would. The introduction 
                      of a CI would mean that corporations would be forced to 
                      assume the interests of the consumers-producers. In this 
                      sense, the constitutional guarantee of a CI equals the 'constitutionalisation' 
                      of companies. 12 </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      issue is not to trust that corporations really produce in 
                      ethically desirable conditions, as those who talk about 
                      companies' 'capital of trust' believe; it is rather about 
                      having the certainty, as consumers, that the workers had 
                      the possibility to 'exit' the production process when ethically 
                      unacceptable labour conditions were imposed on them. It 
                      is also about providing these workers, fighting to obtain 
                      fairer labour conditions, the purchasing power to interfere 
                      in the formation of the production processes as potential 
                      consumers capable of rewarding or sanctioning corporations 
                      through their purchases. 13 </font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      possibility exists, then, that the same measure - the CI 
                      - can stimulate the struggle for two objectives that are, 
                      in fact, complementary: to strengthen the bargaining position 
                      of non-owners as workers; and to provide those individuals 
                      with the required signs to transform the 'trust in corporations' 
                      into 'security with respect to their behaviour'. In the 
                      extreme, with a CI, only those goods and services produced 
                      in a process where the owners were able to retain their 
                      workers would reach the market. Both demands - that of the 
                      workers and that of the consumers - stem from the same concern: 
                      to create a social and economic order where production, 
                      exchange, and consumption develop in conditions of freedom.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 
                      has been already mentioned that without material autonomy 
                      the idea of freedom is reduced to an empty motto. At the 
                      same time, it is true that the material autonomy that a 
                      CI would confer is a necessary, yet not sufficient, condition 
                      for the enjoyment of freedom -individual and collective 
                      freedom. In this sense, it must be noted that recognising 
                      the presence of relations of power at the core of social 
                      life (that is, the politicisation of the analysis of social 
                      and economic life) enables the urgent re-articulation of 
                      the political sphere that contemporary societies need, once 
                      the actors that dominated it have lost their hegemony and, 
                      with the introduction of a CI, power is re-distributed in 
                      a more homogeneous fashion. 14 This way, the fight against 
                      the dominium (the eradication of the ties of material dependence 
                      among individuals and thus the constitution of a society 
                      effectively civil); and the fight against the imperium (the 
                      fight in favour of the articulation of political institutions 
                      freed from the greed of big corporations) appear as peaks 
                      to be reached at the same time. And, in this ascent, the 
                      CI has, we believe, a lot to offer.</font></p>

                      would be difficult to better the first three paragraphs 
                      of this report as a description of the dilemma facing policy-makers:</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">'If 
                      you offer someone money on condition that they have a particular 
                      characteristic, you give them an incentive to acquire or 
                      keep that characteristic. That is the fundamental source 
                      of the trade-off between income redistribution and work 
                      incentives that confronts all governments with a dilemma.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">'Concern 
                      for poverty or inequality motivates governments to want 
                      to redistribute income, but providing benefits on the basis 
                      of low income reduces the incentive for people on low incomes 
                      to work themselves out of that position (over and above 
                      additional disadvantages of means-tested benefits such as 
                      stigmatizing recipients, requiring burdensome form-filling 
                      and achieving less than full coverage among the entitled 
                      population). Similarly, cutting taxes on higher incomes 
                      encourages people to work to increase their income, but 
                      leaves behind those who do not do so.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">'Thus 
                      the two main ways for a government to help people with low 
                      incomes - providing them with support directly and encouraging 
                      them to earn more themselves - are in head-on conflict with 
                      each other. How best to deal with this conflict has long 
                      been one of the central questions facing academic economists 
                      and economic policy makers' (p.1)</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      researchers choose not to employ models which predict individuals' 
                      employment market behaviour in relation to tax and benefit 
                      changes, but instead translate 'work incentives' as the 
                      financial reward for working compared with not working and 
                      as the financial reward for working harder compared with 
                      not working harder. They find that, among the demographic 
                      groups studied, lone parents have the weakest work incentives;

                      benefits changes have caused incentives to progress (i.e., 
                      to work harder) to deteriorate ( - the incentive to progress 
                      being indicated by the effective marginal tax rate which, 
                      on average, has increased by 3% since 1999).</font></p>

                      in general a trade-off has operated between increasing work 
                      incentive and reducing poverty, but they find a clearer 
                      picture when they simulate tax and benefit changes. Here 
                      they find that changes which unambiguously strengthen work 
                      incentives take more from the poor than from the rich or

                      in which tax and benefit changes affect financial incentives 
                      to enter the employment market or to progress within it: 
                      and, whilst the authors are careful to outline the additional 
                      research needed on individuals' labour market behaviour, 
                      on personal preferences, and on consensus over social goals, 
                      they are able to draw some useful policy conclusions. For 
                      instance, 'while increasing Working Tax Credit would encourage 
                      the first person in a family to work, it would discourage 
                      them from progressing further &#133;&#133; lowering [benefit 
                      and tax credit] taper rates and increasing in-work support 
                      carry a real risk of moving people above the poverty line 
                      but then leaving vast swathes of them barely above that 
                      level' (p.51). The report rightly suggests that 'if such 
                      outcomes help to meet poverty targets, that is partly a 
                      reflection of the deficiencies of headcount measures of 
                      poverty' (p.51).</font></p>

                      favours an increase in Child Benefit (pp.29-30) as this 
                      would reduce poverty in a government target group (families 
                      with children) and would not damage work incentives because 
                      Child Benefit is not withdrawn as earned income rises. A 
                      particular advantage of increasing Child Benefit is that 
                      'benefits accrue disproportionately to the poor' (p.30).</font></p>

                      they at least give us some idea how tax and benefit changes 
                      might alter actual behaviour and therefore give us a better 
                      estimate of work incentives than simply assuming that financial

                      and its suggestion that people without children ought not 
                      to have their work incentives weakened (p.50), it really 
                      is important to follow this report with a study of the effects 
                      which a Citizen's Income would have both on work incentives

                      1974, 7% of adults in Britain between the ages of 20 and 
                      59 were dependent on transfers, mostly social security benefits, 
                      from outside their immediate family. That is, they themselves 
                      were not in employment; and they did not have an employed 
                      partner either. The proportion had soared to 19% by 1993 
                      - nearly one-fifth of the whole age group. In 2003, even 
                      after a 10-year period of economic growth and falling unemployment, 
                      the rate was still 14% - double the figure from the early 
                      1970s' (p.1).</font></p>

                      facts set the agenda for the research project which has 
                      resulted in this important report. The project set out to 
                      describe and to explain the changing distribution of jobs 
                      among families. Some generally useful data on employment 
                      probabilities is clearly presented at the beginning of the 
                      report, and conclusions are drawn in relation to employment 
                      trends for individuals. The analysis then moves on to families 
                      and employment in order to understand the substantial increase 
                      in the proportion of people in non-working families. Graphs 
                      at the foot of p.35 are particularly clear representations 
                      of the upward trends in no-earner and two-earner families.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      incentive structures of the tax and benefits system are 
                      often blamed for the decline in the number of one-earner 
                      families, but Berthoud believes that a sociological explanation 
                      might be more important:</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">'All 
                      the signs are that the social division of employment is 
                      a dominant factor, overriding any economic calculus. There 
                      remains a strong normative expectation against female breadwinners. 
                      Once the existence of such a taboo is hypothesised, many 
                      of the conundrums surrounding no-earner families fall into 
                      place. The number of non-working husbands has increased. 
                      Women are all but forbidden to work if their husbands have 
                      not got jobs, so the wives in these families cannot share 
                      in the general increase in employment experienced by women 
                      in other domestic situations. This means that the number 
                      of no-earner couples must increase. Such a process could 
                      entirely explain the apparent growth in within-family polarisation 
                      &#133;.' (p.51).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">If 
                      this is the case (and the report itself doesn't offer evidence 
                      for this explanation: an additional qualitative research 
                      project would be required), then there is surely a strong 
                      argument for providing incentives for higher employment 
                      rates amongst individuals in no-earner families or for part-time 
                      employment for both men and women. Labour market rigidities 
                      create a clear divide between the full-time male earner 
                      and the male non-earner: surely one of the roots of the 
                      two-earner / no-earner divide. If this is one of the roots 
                      of the problem then that is where the pursuit of a solution 
                      must surely begin. </font></p>

                      an introductory chapter, chapter 2 recognises that we now 
                      expect change in welfare regimes, and that public debate 
                      about the justice and appropriateness of welfare structures 
                      is an increasingly important factor in their design ( - 
                      though given the lack of public debate about tax credits 
                      before they were introduced in the UK, a somewhat more nuanced 
                      conclusion might have been appropriate). Chapter 3 studies 
                      national surveys of values and norms in relation to different 
                      countries' welfare regimes, and finds a correlation between 
                      welfare regime and attitudes towards salary differentials 
                      between skilled and unskilled workers (a factor chosen because 
                      it is likely to tell us how people feel about redistribution 
                      of income). Chapter 4 suggests that 'the degree to which 
                      the poor and unemployed fulfil a number of so-called 'deservingness' 
                      criteria could be the missing link between welfare regimes 
                      and the cross-national differences in attitudes [towards 
                      them]' (p.45). The regime which Larsen knows best is the 
                      Scandinavian one, in which a raft of universal healthcare, 
                      educational and pension benefits means that there's little 
                      sense of there being different groups with different deservingness 
                      levels in society - as opposed to the liberal American system 
                      of fractured provision in which 'the poor and unemployed 
                      &#133;.. will be asked to fulfil much harder deservingness 
                      criteria' (p.55).</font></p>

                      attitudes), and stigmatisation of groups selected for social

                      of tax credits in-year when claimants' incomes increase, 
                      was a recipe for disaster for people on relatively low incomes 
                      who tend to spend their money and have trouble meeting demands 
                      for repayments out of the blue. It was never going to be 
                      helped by a useless computer system' (pp.7f). </font></p>

                      Phelps, the newly created Nobel laureate in economics is 
                      clearly not a friend! As he explained (in the Boston Review 
                      in 2000) why he didn't like UBI: </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;Philippe 
                      Van Parijs makes the strongest imaginable case for universal 
                      basic income. But I remain opposed. For me, there are two 
                      sticking points. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">1. 
                      The demogrant (Phelps's somewhat obscurantist name for UBI) 
                      device has no monopoly on the beneficial effects that make 
                      us like it, whatever the balance of its total benefits and 
                      total cost. The alternative to it - a subsidy to employers 
                      for every low-wage worker in their full-time employ - would 
                      have some of those effects and some other benefits as well. 
                      The subsidy, in pulling up paychecks and the number employed 
                      at the low-wage end of the labor market, would mitigate 
                      serious disadvantages of talent and background; it would 
                      expand the jobs that low earners could afford to reject; 
                      and it would widen low earners' latitude in meeting their 
                      needs.<br>
                      <br>
                      2. The other sticking point is that the demogrant idea seems 
                      in an important respect to go against the grain of the traditional 
                      American conception of a liberal republic. This conception, 
                      I will argue, would cause many Americans to hesitate to 
                      embrace a universal basic income while being willing, at 
                      least in principle, to contemplate low-wage employment subsidies.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      So that is the nub of Phelps's argument: The US public would 
                      never accept a 'money-for-nothing scroungers' charter'. 
                      And anyway, Phelps believes that subsidizing wages would 
                      work better than UBI. He had previously expounded his belief 
                      in wage-subsidy in an influential book Rewarding Work: How 
                      to Restore Participation to Free Enterprise. There is somebody 
                      else who believes in wage-subsidies, and has had the power 
                      to do something about it - Gordon Brown. His WFTC - working 
                      families tax credit scheme - has been developed over his 
                      ten-year tenure at the Treasury. (It has now transmogrified 
                      into CTC and WTC)</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                      consequences of WFTC have been spelled out in many previous 
                      issues of the CI Newsletter: the huge cost, the complex 
                      rules, the widespread blunders with over- and under-payments, 
                      the collusion between employers and workers to milk the 
                      system. Perhaps worst of all is the minefield of tax traps 
                      created for a large slice of the population who find increased 
                      wages lead to sharp withdrawals of WFTC or whatever it is 
                      now called.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Phelps's 
                      view on labour market economics are summarised in a celebratory 
                      article in the Economist (Oct12, 2006): Having demolished 
                      the old Phillips curve mechanism, which says that there 
                      is a trade-off between inflation and unemployment, Phelps 
                      established that there is a 'natural rate' of unemployment 
                      for the economy. Sadly, this rate is below full employment, 
                      and unemployment - a manifest market failure to clear - 
                      will persist. A continuing level of unemployment is actually 
                      a good thing, according to Phelps, because unemployment 
                      produces cowed workers who are diligent and loyal. (No wonder 
                      Economics is known as the dismal science!)</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Comment: 
                      At the heart of Phelps' adherence to the virtues of wage-subsidisation 
                      is the widely held belief of jobs-as-welfare: that a job 
                      (paid employment) is the only way citizens can validate 
                      themselves and earn honest money. Perhaps the majority of 
                      the population agree with Phelps, but it is high time that 
                      they were told: even now (2006) at the height of the subsidised 
                      jobs boom, and with enormous public make-work programmes, 
                      there are still five million UK citizens jobless in one 
                      form or another (see references). The long-hours low-productivity 
                      jobs culture is not doing much to improve the general well-being 
                      of the population either, as the economists such as Layard 
                      studying 'happiness' have discovered . As a palliative to 
                      raise the spirits of the population job-subsidisation is 
                      a flop.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Phelps's 
                      second point, that the public won't accept a 'scroungers' 
                      charter' is valid, so long as most of the mainstream UBI 
                      advocates stick with the idea of income tax as the source 
                      of revenue to pay for it. If you believe in UBI as something 
                      which liberates us all from the tyranny of the job-system, 
                      then income tax is also obsolete. There are many other ways 
                      to raise the money, best of all resource-based taxation. 
                      Like the Alaska dividend, it collects the revenue (economic 
                      rent in economic jargon) that belongs to us all, and then 
                      distributes it equally to all the residents. UBI then becomes 
                      an entitlement income. </font></p>
