                      journal Renewal's aim when it was first published in 1993 
                      was to modernise the Labour Party, and since then it has 
                      developed a broad dialogue on the progressive left. It now 
                      calls itself 'a journal of social democracy', and its explicit 
                      aim is to 'expand the scope of equality, democratic governance 
                      and social freedoms within regulated markets'. 1 <br>

                      decades there have been conservatives, liberals, socialists, 
                      Greens, and various others, both individually and through 
                      their think-tanks and policy groups, actively discussing 
                      a Citizen's Income as a means of renewing the tax and benefits 
                      system. What might best be called the 'progressive left' 
                      has been rather silent on the matter. Three years ago the 
                      organisation Compass ('direction for the democratic left') 
                      published a thinkpiece on a Citizen's Income, which was 
                      welcome; but when it published its manifesto, The Good Society, 
                      the chapter on a Citizen's Income was removed just before 
                      publication. The reason given was hesitancy about the idea's 
                      acceptability to the manifesto's readership. <br>

                      recent edition of Renewal looks set to change this reticence. 
                      It discusses the notion of 'the commons': 'A commons arises 
                      whenever a given community decides that it wishes to manage 
                      a resource in a collective manner, with a special regard 
                      for equitable access, use and sustainability. It is a social 
                      form that has long lived in the shadows of our market culture, 
                      but which is now on the rise'. 2 The editorial notes that 
                      the edition's authors frequently mention a Citizen's Income 
                      (often termed here a Basic Income) as a means of distributing 
                      the value of the commons to the population as a whole, and 
                      also correctly notes the beneficial effect which a Citizen's 
                      Income would have on volunteering, community activity, and 
                      collective creativity. 3 An editorial is not the place to 
                      discuss in detail all of the references to a Citizen's Income 
                      in the journal's articles, but one particular reference 
                      might be forgiven. In relation to the funding of a Citizen's 
                      Income, Martin O'Neill approves of James Meade's suggestion 
                      that social justice would be well served by extending inheritance 
                      tax to lifetime gifts and using the proceeds to fund a 'social 
                      inheritance'. 4 <br>

                      is a pleasure to see such significant engagement with the 
                      Citizen's Income debate on the progressive left, and we 
                      look forward to seeing a lot more of it.<br>

                      February edition of <b>Benefits</b> contains an article 
                      by Kate Stanley entitled 'Citizen-centred welfare: a single 
                      income replacement benefit and personalized conditions and 
                      support' (<i>Benefits</i>, vol. 16, no. 1, 2008, pp.81-8) 
                      which concurs with the Institute for Public Policy Research's 
                      view that a single working age income replacement benefit 
                      would considerably simplify the benefits system. In more 
                      general terms, the article suggests that within a 'reworking 
                      of rights and responsibilities, proposals to reform welfare 
                      could usefully be measured against at least three criteria: 
                      fairness, simplicity and empowerment. The welfare system 
                      should be fair, both in the way in which its processes treat 
                      people and in the distributional outcomes it produces. The 
                      system should also be seen to be fair, in order to achieve 
                      and sustain broad public support. This should be based on 
                      fair reciprocity, which balances the rights and responsibilities 
                      of citizens, state and civil society. The welfare system 
                      should also be designed and delivered as simply as possible, 
                      promoting efficient administration and helping citizens 
                      to understand their entitlements. Complexity can only be 
                      justified where it respects the diversity of citizens, not 
                      where it simply reflects the interests of the system or 
                      historical anomaly. Finally, the welfare system should be 
                      designed and delivered in ways that maximise the control 
                      and agency of citizens. &#133;..' (p.82). </font></p>

                      from three charities suggests that the Government must take 
                      a holistic, joined-up approach to the tax and benefits systems 
                      if they wish to achieve their objectives of full employment 
                      and an end to child poverty. Researchers working for <b>Community 
                      Links, the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group and Child Poverty 
                      Action Group</b> studied the technical implications for 
                      tax, tax credits and benefits of a set of hypothetical case 
                      studies and then tested the results by interviewing local 
                      people in east London to find out how these interactions 
                      affect their lives. They concluded that moving into work, 
                      or increasing working hours, could lead to unpredictable 
                      outcomes because of the ways in which different individual 
                      circumstances, responses and experiences intersect with 
                      complex fiscal measures. At present, work does not always 
                      pay better than remaining on benefits. While many interactions 
                      between different benefits and tax credits have positive 
                      or coherent policy effects, a substantial number are contradictory, 
                      with (say) the granting of one benefit leading to the withdrawal, 
                      or curtailment, of another. Such interactions can make claimants 
                      worse off by entering work, or working longer hours. The 
                      advent of tax credits, in particular, has changed what was 
                      previously a relatively reliable, fixed system of benefits 
                      into one that is constantly changing with alterations in 
                      claimants' circumstances. This has led to an increase in 
                      complexity, so the interviewees to whom the researchers 
                      spoke to often had little understanding of the systems or 
                      their entitlements. Some spoke of unpleasant surprises, 
                      such as the loss of passported benefits and tax credits 
                      overpayment recoveries. Individuals often felt that remaining 
                      on benefits was the better option financially, though this 
                      did not always mean that they chose not to work.<br>

                      of the financial support they are entitled to. The system 
                      is fragmented and too often one policy contradicts another 
                      in its effect on low-income families. All parts of the system 
                      need to work together to maximise family incomes and help 
                      end child poverty for good.'<br>

                      in kind such as free school meals can be crucial in dissuading 
                      them from taking up work. True work incentives cannot be 
                      achieved by single policies; there has to be a clear, coherent 
                      and holistic strategy across the entire tax/benefit system, 
                      and across all government departments.'<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      decade ago, the Oxford economist Tony Atkinson voiced a 
                      concern, shared by most basic income proponents, that Citizen's 
                      Income schemes might face insurmountable political obstacles. 
                      Even where good ethical and economic reasons to favour unconditional 
                      grants over means-tested, selective income support exist, 
                      'it will be difficult to secure political support for a 
                      Citizen's Income while it remains unconditional on labour 
                      market or other activity' (1). As a solution Atkinson proposed 
                      to institute a <i>participation</i> income (PI), a social 
                      assistance program that gives up on means-testing but retains 
                      the politically salient notion of social participation. 
                      Elaborating on his proposal, Atkinson explains:<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <blockquote> 
                      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the 
                        qualifying conditions would include people working as 
                        an employee or self-employed, absent from work on grounds 
                        on sickness and injury, unable to work on grounds of disability 
                        and unemployed but available for work, it would also include 
                        people engaging in approved forms of education or training, 
                        caring for young, elderly or disabled dependents or undertaking 
                        approved forms of voluntary work, etc. The condition involves 
                        neither <i>payment</i> nor <i>work</i>; it is a wider 
                        definition of social contribution. (2)</font></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
                      should come as no surprise that PI has been well received 
                      across the basic income community. Many think it represents 
                      an acceptable <i>ethical compromise</i> between the values 
                      of universal inclusion and social reciprocity, and is thus 
                      capable of appeasing those critics who believe Citizen's 
                      Income will lead to free-riding on a worrying scale. Others 
                      instead believe it offers a necessary <i>political compromise</i>, 
                      allowing various factions within the welfare debate to converge 
                      on a scheme that appears acceptable to all.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Within 
                      the latter group, some have suggested that a PI would inevitably 
                      transform itself into a full-fledged Citizen's Income once 
                      the benefits of further relaxing eligibility conditions 
                      becomes apparent. (3) But meanwhile they are happy enough 
                      to move ahead with a scheme that is considered a close cousin 
                      to Citizen's Income because of its wide (if not quite universal) 
                      coverage, its lack of intrusive bureaucratic control, and 
                      its recognition of the many ways in which citizens genuinely 
                      participate in social life. In short, PI seems uniquely 
                      placed to bridge the otherwise competing perspectives of 
                      unconditional basic income advocates and proponents of 'soft 
                      workfare' And so PI emerges as the strongest candidate of 
                      a Citizen's Income-style proposal that might actually make 
                      it into policy.<br>

                      despite the attraction of and support for PI, precious little 
                      detailed analysis of the proposal has been carried out. 
                      This is unfortunate because there are important questions 
                      to be answered when thinking about the design and implementation 
                      of PI:<br>

                      have important implications for how we design and implement 
                      PI. And perhaps more importantly, by implication, they are 
                      likely to have a major impact on the well-being and autonomy 
                      of its recipients. Thinking seriously about the implementation 
                      of PI, however, reveals a set of problems that are masked 
                      by the overly superficial discussion of PI or 'social participation' 
                      more generally. Our research suggests that these problems 
                      effectively make PI <i>administratively unstable</i>, which 
                      in turn leads to <i>political instability</i>. And if we 
                      are right, then Citizen's Income advocates may have to seriously 
                      rethink whether PI is such a great idea after all.<br>

                      This in fact means that we need to think how we translate

                      participation, into a set of <i>suitably precise standards 
                      or rules</i>. One important goal is to ensure that all relevant 
                      individuals - administrators and claimants alike - can reliably 
                      determine whether a particular person is eligible or not.

                      these criteria to PI immediately demonstrates the problem 
                      facing administrators. PI is based on a very broad (and 
                      relatively vague) notion of social participation. This fails 
                      as a precise operational standard simply because it leaves 
                      too much room for interpretation, with different parties 
                      likely to come up with different views on what 'counts' 
                      as relevant social participation. One alternative is to 
                      come up with a set of rules that describe a fixed set of 
                      very clearly specified, 'approved' activities, such as volunteering 
                      at least 10 hours per week, having enrolled in a vocational 
                      course, having at least one dependent to care for, and so 
                      on. But any workable list that we come up with is likely 
                      to be much more restricted than what PI proponents have 
                      in mind when they refer to social participation in a wider 
                      sense. Quite a different solution would be to go for a list 
                      that is so expansive, perhaps even open-ended, as to encompass 
                      any socially worthwhile activity one could think of; but 
                      such expansive lists are very hard to work with in practice, 
                      leading again to interpretation problems and various types 
                      of error. In short, translating the requirement of 'social 
                      participation' into a workable set of standards is not as 
                      straightforward as its advocates assume; it involves having 
                      to make hard practical choices with serious implications 
                      in terms of the expected outcomes of the scheme.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      real problem for PI, however, is not that setting precise 
                      standards is difficult (although it is), but that it seems 
                      much easier to do so for Citizen's Income as well as workfare 
                      policies. Because a Citizen's Income entails no conditions 
                      apart from residency, the problem of having to set a standard 
                      of eligibility literally does not arise, an argument that 
                      is much rehearsed by basic income advocates. What about 
                      workfare? Well, here the reasoning works the other way around: 
                      because workfare is a much more restrictive policy, it too 
                      faces fewer difficulties setting standards that are at the 
                      same time transparent, accessible and congruent to its underlying 
                      policy objectives. A workfare advocate who believes only 
                      labour market participation or human capital improving activities 
                      such as job training or education are socially valuable 
                      will restrict the standards to people who are either in 
                      formal employment or enrolled in approved training courses. 
                      From the point of view of setting standards this is a straightforward 
                      enough way to proceed, no matter what we might think about 
                      the justice of such restrictions.<br>

                      on who receives the grant, while at the same time wanting 
                      to expand these restrictions well beyond what is being used 
                      by current welfare programmes. This position is a difficult 
                      one to maintain as we have demonstrated above, particularly 
                      when we compare PI's performance to the alternatives of

                      in the fields of policy analysis and public administration. 
                      Any scheme that puts conditions in place for restricting 
                      receipt of grants or services to part of the population 
                      must inevitably engage in a process of identifying eligible 
                      recipients, distinguishing them from those who (for whatever 
                      reasons) are not deemed eligible. From a public administration 
                      perspective, this implies producing and maintaining lists 
                      of individuals who satisfy the relevant criteria as well 
                      as setting up a system to monitor whether they continue 
                      to fulfill these criteria.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      main issue is one of informational demands associated with 
                      different policy schemes. Some proposals require much more 
                      information to operate in accordance with the stated or 
                      implied goals, and information is both difficult and expensive 
                      to obtain. In addition, high informational demands tend 
                      to produce opportunistic and strategic behaviour because 
                      individuals can employ a variety of 'loopholes' in the rules 
                      (creative compliance) as well as a variety of errors arising 
                      from both claimants and administrators failing to produce 
                      or appropriately assess key information. (6) In short, the 
                      more information that is required to get a scheme working, 
                      the more difficult is it to implement that scheme in practice.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given 
                      these difficulties, what sort of scheme would be easiest 
                      to administer given the information-gathering demands it 
                      imposes? First, following on from our discussion of standard-setting, 
                      an operational scheme must be straightforward in terms of 
                      determining what the rules of eligibility require in individual 
                      cases (what claimants must do, or not do, to become eligible), 
                      as well as concretely establishing whether they have in 
                      fact complied with these rules. (7) Second, it is preferable 
                      that the sources of information against which such checking 
                      is done already exist, to avoid having to set up complicated 
                      and costly databases from scratch. Moreover, it would be 
                      crucial that the information base itself only infrequently 
                      changes and is not susceptible to manipulation, to ensure 
                      reliability and stability of the assessment process. Where 
                      these conditions are not met, it may be very difficult in 
                      practice to determine reliably whether eligibility criteria 
                      are met. And it may be easy to cheat, either by straightforwardly 
                      misreporting the relevant information or by more subtle 
                      techniques of 'creative compliance', for example where claimants 
                      register for a university course to claim their PI but have 
                      no intention of actually studying for a degree. (8) Much 
                      of this is already familiar from the welfare administration 
                      literature.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let 
                      us now again evaluate PI against these standards and compare 
                      its performance against that of Citizen's Income and workfare, 
                      respectively. It is easy to see how, in this particular 
                      context, the broad notion of social participation again 
                      leads to the public administrator's nightmare scenario. 
                      To begin with, unlike traditional welfare programs PI administrators 
                      cannot rely on comparatively reliable sources of information 
                      such as payroll information or university enrolment, because 
                      that only captures part of the activities that we deem appropriate. 
                      And since there are no comparative reliable sources of information 
                      for care work or volunteering, it seems PI must employ the 
                      sort of intrusive and costly bureaucratic measures (such 
                      as regular visits from case workers) that most advocates 
                      abhor and hope to avoid. A further problem arises when we 
                      reflect on how arbitrariness and local/regional inequalities 
                      may arise because of different interpretations of what constitutes 
                      approved socially valuable activities or the inconsistent 
                      application of imprecise standards, as outlined in the previous 
                      section. (9) If PI is serious about restricting receipt 
                      of the grant to some extent - as it must, if it is to be 
                      a genuine ethical or political compromise - it must also 
                      be serious about combating creative compliance or else face 
                      diminished political and public support. Such is the logic 
                      of welfare policy.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">PI's 
                      weakness in terms of the monitoring of conditions of eligibility 
                      is again best illustrated by a simple comparison with both 
                      Citizen's Income and workfare. Unsurprisingly, an unconditional 
                      Citizen's Income fares much better because of the absence 
                      of eligibility criteria and, by implication, the absence 
                      of the need to identify and monitor (and, where required, 
                      sanction) recipients. It is worth noting that there may 
                      still be good reasons why some type of monitoring would 
                      be a good idea - to ensure that each individual effectively 
                      receives their grant, for instance (10) - but clearly there 
                      is no need to extensively monitor individuals for reasons 
                      of determining who is eligible to receive the grant. Workfare 
                      programs again perform better than PI, but for very different 
                      reasons. Because workfare determines eligibility on very 
                      restrictive grounds - being employed, actively seeking work, 
                      being registered for approved training, etc - it can piggy-back 
                      on a number of 'cadasters' (11) that are present in most 
                      mature welfare states. It is true that monitoring remains 
                      a costly and problematic affair for workfare programmes, 
                      but both the range of activities (and therefore the number 
                      of institutions within which such activities take place) 
                      and the sheer volume of potential recipients (which is much 
                      lower than with either PI or Citizen's Income) makes monitoring 
                      nevertheless more manageable than in the case of PI. So 
                      we conclude that, in this particular field, PI again performs 
                      relatively poorly when compared to Citizen's Income and 
                      workfare.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      final administrative task that a PI must perform is to disburse 
                      the payments to eligible recipients. This is a task that 
                      is never discussed in the literature on Citizen's Income 
                      or PI, but nevertheless raises a number of concerns of note. 
                      What is required is a distribution mechanism, or 'conduit', 
                      which ensures that PI is disbursed <i>effectively</i> to<i> 
                      all</i> eligible recipients (and only those). Effective 
                      conduits require low or no barriers or hurdles facing recipients 
                      but in addition also promote straightforward oversight allowing 
                      administrators to check whether grants have effectively 
                      been received. The latter requirement means that a disbursement 
                      system which can be integrated into a wider administrative 
                      network that cross-checks receipt of funds is superior. 
                      Payment systems with multiple in-built redundancies - overlapping 
                      at various junctures in the claiming process - are one way 
                      to design grant delivery, though it comes at the (budgetary 
                      and organisational) cost of significantly complicating oversight. 
                      An alternative is to simplify payments radically by offering 
                      a single disbursement channel for all recipients: in addition 
                      to the lack of sufficient 'layers' of redundancy, problems 
                      may arise where such channels do not have a truly universal 
                      reach. For instance, homeless people often have no reliable 
                      access to a bank account which poses a problem with centralized 
                      systems that typically make use of bank payments in one 
                      way or another. One important lesson here is to be careful 
                      about so-called technological fixes where we think a mere 
                      'upgrade' of the technology will resolve all administrative 
                      problems.<br>
                      When it comes to delivery mechanisms, Citizen's Income proposals 
                      typically opt for single payment channels: grants are disbursed 
                      either through the tax/credit system or, as in some proposals, 
                      through a designated debit card. This method scores highly 
                      in terms of absence of barriers, but poorly in terms of 
                      oversight and back-up systems (redundancy). Workfare schemes 
                      typically offer systems that are integrated into the administrative 
                      processes that determine eligibility; extensive interventions 
                      by case workers, no matter how much of a nuisance and intrusion 
                      we think they are, have the distinctive advantage of offering 
                      high oversight on payments and creating a valuable frontline 
                      opportunity for claimants to address any issues regarding 
                      non-payment. But this advantage of face-to-face oversight 
                      obviously comes at the cost of significant complexity.<br>

                      Citizen's Income and workfare take opposite, but arguably 
                      equally plausible, routes for addressing problems associated 
                      with delivery systems, PI seems to share none of the strengths 
                      and all of the weaknesses with either scheme. PI cannot 
                      dispense with oversight altogether because it is not truly 
                      universal; and for that reason it cannot rely on the simplest 
                      delivery schemes. And because PI is by definition meant 
                      to be much more comprehensive and expansive than workfare, 
                      frontline oversight would be prohibitively costly and not 
                      a practical option. PI's failures in terms of delivery systems 
                      may not be decisive (we regard them as certainly less troublesome 
                      than the ones discussed before), nevertheless it is clear 
                      PI will face important difficulties and some of the solutions 
                      discussed in the literature may not be available in practice.<br>

                      we now find ourselves in a situation where PI may be intuitively 
                      attractive, yet faces considerable difficulties at the level 
                      of implementation. Needless to say, we don't think it would 
                      be wise for anyone to endorse a scheme that is manifestly 
                      unworkable. So what lessons can be learned in terms of building 
                      a political coalition around PI? Should Citizen's Income 
                      advocates maintain their support for PI in spite of these 
                      practical concerns, or instead refocus on making Citizens'

                        </font></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
                      the first strategy remains faithful to the goals of marrying 
                      universal inclusion and weak reciprocity, it comes at a 
                      high price. First, there are the budget and organisational 
                      costs associated with extensive bureaucracies, which in 
                      an era of budgetary conservatism and general welfare retrenchment 
                      for fiscal reasons seems to raise unsurmountable difficulties. 
                      But in addition to those there are also the costs associated 
                      with intrusion and error, borne by PI recipients and even 
                      the larger population. When these costs increase, it is 
                      fair to say support for the proposed scheme is likely to 
                      plummet and therefore we do not regard it as a promising 
                      or stable strategy.<br>
                      Rejecting the first alternative leaves us with two competing 
                      options: we can turn PI into a workfare or into a Citizen's 
                      Income scheme, respectively. On the workfare alternative 
                      we emphasise those interpretations of social participation 
                      that are easy to specify, easy to monitor, happen to point 
                      at populations easily identified, and so on. Inevitably, 
                      this approach reinforces the primacy of existing practices 
                      and institutions by redrawing PI along lines that already 
                      feature prominently in current welfare programs. Such a 
                      solution is likely to be vehemently opposed by those within 
                      the Citizen's Income movement who endorse PI precisely because 
                      it counters the current restrictive notions of productive 
                      activity as being tied to education and the labour market. 
                      And such opposition in turn will mark the political death 
                      of the PI proposal.<br>

                      then brings us to the third strategy, often floated by Citizen's 
                      Income supporters, where we allow PI to 'erode' gradually 
                      into a full, unconditional basic income. All this really 
                      requires is for administrators to take a very broad attitude 
                      when interpreting what counts as social participation and 
                      a correspondingly lax attitude when it comes to enforcing 
                      such requirements. </font></p>

                      way very few individuals would find themselves de facto 
                      excluded from the scheme, and in a next phase policy-makers 
                      can then further 'harmonize' (read: universalize) the scheme 
                      by putting a genuine Citizen's Income in place. The main 
                      problem with this proposal is that it invokes precisely 
                      the opposition of those PI advocates who, for ethical or 
                      political reasons, take reciprocity and free-riding seriously. 
                      Their opposition is likely to be as vehement to this strategy 
                      as the rejection of workfare-by-stealth by the Citizen's 
                      Income camp. Furthermore, there is no reason to suspect, 
                      as some Citizen's Income advocates rather naively assume, 
                      that soft workfare supporters of PI will not pick up on 
                      any attempt to introduce (by stealth) a Citizen's Income 
                      through the PI path. For all these reasons, we are still 
                      awaiting a convincing argument suggesting that PI will <i>necessarily</i> 
                      evolve into a Citizen's Income and not into a version of 
                      a workfare scheme, which we think is equally (if not more) 
                      plausible.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, 
                      our analysis suggests that the current enthusiasm for participation 
                      income as a political and ethical compromise capable of 
                      attracting a broad coalition of support is probably illusory. 
                      The illusion persists only because of the lack of detailed 
                      analysis of PI so far, and we argue that we must consider 
                      the practical impact of the scheme's design in earnest before 
                      rushing to embrace a policy like PI, no matter how intuitively 
                      appealing for Citizen's Income advocates.<br>
                      Next, our analysis offers important insights in the debate 
                      about the political feasibility of PI and related schemes. 
                      We firmly believe that any political compromise around such 
                      a scheme must be credible in the sense that it must be capable 
                      of reassuring different factions, each firmly holding on 
                      to a distinctive set of ethical and political priorities, 
                      and that the compromise won't come unstuck, favouring one 
                      side or another, in the process of implementation. It is 
                      because of PI's failure on this count that we claim that 
                      <i>administrative instability</i> is likely to lead to <i>political 
                      instability</i>.<br>

                      at the most general level, we hope that we have demonstrated 
                      the importance of taking administrative analysis much more 
                      seriously when considering PI, Citizen's Income and related 
                      policies. Much of our work arises from a discontent with 
                      how Citizen's Income advocates fail to appreciate what the 
                      field of public administration can bring to the debate. 
                      Contrary to the so-called 'transmission-belt' model of administrative 
                      analysis, where implementation only appears on the scene 
                      after ethical, political and economic questions have been 
                      resolved, we firmly believe that a public administration 
                      perspective offers key insights into how various Citizen's 
                      Income policies should be designed and implemented. If we 
                      want to move the debate from ideas into policy, this is 
                      a perspective that Citizen's Income advocates ignore at

                      a time when the United States contemplates political life 
                      after Bush, the USBIG network held its 7th Annual Congress 
                      at the Park Plaza Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts on the 
                      aptly themed topic 'Framing a BIG Discussion for the Next 
                      Election and Beyond'. As before, the conference was organised 
                      as part of the Eastern Economics Associaton (EEA) annual 
                      meeting.<br>

                      congress featured the usual mixture of academics, policy 
                      analysts and grassroots activists that USBIG aficionados 
                      have come to appreciate. In the context of USBIG this occasionally 
                      volatile mix always seems to lead to interesting engagement 
                      across the divides. And so it was this time round: USBIG 
                      2008 brought participants the usual mixture of philosophical 
                      reflection and hard-nosed political analysis, flavoured 
                      with a good dose of unabashed optimism that sets apart many

                      and Smith), theoretical reflections about freedom (Widerquist, 
                      Harvey, Howard, Oberman and Jubb) or the religious basis 
                      of the BI proposal (Clark and Farris), to detailed discussions 
                      of BI in various countries, including the US (Sheahan and

                      other topics.<br>

                      want to hear one of BIG's most charismatic advocates link

                      minor point was the comparatively low turnout: it appears 
                      the congress did not really succeed in attracting many of 
                      the regular EEA attendants, which is a bit of a shame. Then 
                      again, the fact that the USBIG session was neatly tucked 
                      away in a corner of a long, winding corridor may well have 
                      had something to do with this. And perhaps the congress 
                      featured rather too many non-US invited speakers: while 
                      a cast dominated by Belgians and Irish speakers may be a 
                      refreshing novelty in Boston, it must at times have come 
                      across as a bit too European for the regular participants. 
                      Nevertheless the USBIG organizing committee is to be congratulated 
                      for yet again bringing us another successful conference.

                      with chapter 2. This will introduce you to a wide variety 
                      of definitions of happiness: from Genovesi's happiness as 
                      social relations (an idea connected to Aristotle's vision 
                      of the virtuous man 'living well' by serving his city), 
                      to Adam Smith's understanding that wealth and happiness 
                      are by no means directly correlated, to Alfred Marshall's 
                      compromise (extreme poverty makes happiness difficult to 
                      achieve), to Bentham's utilitarianism and happiness as psychological 
                      hedonism, and to rational choice theory and the question 
                      of the relationship between happiness and indifference curves. 
                      This chapter, which started life as an article in the <i>Journal 
                      of the History of Economic Thought</i>, concludes with a 
                      series of vital questions, the most important of which is: 
                      'The whole theoretical building of modern economics has 
                      been grounded on the key idea that an increase in wealth 
                      will lead to an increase in wellbeing, or happiness &#133;. 
                      If, instead, having more economic goods does not lead to 
                      well-being but to bad-being, if 'goods' become 'bads' (because 
                      they make living unhappy &#133;.), then the very philosophical 
                      and social bases of the job of the political economist are 
                      called into question' (p.45). This chapter raises all sorts 
                      of interesting questions about the definition of 'happiness' 
                      and the definition of 'economics', as does the book as a 
                      whole - which is why this chapter is a good place to start.<br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clearly 
                      I can't treat each of the twenty-four very different contributions 
                      to this book with the same degree of detail as that. Of 
                      the book as a whole I would say that it really is a treasure-store 
                      of good things, and at the same time it is a deconstruction 
                      of the boundaries we often assume between disciplines. There 
                      is ethics, political economy, history, philosophy, social 
                      science, and theology ('God, 115' ought to be in the index). 
                      There is much discussion of the meaning of 'happiness' and 
                      of its relationship to 'choice', 'preference', 'pleasure', 
                      etc. (and maybe there should have been more discussion of 
                      the meaning of 'economics'), and there is debate of various 
                      paradoxes of happiness (e.g., pp.233ff) and particularly 
                      of the finding that in developed countries increased income 
                      does not result in increased happiness. On why this might 
                      be the case chapter 13 argues that technological innovation 
                      makes nonrelational goods cheaper in relation to relational 
                      goods - and if, as many of the chapters suggest, it is such 
                      relational goods as time with friends, places to meet, the 
                      arts, etc. which generate happiness (understood as social 
                      and public happiness) then happiness will decline and individual 
                      hedonism will increase.<br>
                      Whether you're looking for economic realities expressed 
                      through mathematical formulae, classical history, Immanuel 
                      Kant's ethics, or sustainable development, there's something 
                      here for you.<br>
                      No short book review can do justice to this wide-ranging 
                      and thought-provoking collection. I suggest that you read 
                      it. I wouldn't recommend that you buy it: you can probably 
                      see why. Ask your library to obtain it, and then borrow 
                      it.<br>

                      for the EU to establish a social protection policy agenda 
                      alongside the very different national systems. Such a two-tier

                      book is a study of how lone mothers in Germany (where 20% 
                      of mothers are lone mothers) and in Britain (25%) understand 
                      themselves as carers, dependents or paid workers in relation 
                      to the welfare state, and it reveals a wide diversity of 
                      experience, suggesting that to define lone mothers as a 
                      single category might not be the best route to understanding 
                      a complex situation. The study reveals several contradictions, 
                      and in particular that between the welfare state as an instrument 
                      of oppression and the welfare state as an escape from both 
                      private patriarchy (the male-dominated family) and public

                      shows that many lone mothers in poverty engineer rich social 
                      lives for themselves and their children, and that many poor 
                      mothers end up better off financially when they leave a 
                      marriage; and more generally she finds that lone mothers 
                      are firmly part of late modernity's trend towards an individualization 
                      in the context of which people create their own destinies 
                      and thus a 'reflexive modernity'. <br>

                      book will be of use both to those with a particular interest 
                      in lone motherhood and to those with an interest in broader 
                      social trends, because each chapter relates to Klett-Davies' 
                      study of 70 lone mothers and also to important concepts, 
                      theories and institutions. Chapter 2 rehearses a variety 
                      of social science discourses ('social threat', 'social problem', 
                      etc.); chapter 3 discusses late modernity and individualization; 
                      and chapter 4 lone mothers' relationships to the welfare 
                      state in Germany and Britain. The author shows how the British 
                      Government's benefits, taxation and active labour market 
                      policies position lone mothers as employees rather than 
                      as caregivers and at the same time punishes them in the 
                      labour market with a severe poverty trap (pp.46ff). Policy 
                      on the family has become an arm of employment policy (p.48). 
                      Klett-Davies' solution is 1. a Citizen's Income and 2. men 
                      becoming more competent in flexible paid work as well as 
                      in care and family work (p.49).<br>

                      5 records lone mothers' experience of paid employment (they 
                      see themselves primarily as mothers and see employment as 
                      both a means to that end and as a preparation for post-childcare 
                      employment). Chapter 6 discusses the use of type categories 
                      in social research such as this study and formulates variables 
                      to enable lone mothers to be categorised; and the following 
                      chapters record the experiences of mothers the author has 
                      placed in the categories she develops: 'pioneers', 'copers', 
                      'strugglers', and 'borderliners'. The final chapter discusses 
                      differences between the experiences of German and British 
                      lone mothers (more changes occur with the age of the child 
                      in Germany than in Britain) and suggests policy implications 
                      of the research results. The policy suggestions are in the 
                      fields of employment, childrearing, and education. The suggestions 
                      made in ch.4 in relation to the benefits and tax system 
                      are not reiterated here, and they should have been. A final 
                      section returns to the notion of individualization as a 
                      means to understand a complex picture.<br>

                      rights advocates claim that government regulation, taxation

                      Where do these rights come from, and do they come with responsibilities? 
                      The detailed argument for strong <i>private</i> property 
                      rights relies on two important claims. (1) Property began 
                      as private property; governments interfered with it later. 
                      (2) Private property hurts no one; everyone today is better

                      How do we know everyone is better off today? These claims 
                      do not hold up in the light of evidence which have I found 
                      in anthropological studies, including <i>Stone Age Economics</i> 
                      by Marshall Sahlins (1974), <i>Bronze Age Economics</i> 
                      and <i>How Chiefs Come to Power</i> by Timothy Earle (1997;

                      the earliest agricultural societies land was owned (if at 
                      all) by villages or large extended families with each individual 
                      having the right to use it. In societies where property 
                      rights had become exclusive, the original owners were not 
                      businessmen but chiefs. Ownership of resources was synonymous 
                      with ownership of the government, because early economies 
                      were too simple to support separate spheres of power such 
                      as government, religion, and business. All of these powers 
                      were usually vested in one person. The Hawaiian Islands 
                      provide a relatively recent example of the creation of property 
                      rights. After the first few centuries of human settlement, 
                      each major Hawaiian Island was run by a chief whose authority 
                      came from his ownership of land and irrigation systems. 
                      Chiefs appointed local lords to allocate land to peasants 
                      in exchange for service to the chief. In short, each chief 
                      ran his island as a for-profit business.<br>

                      rights advocates sometimes claim that only recent history 
                      matters, but taxation is not new. Government taxation is 
                      simply the exercise of a right that Western governments 
                      have held since they were kingdoms. Western private property 
                      rights were created when the titles of medieval vassals 
                      gradually became tradable. If the property rights system 
                      that the king set up is unjust, his rights belong to his 
                      people, not to the people who hold the titles he bestowed.

                      the king's power to tax his title holders has about as much 
                      to do with 'freedom from interference' as redistribution 
                      from landlords to tenants or stockholders to management.<br>
                      Property rights advocates' second claim (that a capitalist 
                      economy makes everyone better off than a hunter-gatherer 
                      economy) can be informed by observations of hunter-gatherer 
                      communities that survived into modern times. Stone Age people 
                      from the arctic to the tropics lived surprisingly carefree 
                      lives. They worked an average of three to four hours per 
                      day (including commuting and cooking). They slept more than 
                      we do. They appeared to feel secure about their ability 
                      to always find necessities. They worked at their own pace, 
                      and they <i>never</i> had to answer to a boss. No one gave 
                      orders and no one was excluded from the resources they needed 
                      to survive.<br>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      average modern worker has more access to luxuries, better 
                      medical care, and a longer life expectancy than a hunter-gatherer. 
                      But he or she works longer and harder, follows orders, and 
                      has less economic security. Even though the <i>average</i> 
                      modern worker lives longer, some die younger of preventable 
                      complications of poverty such as malnutrition and exposure. 
                      In short, the transition from hunter-gatherer society to 
                      modern capitalism has not been an unequivocal improvement; 
                      it has been a tradeoff. But a tradeoff is not good enough 
                      to meet the standards that property rights advocates set 
                      for themselves.<br>

                      least as well off as their Stone Age ancestors. Property 
                      rights advocates chose it because they thought it was easy 
                      to meet. It is. A society, as productive as ours, can easily 
                      make everyone far better off than they would be as hunter-gatherers. 
                      To do so, we need to make sure that everyone has access 
                      to some minimally acceptable standard of living without 
                      having to follow anyone's orders. Perhaps we can require 
                      them to take orders if they want to share the luxuries that 
                      capitalism produces, but we should recognize, as our Stone 
                      Age ancestors did, that it is wrong for anyone to come between 
                      a human being and the resources she needs to survive.<br>

                      unconditional basic income guarantee might be the only policy 
                      that can do that. The only way to live in modern society 
                      without being subject to some else's orders is to have money. 
                      We, the better off, haven't done even the least we can do 
                      to justify our property rights, because we have convinced 
                      ourselves that we have the right to boss around the poor. 
                      We have property, and they don't; therefore, supposedly, 
                      we have the right to make them do what we say for 40 hours 
                      per week. Yet, anthropological evidence shows that our property 
                      rights come between the poor and their ability to meet their 
                      own needs with surprisingly little effort. Even by the standards 
                      set by property rights advocates-the poor do not owe us 
                      anything; we owe them.<br>
