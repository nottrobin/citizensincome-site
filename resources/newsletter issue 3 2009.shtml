                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      recent publication, <i>The Spirit Level: Why More Equal 
                      Societies Almost Always Do Better</i>, by Richard Wilkinson 
                      and Kate Pickett (Allen Lane, 2009), identifies some of 
                      the ill effects of unequal incomes. These are literally 
                      ill effects, because by amassing vast quantities of data 
                      on incomes and health the authors have convincingly shown 
                      that inequality breeds ill health, and particularly poor 
                      psychological health. Japan and Scandinavia experience the 
                      lowest inequality and also the best psychological health. 
                      Portugal, the USA and the UK boast the highest inequality 
                      and the worst health outcomes and social problems. What 
                      is particularly interesting is that in unequal societies 
                      such problems afflict the rich as well as the poor.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      authors suggest that the situation could be remedied both 
                      by making earned incomes less unequal (for instance, through 
                      changes in the National Minimum Wage and in the management 
                      of companies) and by redistributing incomes after they've 
                      been earned. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      Citizen's income would of course tackle the problem from 
                      several directions at once:</font></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
                        would provide an automatic income floor and thus reduce 
                        the anxiety which the authors identify as prevalent in 
                        unequal societies; </font></li>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">it 
                        would redistribute income from rich to poor (and a particular 
                        scheme which the Citizen's Income Trust has costed (<i>Citizen's 
                        Income Newsletter</i>, issue 3 for 2004) showed increases 
                        of 25% in the incomes of the lowest earnings decile and 
                        decreases of 4% in the incomes of the highest, and a smooth 
                        curve between the two); </font></li>
                      <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">and 
                        it would reduce social inequality by treating everybody 
                        the same (rather than, as at present, treating people 
                        on means tested benefits and tax credits in one way and 
                        people paying income tax in another).</font></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
                      we are serious about ending the inequality which is clearly 
                      such a blight on the health of our society, then such a 
                      feasible and desirable option as a Citizen's Income really 
                      does need to be given a try. </font><br>

                      February and March of 2009 the Citizen's Income Trust organised 
                      a series of academic seminars on the theme of 'A Citizen's 
                      Income for All?', in close collaboration with four UK universities. 
                      The purpose of the seminars was to showcast recent developments 
                      in research around universal income maintenance proposals 
                      and, along the way, giving another boost to the idea that 
                      citizen's income (CI) schemes are a policy worth considering 
                      in the UK context, a task to which CIT has devoted much 
                      effort in the past two decades.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                      were delighted that our plans were greeted with much enthusiasm 
                      by a number of academic departments across the UK, who were 
                      eager to host a CIT talk as part of their regular seminar 
                      series. In the end four events were scheduled to take place 
                      in Newport, York, Nottingham and Belfast. Unfortunately, 
                      Tony Fitzpatrick's talk on 'Basic Income and Paternalism', 
                      due to take place on 10th February at the University of 
                      Wales, Newport, had to be cancelled due to a snow storm. 
                      The three other talks, however, went ahead as scheduled, 
                      and brief reports on each can be read below.</font></p>

                      Bill Jordan (University of Plymouth), 'Citizen's Income 
                      and the Crash: Credit, Debt and the Citizen's Income', held

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                      his talk Bill Jordan presented a wide-ranging discussion 
                      on the nature of banking, credit and the National Debt. 
                      He compared the current crisis with that of the late 1920s, 
                      and asked whether distributing a Citizen's Income (CI) might 
                      not have had a better effect on stimulating the economy 
                      than paying the banks. Bill queried the possibility of a 
                      welfare and tax reform being undertaken during the current 
                      crisis, given that a crisis is a propitious time for reform. 
                      He decided probably not, although the crisis had led recently 
                      to an increased winter fuel payment for pensioners. Quoting 
                      George Monbiot, he pointed out that local currencies, based 
                      on a token system, are beneficial especially during a financial 
                      crisis, because they recharge local economies.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      roots of CI in the UK can be traced to Quakers Dennis Milner 
                      and Bertram Pickard at the end of World War I, but their 
                      proposal was rejected by the Liberal Party in 1921. Clifford 
                      H. Douglas, an engineer, suggested Social Credit in the 
                      1920s, distributing part of the national product as a National 
                      Dividend. He received support from John Hargreaves, the 
                      charismatic leader of a group calling themselves the Kindred 
                      of the Kibukift, which Hargreaves then turned into a Social 
                      Credit movement. Social Credit Parties were set up in Australia, 
                      New Zealand and Canada between the wars.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill 
                      compared the causes of the financial crisis of 1929 with 
                      the present global economic crash, precipitated again by 
                      a failure of the financial systems in the USA and UK. In 
                      1929, it was preceded by a credit bubble, (the dispersal 
                      of which was recommended by CH Douglas), but the motor for 
                      the 1929 crash was industry, rather than housing.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill 
                      traced the root of the recent crash to a disastrously erroneous 
                      model of governance and public finance, based on a theory 
                      of contracts, information and incentives, and embracing 
                      the whole relationship between citizens and the state. He 
                      pointed to the Labour Party's Third Way, which in 1998 continued 
                      the social contract ideas, based on reciprocity, of the 
                      previous administrations. Increased choice was supposed 
                      to lead to increased incentives. However, markets are those 
                      pricing systems with the least obligation on the part of 
                      the consumer. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      recent crash was preceded by a shares-bubble, a credit-bubble 
                      and a house price-bubble, with credit in the central role. 
                      The banks expanded their production of credit to repay loans, 
                      now barely regulated by official controls, and the West 
                      borrowed heavily from the emergent industrialised economies 
                      of Russia, India, Brazil, and particularly from China. It 
                      was an enormous pyramid system. The global consequences 
                      have been severe, even for prudent economies, and especially 
                      for savers. Profits had been privatised, but now losses 
                      are being socialised.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      CI proposal offers a way forward, allowing a new organisation 
                      of sustainable work and improved well-being, as well as 
                      equality and fairness between members of our society. Its 
                      emphasis is more on relationship, and less on production, 
                      embodying the feminine ethic of care, and nurturing the 
                      environment. CI promotes well-being, sharing out both unpaid 
                      and paid work, and the proceeds of paid work, thus dispelling 
                      the 'dependency culture'. It promotes solidarity and community, 
                      together with sustainability in both environmental and social 
                      terms. According to Philippe Van Parijs, it has more to 
                      do with identity and actualisation than with greed. A CI 
                      creates new opportunities.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During 
                      the lively question period, the audience queried whether 
                      a CI system leads to enhanced equality and autonomy within 
                      both the nuclear and the extended family, compared with 
                      societies that rely on family for poverty relief. A CI system 
                      (without work tests) was in direct contradiction to recent 
                      white and green Government papers, which emphasised conditionality 
                      for lone parents and people with disabilities. However, 
                      unemployment has increased, so the move has been self-defeating. 
                      If the government wishes people to spend in order to boost 
                      the economy, it should give them the money and reduce prices.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Bill's 
                      relaxed delivery and discursive style, backed up by impressively 
                      wide reading, probably posed more questions than it provided 
                      answers, but was none the worse for that. We left trying 
                      to make a picture from the many jigsaw pieces presented 
                      to us in the course of the seminar, but feeling satisfied 
                      by the very stimulating and enjoyable experience.</font></p>

                      Louise Haagh (University of York), 'Citizen's Income, Varieties 
                      of Capitalism and Occupational Freedom' held on 10th March 
                      2009, University of Nottingham</b></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Louise 
                      Haagh's talk provided a critical account of basic income 
                      discourse, and advocated a clearer focus on what Citizen's 
                      Income (CI) is for, in order to judge its relationship to 
                      paid work and other institutions of universalised welfare. 
                      There is not just one type of capitalism, but each is particular 
                      to its social and cultural environment. She suggested that 
                      many of the claims of CI analysis were too ambitious, since 
                      they did not take account of their social institutions and 
                      political contexts. Her aim was to warn supporters of CI 
                      to beware of the pitfalls that exist. In particular, the 
                      objectives must be examined to see whether they fit with 
                      current political and social institutions.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Louise 
                      focused on choice through the 'control of one's own time' 
                      as a source of occupational freedom. She pointed out that, 
                      although many supporters of CI take an underlying free market 
                      economy as given, a CI system would have to be underpinned 
                      by the right to structured work. There will also be a need 
                      for social finance for, and organisation of, schooling, 
                      employment transitions, care and the regulation of work 
                      time; leading to three paradoxes in this regard: control, 
                      politics, and justice.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Louise 
                      criticised those supporters of CI who do not separate their 
                      argument for CI from an abstract libertarian defence of 
                      political freedom. They often appear to show a disdain for 
                      socialised work and those who perform it. She distinguished 
                      between the 'crazies' who work very long and hard in a few 
                      highly paid jobs, and the 'lazies' who work less hard for 
                      less pay. This distinction is more marked in deregulated 
                      economies. It is important to diminish the distinctions 
                      of status, and allow all work to have equal priority. Paid 
                      work is a privilege, and those fortunate to be gainfully 
                      employed have obligations to compensate those who do not. 
                      Changes in technology have not led to a reduction in the 
                      need for paid work, but strong institutions are needed to 
                      create jobs. An important advantage of a CI scheme is that 
                      it can help to achieve a more equal balance of paid work, 
                      leisure and care in each person's life.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
                      are three domains where the social function - the organisation 
                      of choice - is central to allow balanced control over one's 
                      own time: education, employment and leisure. Unequal education 
                      and deregulation of paid work lead to a reinforcing cycle 
                      of wage dispersion that provides incentives to seek to purchase 
                      premier education for one's offspring. Or as Louise put 
                      it, 'where inequality begins to emerge in positional goods, 
                      public spending becomes less effective'. Louise presented 
                      a series of tables comparing OECD economies, which revealed 
                      several facts about social choice in respect to overall 
                      control over one's own time. Important observations included 
                      that 1) equal schooling and generous income-support are 
                      positively related; 2) evidence suggests that educational 
                      inequalities are growing in some countries; and 3) the UK 
                      has both the highest level of educational inequalities, 
                      and highest growth in inequality of income of the OECD countries. 
                      Countries have a choice between supporting individuals, 
                      or monitoring and controlling them, and the UK has the highest 
                      level of control of any OECD country.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Louise 
                      next pointed out that there is a broad link between average 
                      annual leisure hours and the employment system. In an article 
                      published in 2001, Robert Goodin showed that, in the Dutch 
                      post-productivist economy, leisure hours were associated 
                      with a high share of part-time work. This has been referred 
                      to as 'women's freedom to care', and is similar to the argument 
                      that CI supports carers. This creates a problem, because 
                      it would appear that women have to choose between 'care' 
                      and 'career', because they are at a competitive disadvantage 
                      in the work place, especially in deregulated economies.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                      conclusion, Louise emphasized the importance of the structure 
                      of social insurance and particularly of a progressive system 
                      of taxation. This is necessary for achieving a more even 
                      structure of opportunities, and thus to a reduction in the 
                      inequality of incomes, all leading to one having more control 
                      over one's time. In UK, we have the paradoxical situation 
                      of experiencing both income insecurity and state control. 
                      As for the question whether a CI is likely to be instituted 
                      in the UK in the near future, one hopes that a clearer path 
                      toward this goal will emerge now that the pitfalls in the 
                      discourse on CI are clearly outlined.</font></p>

                      Basic Capital: Can We Resolve the Disagreement?' held on 
                      20th March 2009, Queen's University Belfast</b></font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stuart 
                      White delivered a thought-provoking presentation on a topic 
                      on which he is one of the world's leading experts, the similarities 
                      and distinctions between basic income (BI) policies and 
                      basic capital (BC) grants. The debate of the past decade 
                      amongst advocates of the 'Citizen Endowment Thesis' (the 
                      idea that all citizens are entitled, as of right, to a certain 
                      endowment of resources, without any means test or labour 
                      contribution) has been concentrating on the question whether 
                      we should hand out such an endowment in the form of a periodic 
                      (non-mortgageable) basic income or rather as a one-off lump-sum 
                      grant, paid to the individual on reaching maturity.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
                      some advocates (and perhaps even opponents) may think this 
                      is merely a practical matter, Stuart believes there are 
                      genuine ethical considerations to take into account as well. 
                      For instance, as Stuart rightly pointed out, important comparability 
                      problems emerge when attempting to evaluate the pros and 
                      cons of the standard BI and BC proposals. Specifically, 
                      the present discounted value of BI and BC will be different, 
                      and it is not clear what amounts to a fair comparison in 
                      that regard. Further, differences in the financing of either 
                      scheme as well as different options in terms of substituting 
                      for existing expenditures make the comparability of BI and 
                      BC almost intractable. Perhaps a normative account of the 
                      relevant differences between these two schemes might offer 
                      some answers, and Stuart's talk proceeded to outline several 
                      lines of argument to that effect by introducing a key distinction 
                      between equality-based and freedom-based arguments for BI 
                      and BC.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Equality-based 
                      arguments typically focus on 'inherited external assets' 
                      which are to be divided equally, typically by taxing their 
                      full market value and distributing this in the form of a 
                      uniform grant. Stuart pointed out that there are a number 
                      of complications that need to be resolved (most importantly 
                      which resources qualify to be shared equally without any 
                      further conditions), but the main question is whether the 
                      equality argument favours BI over BC, or the converse. One 
                      reason to think equality favours BC is to consider the objection 
                      that a BI would distribute resources unequally in cases 
                      where some individuals live longer than others: if I live 
                      25 years longer than you, the BI that I receive during those 
                      25 'extra' years will obviously be substantially larger 
                      than the BI you received during your lifetime. By contrast, 
                      equality might favour BI because it better tracks the changing 
                      market value of external resources: whereas a one-off grant 
                      will have its value fixed, a regular BI can be easily adjusted 
                      to accommodate increases (or decreases) in value of the 
                      resources that provide the foundation for the grant.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So 
                      far it would seem, on equality grounds, both BI and BC score 
                      equally. But Stuart thinks quite a different equality argument 
                      can be found when thinking in terms of social equality, 
                      which is the equality in social relations rather than pure 
                      distributions of resources. And here, Stuart thinks BI seems 
                      more effective in terms of promoting social equality by 
                      constraining the dependencies that arise through labour 
                      market competition and so on. A BC might offer better immediate 
                      opportunities, but once the grant has 'expired' - whether 
                      because of our own actions or through sheer bad luck - we 
                      remain vulnerable to the very social forces that a regular 
                      BI is able to counter. This of course brings us very close 
                      to the second line of argument, which suggests a BI or BC 
                      must in the first instance protect individuals' primary 
                      interest in freedom. Here again, Stuart again finds that 
                      some variants favour BI while others favour BC.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps 
                      one of the most controversial insights of Stuart's talk 
                      was the extent to which the freedom-based arguments must 
                      engage with paternalistic considerations. Although CI advocates 
                      are notoriously averse to even a whiff of paternalism, Stuart 
                      convincingly demonstrated that some of the arguments in 
                      favour of BI over BC in fact depend on a solid dose of paternalism. 
                      Even more surprising there might be a paternalistic argument 
                      favouring BC, in that we could argue it would be most sensible 
                      for individuals to avoid choosing either BI or BC and instead 
                      opt for a combined scheme. This then leads up to Stuart's 
                      positive case for hybridity, in which BI plays a crucial 
                      role in preventing vulnerability which BC takes the primary 
                      role in ensuring (equal) opportunity. For Stuart, forcing 
                      the matter as an either/or is simply to ignore the benefits 
                      of instituting both simultaneously; benefits that are supported 
                      both on grounds of equality and freedom.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
                      with the other seminars, Stuarts' provocative talk lead 
                      to numerous questions and a very engaging debate. Participants 
                      queried some of the assumptions or argument internal to 
                      either the equality- or freedom-based perspectives, while 
                      others wondered which of these argumentative strategies 
                      is most promising in terms of settling the debate. Others 
                      again suggested that, while the internal debate between 
                      BI and BC is interesting, there remains much work to be 
                      done convincing UK citizens (and politicians) that the starting 
                      point of a set of external resources that ought to be shared 
                      equally, without means test or labour contribution, is valid 
                      in the first place. These concerns notwithstanding, there 
                      was unanimous agreement that Stuart's talk gave us much 
                      to think about, and no doubt will require following-up at 
                      another opportunity.</font></p>

                      most effective policy is simply to distribute the revenues 
                      to the population: 'The solution is simple but radical: 
                      distribute extractive revenues directly and equally to all 
                      citizens. Instead of fighting each other for oil rents, 
                      political elites would have to bargain with the people for 
                      tax revenues. If the government did not tax everything back,

                      pensioner poverty in Great Britain. 'The reforms to state 
                      pensions introduced in the Pensions Act 2007 will reduce

                      Some other inequalities will remain, as a large part of

                      Individuals with low earnings and/or career breaks not covered

                      Child Poverty: a manifesto for success</i>: 'There are still 
                      nearly 4 million children living in poverty in Britain today. 
                      The Government has promised to eradicate child poverty by 
                      2020 and we cannot afford to fail. In today's difficult 
                      economic climate, our manifesto calls for immediate action 
                      to help employers protect jobs. The income safety net must 
                      be mended; and greater use made of universal benefits in 
                      tandem with progressive taxation, rather than over-reliance 
                      on means testing and accumulation of excessive wealth at 
                      the top. &#133;&#133; As we look ahead to the years between 
                      now and 2020, we know that our country will be judged not 
                      just on whether we can rebuild an ailing economy, but on 
                      whether we build it as a fair economy: an economy that makes 
                      child poverty a thing of the past &#133; Non-means-tested 
                      support, such as Child Benefit, is typically better delivered 
                      and does not suffer the stigma often attached to means-tested 
                      support. CPAG believes it is time to raise family incomes 
                      of the poorest and, within this, to increase the proportion 
                      of non-means-tested financial support. The UK social security 
                      system is complex, with the result that quality of administration 
                      is often low. Both claimant and official error rates are 
                      high, meaning that those entitled find it difficult to realise 
                      their rights. The use of a test of means as a mechanism 
                      to establish entitlement generates inherent complexity. 
                      Evidence to the Work and Pensions Select Committee inquiry 
                      suggested 'a direct correlation between the amount of means-testing 
                      and the complexity in the system'. Child Benefit is popular 
                      and functions effectively because it is simple to understand 
                      and, because it is usually well administered and has a very 
                      high take-up rate, it actually reaches more children living 
                      in poverty than the more targeted Child Tax Credit. As Child 
                      Benefit is not means-tested, it is not withdrawn as parents 
                      earn more and so it supports moves into employment. Means-tested 
                      benefits worsen the poverty trap because they are withdrawn 
                      as earnings rise. In recent years, the cash value of child 
                      benefit has been raised in a variety of ways. First, by 
                      an increase in the amount paid for the first child in 1999, 
                      then by a smaller increase in January 2009 by extending 
                      it back into pregnancy (through the health in pregnancy 
                      grant), disregarding Child Benefit in the assessment of 
                      Council Tax Benefit and housing benefit, and by extending 
                      entitlement for some older children near school completion 
                      age (or in training). Each of these is welcome, but more 
                      can be done with this popular benefit to galvanise public 
                      support for investing in children' (quoted from the introduction

                      to any change in the economic conjuncture. The case of the

                      to meet his/her needs, on the assumption that the shortfall 
                      can be made up from other sources, particularly earnings. 
                      (A PCI may go some way to satisfy those who would prefer 
                      a participation income scheme, because the PCI provides 
                      the incentive to top up one's CI from earnings. It could 
                      produce the same effect as a participation income, but without 
                      the control and coercion that seems to be an integral part 
                      of participation income schemes.) Even on a flat tax rate 
                      of between 0.40 and 0.50, many a recipient would face a 
                      lower income tax rate than the current high effective marginal

                        aged 0-15 inclusive would receive a Child CI (CCI), and 
                        a Parent-with-Care (PwC), usually the mother, would not 
                        be expected to have to top up her CI to meet her MIS, 
                        (although she would be entitled to earn extra if she wished). 
                        She would receive a FCI, in recognition of her time, physical 
                        and emotional efforts, and constraints on her life due 
                        to child-rearing responsibilities. A Lone Parent (LP) 
                        and the PwC in a two-adult household would receive the 
                        same amount, and it would have to be sufficient to meet 
                        the greater MIS of the LP. This would remove the odious 
                        and intrusive cohabitation rule, and a PwC would not have 
                        to inform the authorities every time her status as a LP 
                        or cohabit&eacute;e changed. This arrangement would infringe 
                        the idea of a 'pure CI scheme', because this FCI is contingent 
                        on an activity status, or unpaid work status. However, 
                        it is also a matter of justice, that a PwC should receive 
                        more than a working-age adult without care responsibilities.</font></li>

                      This is contentious between organisations working on behalf 
                      of people with disabilities, and organisations for carers. 
                      Even if a package covering constant care is organised for, 
                      and administered by, the person with the disabilities, s/he

                      care for him/her, but the carer of last resort is likely 
                      to be a member of the household, who would <i>de facto</i> 
                      have to take on the responsibilities when paid carers are 
                      sick or on holiday. It is assumed here that a member of 
                      the household would be designated as carer, and receive 
                      a Full CI in return for accepting 'carer-of-last-resort' 
                      status.</font></p>

                      tables 2 and 3 below, each level of CI is expressed as a 
                      proportion of GDP per capita, (<i>The Blue Book 2008</i>, 
                      Tables 1.2 and 1.5). If CI levels are expressed in this 
                      way for all countries, it facilitates a comparison of the 
                      generosity of each country's proposed or actual scheme, 
                      although it ignores access to public services such as education 
                      and health. However, in order to translate this into a personal 
                      income tax rate, it is necessary to relate GDP to 'The Total 
                      Resources of Households and Non-Profit Institutions Serving 
                      Households, NPISH', (<i>The Blue Book 2008</i>, Table 6.1.3). 
                      This is the potential TAX-BASE, when there are no personal 
                      tax allowances, tax reliefs, exemptions or other tax expenditures. 
                      (This reclaims the tax base, and allows a lower income tax 
                      rate to be levied than otherwise.) TAX-BASE divided by the 
                      population gives the average personal income for the UK, 
                      which is referred to here as Y-BAR, and this is used to 
                      calculate the personal income tax rate necessary to finance 
                      the given CI scheme, (see Miller 2006, for the argument 
                      underlying this approach). It is assumed that the same proportions 
                      of GDP per capita for FCI, PCI and CCI would be applied 
                      each year of a government's administration, using the most 
                      recently available figures for GDP, population, TAXBASE 
                      and Y-BAR. Adopting the same proportions each year should 
                      have the added advantage of providing a stabilising effect 
                      on the UK's economic cycles. <i>The Blue Book 2008</i> gives 
                      GDP and GDP per capita figures for 2007, on which CIs for 
                      2009-10 could be based.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
                      is assumed here that the CI scheme is funded by a hypothecated 
                      personal income taxation system, (where employees' National 
                      Insurance contributions are subsumed into the income tax 
                      system), partly because benefits and personal taxation are 
                      reverse sides of the same coin. A hypothecated system also 
                      helps one to consider what is feasible in terms of the cost, 
                      as it measures the direct impact on the population, and 
                      again facilitates international comparisons. Of course, 
                      other methods of financing a CI scheme can also be explored. 
                      Most of government expenditure (as opposed to transfers) 
                      has been of the same order of magnitude as the tax revenue 
                      from other types of taxes in the UK (see Miller, 2006).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      flat tax (or proportional tax) is assumed here, mainly for 
                      convenience, because it is easier to calculate the tax revenue 
                      yielded than that from a progressive scheme, where one would 
                      need far more information about the distribution of the 
                      gross income. It would not preclude higher rates of income 
                      tax being imposed at higher income levels, when the time 
                      came for implementation. Obviously a progressive system 
                      would be more just, and in Scandinavian countries, tax rates 
                      of around 0.65 are not unknown. But, even a flat tax coupled 
                      with a CI scheme can be a very effective method of reducing 
                      income inequality. A flat-rate tax is often proposed for 
                      political expediency, because it is thought that it might 
                      be easier to sell to those who would otherwise be hit by 
                      a progressive scheme. A standard flat rate of income tax 
                      will be calculated, which would be levied on personal income 
                      from all sources, which will be that required to finance 
                      the CI scheme.</font></p>

                      a simple Citizen's Income scheme, such as the example above, 
                      if it were to be financed solely from a flat-rate personal 
                      income tax (assuming that National Insurance contributions

                      face a lower effective marginal tax rate of 0.42, instead 
                      of the high combined income tax rate and benefit withdrawal

                      of those receiving only a PCI, who live in areas where there 
                      are few opportunities even for part-time work, would face 
                      a problem. Maybe this could be addressed in the short-run, 
                      by offering a Housing Benefit scheme, to top up their incomes. 
                      It would be part of the safety net necessary for those who 
                      do not qualify for a CI, or who are deemed to be in poverty 
                      in spite of it. If the CI scheme has the effect of redistributing 
                      to, and thus regenerating, run down areas in the medium 
                      term, as hoped, work opportunities would be increased. The 
                      shortfall in the MIS for those living alone with PCIs is 
                      (&pound;210.65 - &pound;88.23) pw = &pound;122.42 pw. Even 
                      where there is work, unskilled people on a minimum wage

                      would take 35 hours per week to earn this. The granting 
                      of a Housing Benefit (of &pound;52.30 as stated in the MIS 
                      schedule) would reduce it to 20 hours per week. Sharing 
                      housing would also help to reduce the short fall. A student 
                      living on his/her own would be in the same situation, but 
                      many are likely to be living in their parental homes, or 
                      sharing with other students. The maximum student loan for 
                      maintenance for the 2009-10 academic year, for a student 
                      from England or Wales living away from home (except for 
                      those in London), will be &pound;4,950. This is 0.28 of 
                      Y-BAR, compared with 0.26 from the PCI.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An 
                      alternative rate for the PCI might be considered, if it 
                      were thought that the PCI should not be less than that which 
                      an unemployed, single, working-age adult receives already 
                      in the form of state benefits, ie Job Seeker's Allowance 
                      in 2009-10 of &pound;64.30 pw plus Housing Benefit, assumed 
                      here to be &pound;52.30 pw. (PCI = &pound;116.60 pw or &pound;6,079.86 
                      pa). This represents 0.3436 of Y-BAR. If the PCI were increased 
                      to 0.345, (&pound;117.00 pw or &pound;6,100.71 pa), it would 
                      increase the required income tax rate by 0.032, (see the 
                      Table 3 below), that is, the relevant income tax rate would 
                      increase to approximately 0.452. Note that two-adult households 
                      with children would gain disproportionately from such a 
                      move.</font></p>

                      second option would be to allow an earnings-disregard of 
                      &pound;122.17 pw (&pound;6,370 pa, or 0.36 of Y-BAR) for 
                      those receiving a PCI (or even a CCI), such that each pays 
                      zero tax on their gross income (excluding the CI), until 
                      the net income (including the CI) reaches the MIS rate of 
                      0.62 Y-BAR, ie. &pound;210.40 pw (&pound;10,971 pa). (A 
                      PCI with an earnings disregard is beginning to look even 
                      more like a participation income than does a PCI without 
                      one, again without the control or coercion). A ballpark 
                      figure for the maximum loss of tax revenue from adult earnings 
                      only, (by assuming that all adults would earn at least &pound;6,370), 
                      can be gained from (0.3788 x 0.36 x 0.42) = 0.05727. It 
                      can be shown by using a more accurate method that the earnings 
                      disregard could add an extra 0.06 to the flat-rate tax, 
                      (for the method, see Miller, 2008). An earnings disregard 
                      has other disadvantages in addition to the loss of revenue. 
                      These include the complications of administering the tax 
                      system, (such as, is it a weekly disregard or an annual 
                      one?), and the fact that employers operating PAYE schemes 
                      would be able to distinguish between a vulnerable adult 
                      who pays tax and the others who do not. But these are typical 
                      of any progressive scheme.</font></p>

                      assuming that the MIS estimates for a working-age individual

                      for an able-bodied, working-age adult at &pound;210.65 pw, 
                      (0.62 of Y-BAR), the FCI that the former would receive, 
                      at 0.56 of Y-BAR, is less than his/her MIS. Even sharing 
                      with an able-bodied, working-age adult who is not a designated 
                      carer and receives 0.26 of Y-BAR, would not be sufficient 
                      together to reach the MIS (0.91 of Y-BAR) for a two-adult 
                      household. However, many working-age adults with disabilities, 
                      will live in a household with a designated carer, and each 
                      will receive 0.56 of Y-BAR, which together is greater than 
                      the MIS for a two-adult household. So, the question is that 
                      of 'How to address the MIS of the individual with disabilities 
                      living on his/her own?' One answer would be to increase 
                      the FCI for all those with disabilities to 0.62, which would 
                      add 0.0054 to the standard income tax rate, (ie. 0.0902 
                      x 0.06). Another solution would be to expect it to be covered 
                      in the costs-of-disability package that would have to be 
                      worked out for each individual. This would cost less because 
                      it would only affect those living on their own, without 
                      a designated carer. </font></p>

                      of the problems facing any income maintenance scheme is 
                      that of the high housing costs in many parts of the UK. 
                      A CI scheme is not a panacea for all ills, and should not 
                      be expected to cure the problems in the housing market, 
                      which are due to different causes. For instance, these problems 
                      could be addressed directly by regulating the housing market 
                      more tightly, by controlling the amount of mortgages lent 
                      as a proportion of valuation, and limiting mortgages to 
                      only two-and-a-half (or three) times a borrower's income. 
                      Further, if Capital Gains Tax were payable when a home-owner 
                      downsized the value of his/her main home, and other similar 
                      measures were adopted, then perhaps, housing bubbles could 
                      be averted, and houses could become merely homes again, 
                      rather than speculative investments. These measures could 
                      protect new low-cost housing from being bought by wealthy 
                      people as investments. An advantage of the CI scheme is 
                      that it provides an incentive to share accommodation and 
                      reduce the pressure on housing, whereas the present system 
                      has the reverse affect, pushing people apart. </font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      CI scheme put forward meets the MIS of most of the population. 
                      There are concerns about the assumption that able-bodied, 
                      working-age adults without caring responsibilities will 
                      always be able to earn enough to top up their Partial Basic 
                      Incomes to meet their Minimum Income Standard. This is also 
                      true for working-age adults with disabilities. Suggestions 
                      were made for ways to address this. The standard income 
                      tax rate required to finance the scheme in Table 2 is 0.42, 
                      which is feasible. Most individuals with a gross income 
                      of less than &pound;25,000 (in addition to the CI) are likely 
                      to be better off, both in terms of net income, incentives 
                      to work, and the financial autonomy granted by the CI system.

                      is a polemic, and a most effective one. The first part of 
                      its thesis (explored in part I) is that the economic model 
                      of rational individuals choosing how to satisfy their private 
                      desires now controls what we mean by 'welfare' and the means 
                      whereby we provide it, but that this is no way to provide 
                      for well-being. Sociological research has shown that as 
                      income rises, self-assessed well-being rises and then plateaus. 
                      Maximising economic rewards can be a stressful business, 
                      and we don't always choose options in the marketplace which 
                      actually increase well-being - so, as Jordan suggests, 'the 
                      paradox of the present situation, in the affluent Anglophone 
                      countries, is that the economic model is both dominant (as 
                      a basis for public policy, and within the social sciences) 
                      and fragile in the tenability of its fundamental assumptions' 
                      (p.5).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      second element of the thesis (explored in part II) is that 
                      there is another way: a way based on 'social value'. Our 
                      well-being in fact depends on the quality of relationships 
                      and on the culture of the collective in which we live - 
                      and this well-being is itself social: it is the well-being 
                      of populations. The problem is that the culture of our society 
                      is significantly informed by the economic model, so we become 
                      'cultural dopes', unable to escape from this model. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Jordan 
                      employs the term 'welfare' for the individual's utility 
                      maximisation, and thus, in terms of the economic model, 
                      'well-being' is a quality of societies. The former is easier 
                      both to conceptualise and to operationalise. Contracts between 
                      individuals or between individuals and institutions have 
                      consequences which we can fairly easily analyse. A culture 
                      of well-being is rather more difficult both to measure and 
                      to foster. Thus part III of the book asks whether the economic 
                      model of welfare might generate a culture which enhances 
                      social value, thus reconciling welfare and well-being. Jordan 
                      discussions a Citizen's Income (here called a Basic Income) 
                      and suggests that, whilst a Citizen's Income in itself would 
                      not necessarily create a socially-understood well-being, 
                      it could complement the other complex social processes which 
                      might do so. 'The conflicts between the priorities of maximising 
                      the basic income and sustaining the practices and cultures 
                      conducive for well-being would be the new stuff of democratic 
                      politics' (p.243). </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      Citizen's Income is, after all, rooted in liberal individualism, 
                      so it is no surprise that in itself it cannot create social 
                      well-being. What we now need from Bill Jordan is a detailed 
                      examination of the institutional changes which might create 
                      social well-being. He is particularly interested in the 
                      ways in which we care for children and for the elderly, 
                      so a study of how a Citizen's Income might cohere with a 
                      package of policy changes aimed at improving the social 
                      well-being of children and elderly people would be most 
                      informative. If he finds that the necessary changes <i>would</i> 
                      be promoted by a Citizen's Income then, because a Citizen's 
                      Income is rooted in liberal individualism and would enhance 
                      individual choice, and because it is also a <i>feasible</i> 
                      reform (Jordan doesn't discuss feasibility in this book), 
                      then a Citizen's Income would fit his criteria for reform 
                      which would employ the economic model in order to enhance 
                      social value.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                      the end it comes down to what we do with our lives. 'Many 
                      people remain loyal to non-welfarist communal activities 
                      such as crafts, sports, musical styles or outdoor pursuits, 
                      but they are induced to see these as 'lifestyle choices' 
                      rather than essential aspects of well-being' (p.250). Would 
                      a Citizen's Income increase our involvement in such culture-building? 
                      We need to know.</font></p>

                      Act (PRWORA) in 1996 from two perspectives: 1. the public 
                      interest model of government (which assumes that legislators 
                      are motivated by what the public needs), and 2. the public 
                      choice model (which views legislators as actors with their 
                      own rational objectives rather than as servants of a government 
                      seeking agreed allocative or distributive ends). A detailed 
                      exploration of the legislative process leads to the conclusion

                      book starts with a discussion of the welfare provision which 
                      PRWORA replaced and, for comparative purposes, of the welfare 
                      states of Sweden, the UK and Germany. Early on, the impact 
                      of the European Union on European social policy is also 
                      discussed. Both the 'public interest' and 'public choice' 
                      models are described, a public choice model of United States 
                      governance is constructed, and the history of the United 
                      States welfare state (and of its roots in the British system) 
                      is outlined. Then follows a detailed history of PRWORA, 
                      an institutional analysis (a study of the interest groups 
                      which influenced the legislation), and an analysis of welfare 
                      caseloads - and in this context Reintsma concludes that 
                      'the statistical analysis &#133;. provides substantial support 
                      for the public choice argument that the influence of interest 
                      groups on economic policies such as welfare legislation 
                      is both substantial and effective' (p.192).</font></p>

                      reform in the UK. It's easy to see who might benefit from 
                      a system which employs the private sector to provide supervised 
                      activity related to a government policy which sees such 
                      activity as a method for moving people from unemployment 
                      to employment. It is also easy to see that individuals' 
                      work incentives would benefit from a Citizen's Income and 
                      possible to see which interest groups might lose if a Citizen's 
                      Income were to replace Job Seeker's Allowance and its related 
                      programmes. The message of this book is that it isn't the 
                      desirability or the feasibility of a policy that counts. 
                      What matters is which interest groups might gain from the

                      during an economic downturn is just one symptom of the fluid 
                      nature of the relationship between family, the economy and 
                      working life in today's society. In his book Van Dongen 
                      relates a considerable and diverse body of research relevant 
                      to study of the ways we live in different social contexts 
                      (the family, the workplace, public organisations, etc.) 
                      and of the ways in which we integrate the different parts

                      an introductory chapter, in chapter 2 the author outlines 
                      a traditional dual approach to daily life: 1. production 
                      (understood as paid work), and 2. consumption (including 
                      leisure activities and unpaid work in the family and the 
                      community). In terms of this conceptual model the trend 
                      has been towards including more aspects of daily life in 
                      the productive or economic sector.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                      chapter 3 Van Dongen opposes to this traditional dualistic 
                      understanding of daily life a rather different 'integrated 
                      approach to the division of labour' in which 'the daily 
                      life of human subjects is seen as the daily division or 
                      combination of activities or labour processes and of their 
                      outputs/results' (p.27). In this integrated approach, input 
                      capital is understood as combinations of personal, social, 
                      material and financial capital; human labour is the means 
                      of transformation; and outputs are again combinations of 
                      personal, social, material and financial capital. All human 
                      activities are thus understood as complex, and 'the life 
                      course is the 'time path' or 'time road' during which all 
                      individuals are performing different activities, in each 
                      activity transforming the available personal, social, material 
                      and financial capital' (p.31). A particularly instructive 
                      graph on p.34 shows the different allocations of time given 
                      to different categories of activities (leisure, social labour, 
                      personal care, family labour, external education, professional 
                      labour) in different periods of our lives.</font></p>

                      studying a variety of models for understanding the division 
                      of labour in modern welfare states Van Dongen describes 
                      his 'Combination Model', based on a broad understanding 
                      of 'democracy' as including a democratic division of labour

                      beginning. In this chapter the author charts the evolution 
                      from the strong breadwinner model of the 1950s and 1960s 
                      through the moderate breadwinner model of 1970 - 1990 to 
                      the moderate combination model of 1990 - 2005 in which there

                      'nearly all potentially professionally active men and women 
                      combine the basic activities in a balanced way during the 
                      life course, avoiding one of these being threatened or neglected. 
                      During all stages of the life course sufficient time has 
                      to be spent on the different basic activities. So one can 
                      fulfil both professional and family responsibility and can 
                      realise a suitable combination of personal, social, material

                      in chapter 6 'full employment' is defined in terms of both

                      final caveat: the author discusses Citizen's Income (p.255) 
                      only in opposition to his preferred method for maintaining 
                      full employment ('bridge jobs'). It might have been better 
                      to ask what tax and benefits arrangement might best serve 
                      the 'strong democracy' on which the complete combination 
                      model is based. The answer might have been a Citizen's Income 
                      with either a smoothly progressive income tax or a flat 
                      tax - a rather simpler solution than the administratively 
                      complex taxation proposals offered in the book. </font></p>

                      introduction is informed by a broad definition of the welfare 
                      state which includes the activity of voluntary organisations 
                      as well as that of the State. It is in general a judicious 
                      and brief account of the development of the welfare state 
                      in Europe and elsewhere alongside studies in the development 
                      of welfare state theory and typology. The introduction and 
                      the collection as a whole are more present- and future-oriented 
                      than past-oriented. Looking to the future, the editors find 
                      an intriguing connection between religious and social policy 
                      developments and they also discuss the possible effects 
                      on the welfare state of the multi-layered nature of modern 
                      government. Their verdict is that change in the nature of 
                      the State and change in welfare states (in the plural) have 
                      always influenced each other and will continue to do so.</font></p>

                      I starts with papers on the development of welfare state 
                      theory, follows with some classic articles from T.H. Marshall 
                      on citizenship and social class and Richard Titmuss on the 
                      nature of social policy, and then ranges across a variety 
                      of theory types. There is material on structural functionalism 
                      (which sees the welfare state as the solution to problems 
                      emerging from industrialisation at the end of the nineteenth 
                      century), neo-Marxist theories (which ask about the social 
                      function of social policy institutions and how the welfare 
                      state functions in a capitalist state), the 'power resources' 
                      approach (in which the welfare state is a struggle for power 
                      between different social and demographic groups), the welfare 
                      state as the management of risk (which employs both 'insurance' 
                      and 'solidarity' ideas), and a polity-centred and institutional 
                      approach (which asks how and why decisions about welfare 
                      states are made).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Volume 
                      II collects papers on the categorisation of welfare states, 
                      and it starts quite correctly with three chapters from Esping-Andersen's 
                      classic <i>The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism</i>. Bonoli's 
                      and other classifications follow, as does recent work on 
                      East and South-east Asian welfare states. The rest of the 
                      volume is on 'transfigurations': the ways in which the world 
                      is changing and the ways in which this is affecting welfare 
                      states. There are sections on globalization, on post-industrialisation, 
                      on Europeanization (i.e., on how greater European integration 
                      is changing Europe's welfare states), and on whether a global 
                      social policy is emerging.</font></p>

                      III contains an interesting mixture of papers. The first 
                      section contains John Rawls on distributive justice, and 
                      papers on other justifications for the welfare state: for 
                      instance, on the prevention of exploitation and on the satisfaction 
                      of needs. Sections follow on outcomes, trade-offs and dysfunctions, 
                      and human motivation ( - policy-makers now assume that we 
                      are all self-interested agents rather than altruistic contributors 
                      or passive recipients). Finally come chapters on attitudes 
                      to redistribution, on ethics and social diversity, on gender, 
                      and on pensions and the generational contract.</font></p>

                      the introduction in volume I, there is an excellent bibliography 
                      which will be helpful to anyone studying social policy; 
                      and there is a name index, though unfortunately no subject 
                      index. Whilst we recognise that creating subject indexes 
                      takes a huge amount of time ( - the reviewer knows this 
                      from experience) and are often not included in anthologies 
                      such as this, they really are important if volumes like 
                      these are to be maximally useful to students, teachers and 
                      researchers.</font></p>

                      that caveat aside, these really are splendid volumes and 
                      for some time to come they will be essential reading for 
                      anyone seriously interested in welfare states and welfare 
                      state theory. Researchers might not be able to afford their 
                      own sets, but they should certainly ask their university 
                      or departmental library to obtain them.</font></p>

                      the UK the 1995 Jobseekers Act made receipt of benefit dependent 
                      on searching for and accepting available jobs, and the later 
                      New Deal provided work and training opportunities for unemployed 
                      people. Most other European countries have seen similar 
                      changes, the universal aim being to 'activate' and 'reintegrate' 
                      unemployed people.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                      this important book Moreira distinguishes between compulsive 
                      'workfare' and an 'activation' characterised by both positive 
                      and negative incentives, and then explains how such activation 
                      relates to Europe's different minimum income schemes. He 
                      finds particularly interesting the variety of relationships 
                      between rights and responsibilities in the different schemes.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
                      a theoretical level Moreira finds helpful Durkheim's theory 
                      of social justice, in which the individual has a right to 
                      personal development. This requires someone's basic needs 
                      to be met, and it also requires people to exploit their 
                      talents so that other people can develop theirs. This theoretical 
                      position coheres with the more empirical material in the 
                      second part of the book. Here the author tests the hypothesis 
                      that minimum income schemes which promote personal development 
                      are more likely to forge positive relationships between 
                      individuals and the labour market. The author develops indicators 
                      for the extent to which a minimum income scheme respects 
                      a person's right to personal development and also for the 
                      scheme's employment effectiveness and gathers evidence in 
                      relation to the indicators. The evidence doesn't confirm 
                      the hypothesis, but it does show that for the majority of 
                      indicators which measure a scheme's respect for personal 
                      development (adequate income, level of discretion in implementation, 
                      opportunities for employment and training, type of sanctions 
                      applied) both respect for the right to personal development 
                      and employment effectiveness can be found together as characteristics 
                      of a minimum income scheme. Only for one indicator does 
                      this relationship not hold. Only if an individual's right 
                      to choose not to be employed is restricted can a minimum 
                      income scheme combine employment effectiveness with respect 
                      for the right to personal development (measured by the other 
                      indicators). </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, 
                      Moreira suggests that employment and other legislation should 
                      be tested to see whether greater respect for the right to 
                      personal development might lead to greater<i> economic </i>effectiveness.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
                      are two flaws in the argument. Firstly: near the beginning 
                      of the theoretical section Moreira evaluates Van Parijs's 
                      arguments for a Citizen's Income and argues that an unconditional 
                      income unfairly favours those who don't wish to work. It 
                      doesn't, of course. It treats everyone fairly in relation 
                      to the receipt of an income. What does treat unfairly those 
                      who want to work is a means-tested minimum income scheme 
                      which results in 5p of additional net income for every additional 
                      &pound;1 of gross income. Secondly: Moreira doesn't ask 
                      himself about the employment effects of the universal benefit 
                      we do have: Child Benefit. This is the only benefit not 
                      withdrawn as other income rises and it is an important factor 
                      in lone parents' labour market decisions.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      book is a record of important research and the conclusions 
                      are useful, but both the theoretical and the empirical material 
                      relates to the situation as it is rather than asking such 
                      questions as: If marginal deduction rates were to be reduced 
                      by a Citizen's Income replacing means-tested benefits and 
                      tax allowance, then would such a positive employment incentive 
                      make many of today's negative incentives unnecessary? We 
                      need Moreira to exercise his critical intellect and rigorous 
                      methods on such additional questions.</font></p>

                      about those reforms, in their international context. New

                      historical overview gives us an understanding of the dual 
                      nature of social security provision in New Zealand: a Universal 
                      Family Benefit supplemented by income-tested benefits for 
                      those of working age not in employment. This is followed 
                      by a discussion of growing inequality, of who is at greatest 
                      risk of poverty (families with dependent children, women, 
                      lone parents, and minority ethnic groups) and of the effects 
                      of income poverty (blighted lives and depleted opportunities). 
                      Globalisation and social change are explored and related 
                      to recent changes in the social security system, and in 
                      particular the movement towards a 'core' (income-tested)

                      to the greater importance of 'workfare' elements in the

                      in this book meaning 'income tested' (p.124)). Case management 
                      and an emphasis on paid work have now replaced a system 
                      containing important universal elements, and the author's 
                      verdict is that the new system entrenches poverty for large 
                      sections of the population, and particularly amongst the 
                      poorest families with children.</font></p>

                      tested pension system, as that remains an important contribution

                      of us, on this planet of abundance, are entitled to a fair 
                      share of society's surplus, to an extra income, not from 
                      what we earn from our labour and capital, but from what 
                      economists call 'rent' for land and resources and government-granted 
                      privileges. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                      ancient Athens, qualifying Greeks - free males - received 
                      a dividend from the proceeds of leasing a natural resource, 
                      the silver mines outside the city. Two thousand years later, 
                      citizens of Kuwait got a dividend from oil royalties. Residents 
                      of Alaska still do. And in the ski resort of Aspen Colorado, 
                      a majority of residents qualify for housing assistance funded 
                      from a tax on land. 'Owe' and 'own' were once variants of 
                      one meaning.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today 
                      we spend immense sums on the nature we use, including sites, 
                      resources, EM spectrum, and the ecosystem in general. Presently, 
                      however, we pay a handful of owners while we should be paying 
                      ourselves. None of us, by exerting any labour or capital, 
                      created valuable nature, and all of us as a society create 
                      its value. The value of location is generated not by what 
                      an owner has put on top of it but by natural surroundings, 
                      by one's neighbors, and by one's society's growth. Hence 
                      this value is ours to share.</font></p>

                      with the various forms of 'land' are government-granted 
                      privileges: patents and copyrights, licenses, utility franchises, 
                      standards waivers, and banking regulations (which amounts 
                      to the privatization of the power to create money). The 
                      recipient of such privileges can charge the public for their 
                      use, thus making a profit out of what belongs to us all.</font></p>

                      charge for the use of such public goods might make it possible 
                      to reduce or abolish taxes on homes, sales, and earned income. 
                      Most people, owning no oil field or housing estate, would 
                      be better off; and if there is money left over then a dividend, 
                      or Citizen's Income, could be paid.</font></p>

                      Luther King, citing nineteenth century reformer Henry George,

                      is, it would 'automatically increase as the total social 
                      income grows.' Technological and social progress continually

                      current finance-induced crisis has led to a belief that 
                      because the supply side caused it, the solution lies mainly 
                      in supply-side mechanisms. Banks must be bailed out and 
                      huge subsidies given to near-bankrupt firms with little 
                      long-term future. To take up labour market slack, public 
                      works are back in vogue, echoing Roosevelt's New Deal. To 
                      the extent that this will work, it will take several years 
                      to do so. Regrettably, it will not work very well. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 
                      are in danger of over-emphasising analogies with 1929. In 
                      some ways, the challenge is greater. Because globalisation 
                      has created a global market system, the risk is the first 
                      truly global depression. In the 1930s, the response to the 
                      financial hubris of the 1920s was tariff protectionism; 
                      in 1932 Keynes himself wrote an article opposing free trade. 
                      Now, we are in danger of diving into an era of subsidy protectionism.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Already 
                      we see signs of 'beggar-thy-neighbour' subsidy competition, 
                      as governments seek to prop up rust-belt or 'strategic' 
                      industries. Announcement of billions of dollars in subsidised 
                      loans to US car-makers has been swiftly followed by plans 
                      to help competing car firms in Europe and Asia. No sooner 
                      have the Dutch introduced a top-up wage subsidy for firms 
                      putting employees on short-time than UK union leaders are 
                      demanding the same as 'the best way forward'.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All 
                      such subsidy schemes are inefficient and distortionary. 
                      Worse, they are inequitable. Why should governments subsidise 
                      some median earners, with their pensions and healthcare 
                      benefits, but not others, who may be far more vulnerable, 
                      outside the selected industries? Moral and immoral hazards 
                      are plain. The money will go to those most successful at 
                      lobbying or at bringing people out on the streets to scare 
                      the politicians.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whatever 
                      the causes, the main risk we confront in 2009, and well 
                      beyond if we are not careful, is one of shrinking aggregate 
                      demand. Fear-induced cuts in investment and consumption 
                      could produce a lengthy depression induced by collapsing 
                      confidence. The animal spirits are chastened and panicky.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                      Keynesian-type response is attractive; it requires a globally 
                      coordinated stimulus, along with a restructuring of international 
                      financial agencies. But every crisis also offers an opportunity 
                      for innovative solutions. Economists and policymakers must 
                      think out of the box of history. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider 
                      today's economic system. As a result of economic liberalisation, 
                      and the privatisation and commercialisation of social policy 
                      as well as economic activity, there is systemic insecurity. 
                      We cannot respond to the crisis by rebuilding welfare states 
                      as they were constructed after the Great Depression.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At 
                      that time, rich societies were industrial economies, in 
                      which contingency risks could be overcome largely through 
                      contingency benefits, such as labour-based contributory 
                      unemployment benefits and sick leave. But such 'labourist' 
                      social security schemes do not work in open, flexible service-based 
                      societies. Even in rich OECD countries, only a minority 
                      of the unemployed would receive unemployment benefits. The 
                      rest would have little to fall back on. The precariat would 
                      be seething, easy prey for extremist politicians. That is 
                      already happening.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What 
                      is needed is an automatic economic stabiliser to moderate 
                      demand fluctuations and to reduce the systemic insecurity 
                      that has come with globalisation. My proposal is for every 
                      citizen to be provided with what might be called a <i>stabilisation 
                      grant</i>. This would be paid to every citizen, as a right, 
                      rather than a subsidy to a favoured few in a particular 
                      status or place.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By 
                      providing a measure of security to all citizens, whether 
                      or not in paid employment, the grant would encourage consumption 
                      and boost aggregate demand, aiding local businesses, products 
                      and services. It would also reduce fear, thereby fostering 
                      altruism, social solidarity and economic rationality rather 
                      than selfishness and xenophobia.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      idea of basic income has a long and distinguished pedigree 
                      but it is its potential role as an automatic stabiliser 
                      that makes it intriguingly relevant at this juncture. Keynes 
                      advocated something like it in <i>How to Pay for the War</i>. 
                      If there is systemic insecurity, selective schemes are inefficient 
                      and inequitable. If you bail out bankers or mortgage holders 
                      or inefficient dinosaur firms, you help groups that are 
                      not among the most needy. If you extend unemployment benefits, 
                      you assist those who had relatively well-paid jobs with 
                      good contributions records. The failings of the welfare 
                      system are compounded if eligibility for benefits is determined 
                      by means tests and/or futile job search requirements.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                      grant must be universal. Unlike in Keynes's time, it is 
                      now feasible to integrate tax-and-benefit systems, so a 
                      claw-back could ensure the beneficiaries would be lower-income 
                      citizens. The value of the monthly grant could be adjusted 
                      in real terms in accordance with the rate of economic growth 
                      and the depth of a recession. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                      systemic crisis calls for a systemic response. A modest 
                      stabilisation grant would boost purchasing power and consumption. 
                      It would be egalitarian and liberating - which is why several 
                      Nobel-winning economists have been drawn to the idea. Evidence 
                      from cash-transfer schemes around the world shows that they 
                      encourage rather than discourage people to take paid work 
                      where available. And there would be no need for a rise in 
                      the structural budget deficit, since sensible financing 
                      options are available, including the elimination of many 
                      existing wasteful and inequitable subsidies and benefits.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If 
                      governments could find the political will and courage to 
                      adopt such a solution, future generations would remember 
                      this global crisis as having ushered in a new era of economically 
                      secure citizenship. </font></p>
