                  <td width="100%" height="19788">

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
                      are two particularly interesting aspects to the debate surrounding 
                      the announcement at the Conservative Party Conference that 
                      Child Benefit is to be denied to any household in which 
                      someone is paying higher rate tax. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
                      is the argument accepted by so many commentators and Conservative 
                      Party members: that it is wrong for people on low earnings 
                      to be paying tax which is then paid in Child Benefit to 
                      high earners. What they seem not to have noticed is that: 
                      a) higher earners pay far more in tax than they receive 
                      in Child Benefit, so they already fund a higher proportion 
                      of the cost of Child Benefit than low earners do; and b) 
                      in order to deprive higher rate taxpayers of Child Benefit 
                      an entirely new and expensive administrative function will 
                      need to be established, thus wasting public funds. It is 
                      difficult to see why the Government made the announcement 
                      it did. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Why 
                      not instead raise the upper earnings limit on employees' 
                      National Insurance contributions? This could reduce the 
                      deficit by the same amount, and it would not add to administrative 
                      costs. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      second interesting aspect of the debate is that it offers 
                      evidence of massive public approval of universal benefits. 
                      Child Benefit is popular because it provides a secure income 
                      floor for families with children; over- and under-payments 
                      are almost unknown; administrative costs are very low; and, 
                      because everyone with children gets it, it contributes to 
                      social cohesion. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
                      the Government wants to reduce administrative waste and 
                      at the same time unite our society ( - and isn't a cohesive 
                      society a prerequisite of the Big Society?) then not only 
                      should it leave Child Benefit well alone, but it should 
                      also seek additional policies which will contribute to social 
                      cohesion, enable society as a whole to contribute to the 
                      costs of bringing up children, reduce inequality, and reduce 
                      administrative costs. To move from the proposed Universal 
                      Credit to a Citizen's Income would do all of this. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Could 
                      the Government ask for more?<br>

                      came too late for us to include the announcement in the 
                      printed version of this edition of the Citizen's Income 
                      Newsletter. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
                      is a pleasure to see that Steve Webb, Minister for Pensions 
                      at the Department for Work and Pensions, is proposing that 
                      the state pension should become a flat rate payment to every 
                      pensioner. This has been a Liberal Democrat proposal for 
                      some years and we now look forward to it becoming practical 
                      policy and to the benefits which Vince Cable and Steve Webb 
                      have promised and which we and the Pensions Policy Institute 
                      have always said will accrue. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under 
                      our present contributory and means-tested system, those 
                      who have taken time away from employment in order to care 
                      for children, or for elderly or disabled relatives, will 
                      often receive contributory pensions smaller than those paid 
                      to people who have remained in full-time employment; and, 
                      because means-tested top-ups take savings into account, 
                      they discourage saving for retirement.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      Citizen's Pension - an unconditional, nonwithdrawable flat-rate 
                      payment for every pensioner - will not be reduced by gaps 
                      in someone's employment record, nor by someone's savings. 
                      It will therefore not discriminate against carers and it 
                      will encourage people to save for their retirements. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      Citizen's Pension will also, of course, reduce considerably 
                      the administration required by state pensions. Contributory 
                      benefits are costly to administer, and means-tested benefits 
                      notoriously so. A Citizen's Pension will be as cheap to 
                      administer as Child Benefit currently is.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having 
                      recognised that universal flat-rate benefits have advantages 
                      which means-tested benefits do not, we hope that the Chancellor 
                      of the Exchequer will look again at his recent proposals 
                      relating to Child Benefit and decide to retain it as a universal, 
                      nonwithdrawable payment for every child. </font> </p>

                      of benefits and tax credits; and to improve work incentives, 
                      for example by removing the current 'very high' marginal

                      addition, to improve incentives to work (especially for

                      in their Universal Credit until they earned over a certain 
                      level and, in order to improve the incentive to earn more, 
                      the system might involve applying a single taper to reduce 
                      the Universal Credit where earnings (net of tax and national 
                      insurance) exceed the level of the earnings disregard in 
                      place of the current different withdrawal rates across out-of-work 
                      benefits, tax credits, housing benefit and council tax benefit. 
                      This taper could apply to all earnings, regardless of the

                      that different families need support for different reasons, 
                      the introduction of a Single Unified Taper would mean that 
                      once eligibility has been assessed, the system could work 
                      without earnings disregards and withdraw benefit entitlement

                      to be separate provision for extra costs, and tax credits

                      by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, this model would replace

                      housing benefit, council tax benefit and child benefit with 
                      an integrated 'family allowance' paid directly into bank

                      up to &pound;90 would have no impact, and earnings above 
                      this would be subject to a 30 per cent withdrawal rate (with 
                      an additional 15 per cent on the housing element). Tax allowances 
                      would be adjusted so that tax and NI would be payable once 
                      the earnings disregard had been exhausted.</font></p>

                      by the TaxPayers' Alliance, this reform would bring together 
                      a large number of existing benefits but, unlike other approaches 
                      that introduce a single benefit, it would involve the introduction 
                      of a negative income tax. This would replace current income-replacement 
                      benefits and tax credits, although a number of the current 
                      benefits aimed at supporting those with a limited ability 
                      to work or who need extra support would be retained.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under 
                      the model, a household's eligibility for the negative income 
                      tax would be based on their characteristics, and set equal 
                      to a given proportion of (equivalised) median income. As 
                      household income increased from individuals moving into 
                      work or progressing in work, the level of the negative income 
                      tax would be reduced in such a way that the Marginal Deduction 
                      Rate (inclusive of income tax, NI contributions and the 
                      withdrawal of the negative income tax) was constant until 
                      all support was exhausted. This implies that the system 
                      would not have a system of earnings disregards.</font></p>

                        reason for receiving benefit, thereby creating a 'single

                        the Netherlands and the United States - which might stimulate 
                        innovation and ensure that systems are more aligned to

                      begin our response with a question which the consultation

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Income 
                      tax, National Insurance contributions, Tax Credits and welfare 
                      benefits together provide the structure for income maintenance. 
                      Should all aspects of this structure be considered together 
                      during this consultation?</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      answer to that question surely has to be: 'Yes, if the Government's 
                      aims are to be met.' The entire system needs to encourage 
                      employment, save money, promote fairness, and provide sufficient 
                      resources for those who need them most. </font></p>

                      positive answer to our own question underlies our responses

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
                      believe that the objective of income maintenance reform 
                      in the longer term should be the implementation of a Citizen's 
                      Income: a universal, unconditional, non-withdrawable payment 
                      to each legal resident individually. This should replace 
                      most Tax Credits and means-tested benefits, but we recognize 
                      that payment of Housing and Council Tax Benefits would have 
                      to continue alongside the individualized Citizen's Income. 
                      The level of the Housing and Council Tax Benefits would 
                      be just sufficient to meet the different needs of claimants 
                      in single or multiple occupancy, with a cap varying geographically.</font></p>

                      therefore support the proposals in the Consultation Paper

                      steps should the Government consider to reduce the cost 
                      of the welfare system and reduce welfare dependency and 
                      poverty? </b></font></p>

                      three parts of this question have a connected answer: If 
                      we are to reduce welfare dependency then we need to increase 
                      incentives to seek employment, incentives to learn new skills 
                      in order to increase earnings, and incentives to establish 
                      small businesses. This requires that marginal deduction 
                      rates should be reduced (that is, that less of each additional 
                      pound earned should be withdrawn through taxation and through 
                      benefits withdrawal). Increased employment and self-employment 
                      incentives will lead to more employment and self-employment, 
                      and this will in turn reduce poverty. It will also reduce 
                      the numbers of people in receipt of means-tested benefits 
                      and this will reduce costs. </font></p>

                      is true that increasing incentives will, in some cases, 
                      cost additional resources. Also, every restructuring creates 
                      winners and losers. The Government will need to agree an 
                      acceptable maximum for household losses in the lower earnings 
                      deciles and will need to test proposed schemes against this 
                      acceptable level. Schemes will also need to be tested as 
                      to whether they save or cost money in the aggregate. It 
                      will be particularly useful to develop a simple mechanism 
                      for regulating the ongoing costs or savings of a new tax 
                      and benefits system ( - for instance, the National Insurance 
                      contribution upper earnings limit: a higher limit will result 
                      in reduced costs for the tax and benefits system as a whole).

                      combined with Income Tax rates, impose high marginal deduction 
                      rates of 85% on large numbers of household types across

                      benefits if employment ends after a few months, are significant 
                      disincentives. These are even more significant for the large

                      of the problem. It isn't part of the problem for the earnings 
                      range along the horizontal axis for the household type for 
                      which the graph has been drawn. (We're not told the household 
                      composition, nor what rent they are paying). At only slightly 
                      higher earnings the Child Tax Credit will be withdrawn as 
                      earnings rise, thus contributing to the high overall taper

                      employment can provide little financial gain for the household.

                      strategy will generally be too daunting to contemplate. 
                      Here the combination of no financial incentive and the unpredictable 
                      changes to benefits can create a substantial hurdle which 
                      the household is unlikely to wish to attempt to cross.</font></p>

                      who deduct Income Tax and National Insurance contributions, 
                      or to legitimate self-employment. Bill Jordan et al, in 
                      <i>Trapped in Poverty? Labour-market decisions in low-income 
                      households</i> (Routledge, 1992), has shown how low income 
                      households will seek or create employment opportunities 
                      in the informal economy, and will only enter the formal 
                      economy if the net change in income will be stable and significant. 
                      The system today is no less complex than it was in 1992, 
                      and is arguably more complex. </font></p>

                      factors work together to discourage legitimate employment 
                      and self-employment: 1. negligible net financial rewards; 
                      2. complexity and the resultant unpredictability of outcomes 
                      of changes in employment status; 3. the serious disruption 
                      to income maintenance strategies which households face as 
                      their members enter and leave employment; 4. the sheer hard 
                      work of making benefit and Tax Credit claims: always time-consuming, 
                      often frustrating, and with the resulting benefits too often 
                      miscalculated. If they are too low then additional deprivation 
                      is the result, and if too high then the repayments demanded 
                      can cause debt and hardship. Most people know someone who 
                      has suffered these problems, even if they haven't suffered 
                      them themselves, and the danger of Tax Credit overpayments 
                      are therefore a significant disincentive to taking employment.

                      in the current system. It is a problem because each component 
                      of the system requires frequent human intervention. If such 
                      interventions were not required, or were required in only

                      be removed from large parts of the system. Even greater 
                      administrative savings will be achieved by integrating the 
                      tax and benefits systems as far as possible. This would 
                      mean that duplication between the tax and benefits systems 
                      would no longer occur. The transition into and out of employment 
                      would no longer require information to be received, checked 
                      and recorded, for those benefits paid that were not related

                      costs, and would remove almost entirely the possibility 
                      of error, overpayment, and fraud (all of which are minimal 
                      for Child Benefit). Such a change would remove almost all 
                      need for customer service. (The reason we hear almost no 
                      complaints about Child Benefit customer service is that

                      the mismatch between earned incomes and housing costs in 
                      many parts of the country (especially London), a Housing 
                      Benefit system will still be required. However, the taper 
                      will need to be reduced if Housing Benefit is not to continue 
                      to be the disincentive to households increasing their earned 
                      income, as it is at present. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      Housing Benefit taper is a problem because so much of the 
                      current system is means-tested, creating a total taper of 
                      up to 95% for many households across wide earnings ranges. 
                      For the rest of the system to cease to be means-tested would 
                      mean that the Housing Benefit taper and the Income Tax rate 
                      would be the only tapers contributing to employment disincentives, 
                      so Housing Benefit would no longer be as much of a problem 
                      as it is now.</font></p>

                      market. The solutions lie elsewhere: in the building of 
                      more single-person homes, regulating the mortgage market 
                      to control house price inflation, applying Capital Gains

                      Income rises the number of people on means-tested benefits 
                      will fall (because increasing numbers will choose employment

                      a pleasure to see the new Government taking seriously the

                      by the Department for Work and Pensions rather than by the

                      Tax Credits in isolation from Income Tax and National Insurance 
                      contributions, the Government is in danger of missing an 
                      important opportunity for the radical change which our economy,

                      major reason for suggesting that tax and benefits need to 
                      be treated together is that only by considering Income Tax 
                      allowances and rates along with the structure of benefits 
                      and of Tax Credits can all of the available options for 
                      reform be considered. In particular, a Citizen's Income, 
                      which would deliver all of the Government's principles for 
                      reform (adjusted as suggested above), requires that Income 
                      Tax allowances be turned into cash payments as well as those 
                      parts of the Tax Credits and benefits systems becoming unconditional, 
                      non-withdrawable and individualised. In this way a Citizen's 
                      Income can be created and transitions into and out of employment 
                      can become seamless in relation to the tax and benefits 
                      structure. </font></p>

                      21st century really does need a new approach, and a genuinely 
                      reforming Government offers the necessary opportunity to 
                      consider the broadest possible range of reform options. 
                      Back in 1983 a House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service 
                      Committee Sub-Committee recommended that a Citizen's Income 
                      should be seriously considered as an option for reform, 
                      and in 1994 the Social Justice Commission came to the same 
                      conclusion. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Particularly 
                      important in the context of the fast-changing society and 
                      economy which we are bound to see during the twenty-first 
                      century will be a tax and benefits system which is as simple 
                      as possible and with as few rigidities as possible. If for 
                      no other reason, a Citizen's Income would be a serious candidate 
                      for the necessary reform. But as we have made clear in our 
                      responses to the questions contained in the consultation 
                      document, there are numerous reasons to consider a Citizen's 
                      Income as an important option for the basis of the tax and 
                      benefits system that we now need. </font></p>

                      credits would be an important step towards a Citizen's income.

                      Universal Credits; would offer additional advantages in 
                      terms of administrative efficiency, lower marginal deduction 
                      rates, the reduction of fraud, a more flexible labour market,

                      'The measures introduced in the June 2010 Budget are regressive

                      within the bottom nine income decile groups. The biggest 
                      losers from the June 2010 Budget are low income households

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN) has come of age. It held 
                      its fourteenth international congress in the Brazilian city 
                      of Sao Paulo on June 30-July 3, 2010, and was attended by 
                      over 400 participants from 31 countries, including representatives 
                      of the UK's Citizen's Income Trust, and was remarkable for 
                      the upbeat mood among the participants.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      primary reason for that was that Brazil's own bolsa familia 
                      scheme was working remarkably well. Members of BIEN had 
                      lobbied for a Brazilian cash transfer scheme in the 1990s, 
                      and after some years of scepticism this had helped lead 
                      to a series of experimental cash transfer schemes in Brazilian 
                      cities, known as <i>renda minima</i> and <i>bolsa escola</i> 
                      (school bags). When President Lula was elected in 2001 he 
                      consolidated several types of scheme in the <i>bolsa familia</i>, 
                      a cash transfer made conditional on families sending their 
                      children to school and to health clinics. By 2010, over 
                      50 million Brazilians were receiving the cash transfers, 
                      and, under a law passed in 2004, the Government has committed 
                      the country to introduce an unconditional basic income as 
                      and when it can afford to do so. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Symbolic 
                      of the commitment, President Lula held a 90-minute discussion 
                      with the Executive Committee of BIEN on the day before the 
                      Congress, and the man who as Minister of Social Welfare 
                      had been responsible for introducing and implementing the 
                      <i>bolsa familia</i>, Patrus Anaias, actively participated 
                      in the Congress, as did the Senator for Sao Paulo, Eduardo 
                      Suplicy, who is now co-president of BIEN.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      mood at the Congress was optimistic, partly because 17 Latin 
                      American countries now operate cash transfer schemes and 
                      seem to be moving towards a universalistic type of system. 
                      The challenge now is to roll back the focus on <i>conditionalities</i>. 
                      Evidence presented at the Congress showed that the main 
                      reason why the cash transfers have had such a positive effect 
                      on poverty, nutrition, child school performance, income 
                      distribution and women's socio-economic status, is the provision 
                      of cash, and not the application of costly and onerous conditions.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well 
                      over 100 technical papers were presented at the Congress. 
                      Among the most interesting was one on how the oil subsidy 
                      in Iran is being converted into a simple cash transfer, 
                      a form of basic income, without that being presented by 
                      the authorities as that. There was also news of pilot basic 
                      income schemes in Africa and India, exciting developments 
                      that are leading to important evaluation exercises that 
                      all advocates of universal basic income security should 
                      follow with interest. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
                      the end of the Congress, the Executive approved the new 
                      membership of the Basic Income Korean Network, the body 
                      representing activists and academics promoting basic income 
                      in South Korea. At the time of registering, the BIKN had 
                      444 paid up members and has been expanding rapidly. It joined 
                      the Japanese Basic Income Network that had held its inaugural 
                      conference in Kyoto in April, which drew hundreds of academics 
                      and activists from across Japan.</font></p>

                      editorial for the <i>Citizens Income Newsletter</i> 2010, 
                      issue 1, in praise of Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett's 
                      book <i>The Spirit Level</i>, argued that we need to 'go 
                      deeper into the causes of inequality than the authors have 
                      been able to.' In Malcolm Torry's substantial review of 
                      that book, carried in the same issue, he noted that <i>The 
                      Spirit Level</i> should serve as a 'call to action' and 
                      that it was 'full of proposals for action.'</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
                      begin with these points because, in many ways, they serve 
                      to frame the contribution made by geographer Daniel Dorling 
                      in his new book <i>Injustice: Why Social Inequality Persists</i>. 
                      The study of social inequality has been irreversibly altered 
                      by <i>The Spirit Level</i>, and in many ways Dorling's book 
                      should be read as a complement to Wilkinson and Pickett's. 
                      Yet it is, at heart, a fundamentally different sort of book. 
                      If, as Torry argued, <i>The Spirit Level</i> stands as a 
                      'call to action,' then Dorling's book stands alongside it 
                      as a 'call to contemplation.'</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Explaining 
                      the title of his book, Dorling writes that 'If you had to 
                      choose one word to characterise the nature of human society 
                      as it is currently arranged worldwide, there is no better 
                      word than 'injustice'' (p. 5). He proceeds to set out what 
                      he calls 'the five faces of social inequality.' These are, 
                      in turn, that 'elitism is efficient'; 'exclusion is necessary'; 
                      'prejudice is natural'; 'greed is good'; and 'despair is 
                      inevitable'. Dorling argues that each of these beliefs has 
                      now become naturalised amongst a large proportion of the 
                      populations in the wealthiest, most unequal countries in 
                      the world, foremost amongst which he places the USA and 
                      Great Britain.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following 
                      a short introduction and a subsequent chapter outlining 
                      the relationship between injustice and inequality, Dorling 
                      devotes lengthy chapters to each of his five faces of inequality. 
                      In turn, he exposes how elitism is bred through the structure 
                      of education in unequal societies, how social exclusion 
                      - normally targeting the poor and immigrants - has become 
                      the norm, how prejudice and a 'wider racism' are spreading 
                      thanks to inequality, and how the belief that 'greed is 
                      good' is leading to over-consumption and increasing waste 
                      within unequal societies. Backed up by detailed evidence, 
                      more of which can be found on the website accompanying the 
                      book, Dorling's arguments are - with the possible exception 
                      of his over-generalised use of the word 'racism' - persuasive.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dorling 
                      goes beyond the analysis offered in <i>The Spirit Level</i> 
                      by offering an exacting critique of the ideas which sustain 
                      unequal societies. His book offers a trenchant assault on 
                      the elitist ideas structuring society, departing from the 
                      scholarly prose of Wilkinson and Pickett to offer an analysis 
                      tinged with real passion and anger. At times, this means 
                      that Dorling's analysis can seem a little simplistic - it 
                      is frustrating, for example, that despite his attention 
                      to the importance of ideas, Dorling makes no attempt to 
                      engage with the wide variety of theoretical work on justice 
                      and injustice. Yet, in a sense, this is a result of Dorling's 
                      overall approach, which argues that grand theories and projects 
                      are of little interest, and that instead we should be focussing 
                      on the way in which everyday ideas about injustice permeate 
                      society, become normalised, and result in unjust outcomes 
                      for particular groups of people.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Relating 
                      to the question of a Citizen's Income, Dorling's book makes 
                      two important contributions. Firstly, he calls for a 'living 
                      wage' in all affluent countries, drawing on the work of 
                      the Basic Income Earth Network to advance his case (p. 154). 
                      There seems to be some confusion here, given that a living 
                      wage and a Basic (Citizen's) Income are two different things, 
                      but Dorling does, later, make an explicit, although somewhat 
                      brief and uninspiring, argument in favour of a Citizen's 
                      Income as a means for making life in affluent countries 
                      'less wasteful and more fulfilling' (p. 267). Whilst it 
                      is good to see a prominent academic arguing in favour of 
                      a Citizen's Income, it is a shame that Dorling's discussion 
                      of the pros and cons of the policy, as well as the undoubted 
                      difficulties which would stand in the way of its implementation, 
                      should be so short as to seem superficial. However, the 
                      second and perhaps more important point of relevance to 
                      the Citizen's Income cause is the argument for 'heterodox 
                      economics' which Dorling advances throughout the book. Drawing 
                      on exciting new economic thinking, such as Molly Scott Cato's 
                      <i>Green Economics</i>, Dorling makes the case for a steady-state 
                      economy - something for which <i>The Spirit Level</i> also 
                      argued. Throughout, Dorling engages productively with the 
                      idea that there might be limits to sustainable economic 
                      growth. It is this sort of economic thought - focused on 
                      people not profit - which can take us beyond the impasse 
                      reached by neoliberalism, and which might be a precursor 
                      to the establishment of a Citizen's Income.This reader disagrees 
                      with Dorling's prioritisation of ideas over and above political 
                      action, believing instead that a more intricate combination 
                      of the two is required. However, Dorling is surely correct 
                      to argue that ideas have material consequences, and as such 
                      his work needs to be taken up by those working to change 
                      both the ideas which structure society, and the very structures 
                      themselves. Certainly, at a time when David Cameron and 
                      Iain Duncan Smith, with Nick Clegg as their willing accomplice, 
                      are launching their assault on the welfare state, the challenge 
                      to conventional thinking offered by Dorling is more important 
                      than it has been for a generation. This book deserves a 
                      wide readership, and ought to be engaged with by anybody 
                      hoping to contest the ideas which underlie social injustice</font></p>

                      has written an 'educational novel' which he locates in the

                      Travels</i> and <i>Sophie's World</i>. The 'educational' 
                      intent is clearly signposted by the table at the beginning 
                      which tells the reader which social philosophy can be found

                      of the book. Fitzpatrick is clearly hoping that the book 
                      will help undergraduates to get to grips with the variety 
                      of social philosophies, which is what the book's dialogue

                      of <i>Voyage to Utopias</i> is a time travel story, whereas 
                      the dialogue is social philosophy, so we sometimes feel 
                      as if we're reading two books at once, the latter of which 
                      feels more like William Paul Young's <i>The Shack</i> than 
                      Bunyan's <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>. <i>The Shack</i> 
                      was a huge success, and I hope that Fitzpatrick's book will 
                      be too.</font></p>

                      is the fourth edition of an important textbook which for 
                      over thirty years has helped students of social policy to 
                      understand economic theory and the ways in which economic 
                      analysis contributes to social policy. Equally, it has helped 
                      students of economics to experience their discipline as 
                      a practical one which can inform social problems just as 
                      much as it can inform such economic problems as inflation 
                      and economic growth.<br>
                      This edition contains new chapters on pensions and on climate 
                      change, and all of the other chapters have been rewritten, 
                      but the basic approach of the book is as before: to understand 
                      social policy's aims as efficiency and equity; to ask whether 
                      in each social policy field the private market can achieve 
                      these aims; and to evaluate the effects on efficiency and 
                      equity of government intervention. 'Government failure' 
                      is now as much a part of the agenda as 'market failure'.<br>

                      particular interest to readers of this Newsletter will be 
                      the new chapter on pensions. Here, efficiency is understood 
                      in terms of income smoothing, and concepts such as the diminishing 
                      marginal utility of consumption discounting and expected 
                      benefit are explored. Equity as an aim generates a discussion 
                      of relative poverty and of different ways of measuring poverty. 
                      Equity requires government to intervene in order to provide 
                      sufficient income for those who cannot save enough during 
                      their working lives; and because a lack of information about 
                      investment options and their outcomes makes individual planning 
                      difficult, government also has to intervene in the cause 
                      of efficiency. The chapter compares different countries' 
                      systems and also the different instruments available to 
                      governments: means-testing, pay-as-you-go state pensions, 
                      funded 'social insurance', and the subsidy and regulation 
                      of private provision. The chapter might have benefited from 
                      discussion of the Pensions Policy Institute's work on a 
                      Citizen's Pension and in particular of the New Zealand example.<br>

                      justice, and equality. The market's unwillingness to insure 
                      where the insured possesses more information about risk 
                      than the insurer does means that government taxation, provision 
                      and regulation are essential, and the chapter closes with

                      to suggest reforms in the field under review; and it would 
                      be particularly interesting to see a treatment of unversalism

                      and education, and there are reasons why it works; Child 
                      Benefit works; and new expressions of universalism in practical 
                      policy could work too. It would be pleasure to find 'universalism',

                      of the Alaska Dividend</font></b></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
                      a time when progressive social policies are under attack 
                      across the industrialized world, the Alaska Dividend continues 
                      to be extremely popular. It distributes a yearly dividend 
                      to every man, woman, and child in Alaska without any conditions 
                      whatsoever. It has helped Alaska maintain one of the lowest 
                      poverty rates in the United States. It has helped Alaska 
                      become the most economically equal of all 50 states. And 
                      it has helped Alaska become the only U.S. state in which 
                      equality has risen rather than fallen over the last 20 years. 
                      Certainly Alaska is doing something right.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
                      newsletter editor for USBIG (United States Basic Income 
                      Guarantee), I've followed the Alaska Dividend for the past 
                      ten years. I am currently in the process of co-editing a 
                      book on the dividend entitled <i>Exporting the Alaska Model</i> 
                      (Palgrave-MacMillan, forthcoming). In the process, I've 
                      learned several lessons that I believe are valuable to people 
                      interested in progressive social policy and the basic income.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      first and simplest lesson is that resource dividends are 
                      popular once they're in place. I'll talk about this more 
                      as I go.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      second and most important lesson is that the Alaska model 
                      can be exported. You might be tempted to think that anything 
                      connected with the Alaskan oil industry is an aberration; 
                      something possible only because of Alaska's oil windfall. 
                      But you do not have to be resource rich to have a resource 
                      dividend. There are three reasons why I know this is true. 
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, 
                      Alaska isn't unusually rich. Oil has brought them from being 
                      one of the poorer states to being one of the wealthier states, 
                      but they are not the wealthiest state in the union. In fact, 
                      including the District of Columbia, Alaska ranks only tenth 
                      with a per capita GDP of about $42,000-only $2,500 higher 
                      than the national average. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Second, 
                      Alaska uses only a tiny fraction of its resource wealth 
                      to fund the entire dividend. Alaska has many valuable natural 
                      resources including forestry, fisheries, gold, land value, 
                      and so on. Only taxes on oil pay into the dividend. The 
                      taxes on oil drilling in Alaska are low by international 
                      standards. And, only one-fourth of the taxes on Alaska's 
                      oil go into the fund that supports the dividend. Alaska 
                      used most of its oil windfall to give itself an enormous 
                      income tax cut. It went from having one of the highest state 
                      income tax rates in the United States to having no income 
                      taxes at all. And it funded the dividend from what was left 
                      over. If Alaska actually used its resources to support the 
                      dividend, there is no telling how high it would be. Leaving 
                      income taxes as they were and devoting all of the oil taxes 
                      to the fund would have made the dividend at least four times 
                      what it is now. Raising oil taxes and treating other resources 
                      the way Alaska treats oil would make it higher still.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Third, 
                      every country, state, and region has resources. Gary Flomenhoft 
                      estimates that Vermont (a state not known for resource wealth) 
                      could support a dividend larger than Alaska's, if it made 
                      judicious use of resource taxes. The most resource-poor 
                      countries in the world are probably Hong Kong and Singapore, 
                      where millions of people are crowded together on a little 
                      island, and they have to import almost everything they consume. 
                      But these countries have fabulously valuable real estate. 
                      I wouldn't be surprised if a tax on Singapore's land could 
                      support something much larger than the Alaska Dividend.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All 
                      of this shows that Alaskans don't have the dividend because 
                      they are resource-rich; they have it because they took advantage 
                      of the opportunity. This is the third lesson: look for opportunities. 
                      Again, the Alaskan experience is no aberration. Common resources 
                      are being privatized all the time all over the planet. Every 
                      new well that's drilled is an opportunity to assert community 
                      control of resources. So is every new mine that's dug and 
                      every new reserve that's discovered. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Many 
                      other opportunities are less obvious. Recently, the United 
                      States government gave away the digital broadcast spectrum 
                      to television companies. If they had auctioned off leases 
                      to the highest bidder, they would have raised billions of 
                      dollars per year. The need to do something about global 
                      warming is another opportunity. Two strategies currently 
                      being discussed, &quot;tax and dividend&quot; and &quot;cap 
                      and dividend&quot; would make polluters pay for the damage 
                      they do to the environment and return the proceeds to everyone.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 
                      course, there is a danger in selling off resources and using 
                      the proceeds for the public benefit. People might then want 
                      to sell more resources to make more money. Once corporations 
                      have bought off the people, perhaps they can get away with 
                      doing even more damage to the environment. The solution 
                      to this problem is the fourth lesson: think like a monopolist. 
                      That is, once we assert community control of resources, 
                      members of the community need to remember that, as a group, 
                      they have a monopoly over those resources. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Monopolists 
                      maximize revenue, not by selling all they can at bargain 
                      prices, but by restricting supply, selling less at higher 
                      prices. One monopolist that we should take as a model is 
                      Johnny Carson. In the 1970s, he found himself to be the 
                      most popular entertainer on American television. He demanded 
                      and got a record high salary, but he didn't stop there. 
                      He had his workload reduced from five to four days per week, 
                      and his vacation time increased to something like three 
                      months per year. He realized that his time was not only 
                      valuable when he sold it, but also when left unsold. Our 
                      resources and our environment are valuable not only as items 
                      for potential sale; they are valuable just as they are. 
                      As community owners of our environment, thinking like the 
                      stockholders of a monopoly, we could have more money coming 
                      in at the same time that we also have larger parks, larger 
                      nature reserves, less pollution, and better resource management.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
                      for the danger that a dividend will buy off individuals' 
                      environmental diligence, remember that polluters have been 
                      doing a job on our environment for thousands of years without 
                      buying off the people they harm. Nobody got a dividend when 
                      the Stone Age Maori hunted the New Zealand moa to extinction. 
                      Nobody got a dividend over the hundreds of years it took 
                      the fishing industry to slowly destroy the cod fisheries 
                      on the Grand Banks. Nobody gets a dividend for the arsenic 
                      in our water or the sulphur dioxide in our air.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      assertion of the community's right to demand compensation 
                      for individual or corporate exploitation of our environment 
                      can actually be an important part of the solution to our 
                      environmental problems. The right to compensation is part 
                      of the right of ownership, and along with ownership comes 
                      the right to manage, regulate, and restrict access. Receiving 
                      payment for resources helps the members of the community 
                      to think of themselves as joint owners of the environment 
                      with the power to command that tenants be good stewards 
                      of the environment. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                      feeling of shared ownership is one of the reasons why resource 
                      dividends tend to be so popular once they're in place, leading 
                      me to the fifth lesson: build a large constituency. One 
                      way to build a constituency is through universal rather 
                      than targeted policies. Economically and philosophically 
                      speaking, I am indifferent between programs for all people 
                      and programs for all of the poor. As long as we permanently, 
                      unconditionally, eliminate poverty, I don't care whether 
                      we do it through a targeted negative income tax or a universal 
                      basic income or any other system. But politically speaking, 
                      my observations have taught me that we are much more likely 
                      to eliminate poverty with universal programs, because universal 
                      programs build a large constituency that will protect the 
                      program from political attack. It is easy for politicians 
                      to single out the recipients of target programs, because 
                      they are relatively weak and small.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
                      way to build a constituency is to be significant. Insignificant 
                      gimmicky programmes might be easier to pass, but they are 
                      also easier to cut when a different administration comes 
                      into power. If a politician proposed cutting the Alaska 
                      dividend, every Alaskan would face losing $1,000 a year 
                      or more for the rest of their lives. Whether that politician 
                      was promising a tax cut or some other spending program, 
                      they would put a universal constituency of Alaskans in the 
                      position where they would sacrifice something very significant 
                      for the uncertainty about whether the replacement will be 
                      delivered. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      British Labour Party recently failed to build a sufficient 
                      constituency to defend its Child Trust Fund. This program 
                      was intended to be universal. It was designed to ensure 
                      <i>eventually</i> that every native born British citizen 
                      would own something. But the government decided to phase 
                      in universality by granting a small 'baby bond' only to 
                      children born in or after 2002. Each child would receive 
                      a bond of &pound;250 at birth and another of &pound;250 
                      at age 7. This investment would provide enough for a one-time 
                      dividend of perhaps &pound;2000 at age 18-hardly a life-changing 
                      amount.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
                      the new Conservative-Liberal-Democratic coalition government 
                      came into power, the Child Trust Fund was one of the first 
                      programmes they announced that they would eliminate. The 
                      only people directly harmed by the cuts are babies born 
                      after 2010. The loss will only be a small one-time dividend, 
                      and they won't feel the loss in their wallets or be able 
                      to vote on it until 2028. It is not surprising that no significant 
                      opposition developed to the new government's plan to scrap 
                      the Child Trust Fund. The previous government did not create 
                      a program that was significant enough to a significant number 
                      of voters to make it worth defending.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      companion to building a large or universal constituency 
                      in favour of a programme is the sixth lesson: Avoid creating 
                      an opposition. Policies, such as the minimum wage and rent 
                      control, put most of the burden on one, specific, easily 
                      identifiable group who will probably fight the programme 
                      as long as it exists. Even programmes financed by broad-based 
                      income tax can create an opposition if people connect the 
                      burden of paying taxes with programmes they see themselves 
                      as unlikely to need. But the Alaska Dividend has virtually 
                      no opposition. No one has reason to feel burdened by its 
                      creation and continued existence. The yearly dividends are 
                      financed by the returns on state-owned investments. They 
                      don't cut into anyone's perceived ownership. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of 
                      course the Alaska fund is created and continually enlarged 
                      by taxes (or &quot;royalties&quot;) on oil drilling. But 
                      the oil companies aren't complaining. It was part of the 
                      deal they made to obtain the right to drill. Complaining 
                      about that now would be like complaining that they have 
                      to pay a price for the steel from their suppliers. It doesn't 
                      make sense to complain about what is obviously an unavoidable 
                      cost of doing business. The state owns the oil fields. Anyone 
                      who wants to drill must pay. That's just the way of the 
                      world. But notice how atypical that model is. Usually the 
                      state awards ownership of resources to corporations for 
                      free. Anyone who wants to use those resources must pay the 
                      corporations. And that's just the way of the world. Policies 
                      like the Alaska Dividend remind us that it's possible to 
                      change the way of the world.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
                      are times when corporations will fall all over each other 
                      to pay taxes. &quot;Medical&quot; marijuana producers in 
                      California are asking to be taxed so that they can be seen 
                      as legitimate businesses. Returning to the broadcast spectrum 
                      example, had the government sold it (instead of giving it 
                      away), they would have found many willing customers. Trying 
                      to impose those taxes now is more likely to create an opposition, 
                      but once we firmly establish the idea that taxes and regulations 
                      reflect community ownership and custodianship of the environment, 
                      there is little for an opposition to build around.</font></p>

                      Alaska dividend is not as large as it should be, but it 
                      has significant progressive effects, it works, and it's 
                      popular. Perhaps it's time to recognize it as a model we 
                      can build on.</font></p>
