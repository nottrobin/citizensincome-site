                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By 
                      the time you read this <i>Newsletter</i> the Government's 
                      consultation period on the future of the state pension will 
                      have ended and we shall be awaiting the outcome. In our 
                      submission (reprinted below) we commented on the second 
                      option for reform floated in the consultation paper: a single-tier 
                      flat rate pension based on the pensioner's contribution 
                      record. We wrote:</font></p>
                    <blockquote> 
                      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                        second option without a contribution record condition 
                        would meet the principles of simplicity and personal responsibility. 
                        It would be fair in the sense that every individual would 
                        be treated in the same way. Those few people who might 
                        be thought not to have contributed to society would in 
                        any case be receiving a means-tested pension under the 
                        current system, so there would be little if any additional 
                        cost to including them in a new single tier State pension.</font></p>

                      benefit: unconditional, nonwithdrawable, and a right of 
                      citizenship. We would welcome discussion on how the debate 
                      on the future of the health service and the debate on the 
                      future of the tax and benefits system might inform each

                      the basic State Pension is a flat-rate payment worth &pound;97.65 
                      a week and the State Second Pension is partly flat rate 
                      and partly linked to earnings, such that higher earners

                      would became flat rate by 2020 instead of the early 2030's. 
                      This would give people a clearer idea of the state pension 
                      they would get in retirement as they would receive a set 
                      amount of pension for each qualifying year. At the end of 
                      transition, all those with a full contribution record, for 
                      example 30 qualifying years, would build up the same state 
                      pension, currently estimated at around &pound;140 a week,

                      rules of entitlement between the basic State Pension and 
                      State Second Pension, and using the same uprating for the

                      on net income during retirement. However, they would not 
                      by themselves reduce complexity, and thus would not encourage 
                      personal responsibility or promote greater fairness. They

                      new pension scheme has to be cost neutral and cannot therefore 
                      include all existing pensioners from the start, so that 
                      a contribution-based, means-tested system will have to continue

                      this could extend many decades into the future. We propose 
                      that at the inception of the new pension structure every 
                      legal resident over 100 should immediately be eligible and 
                      that existing pensioners should become eligible on reaching 
                      the age of 100. This would mean that two parallel pension

                      advance towards a Citizen's Pension paid at the same rate 
                      to all legal residents of a qualifying age, and it is welcome 
                      that lesser amounts are no longer paid to couples than to 
                      two single people. However, it still depends on National 
                      Insurance contributions having been paid or credited for 
                      a minimum of 30 years. It is appropriate that this should 
                      be one way of establishing legal residence and that those 
                      who have worked in this country illegally and have not paid 
                      income tax or NI contributions should be excluded from entitlement 
                      to the State Pension, but other evidence of legal residence, 
                      such as inclusion in the electoral register, should be considered 
                      when determining eligibility.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Those 
                      most likely to be excluded are married women who have not 
                      worked, been unemployed or disabled, or had caring responsibilities 
                      for long enough and who currently rely on receiving Category 
                      B pensions based on their husbands' contributions. There 
                      will also need to be regulations for legal immigrants from 
                      other countries who have not been in the UK as long as 30 
                      years. If the UK has a reciprocal arrangement with their 
                      country of origin then they should be paid the new pension 
                      in full. If not, they should be paid pro rata and be expected 
                      to enhance that by claiming the pension to which they became 
                      entitled before leaving their country of origin.</font></p>

                      People should be able to defer the single tier pension and 
                      receive it later at a higher rate, as they can now for the 
                      basic state pension. If a Citizen's Pension were to be implemented, 
                      then the same could apply. If a Citizen's Income for all 
                      adults were to be implemented then such provision would 
                      no longer be appropriate or required. </font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Is 
                      it a cloak for revitalised Thatcherism or a genuine transfer 
                      of power to the people? Wrong question; the Big Society 
                      is the domestic counterpart and complement to the coalition 
                      government's attempt to maintain the UK's position in global 
                      capitalism. In this article, I shall argue that advocates 
                      of CI should address the strategy adopted by this government 
                      as a dual one, which distinguishes between those parts of 
                      the economy that trade in global markets, and those (in 
                      which most citizens get their work and income) that do not. 
                      The Big Society is a plan to transform the latter, which 
                      might be enabled by CI; but this would have to be funded 
                      mainly from the activities of the former.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      Big Society was conceived as a response to New Labour's 
                      programme for a top-down transformation of UK economy and 
                      society, according to a blueprint derived from the theory 
                      of information, incentives, and contracts (Jordan, 2010). 
                      Every institution, from the Bank of England and the Financial 
                      Services Authority to the regional government agencies, 
                      the strategic partnerships and the public services, was 
                      redesigned on this model (favoured by the World Bank), with 
                      detailed prescriptions for policy, inspection, management 
                      and practice. It was a rational, abstract, elitist project, 
                      in the Fabian tradition, which paid scant attention to the 
                      cultures or traditions of communities or even professions. 
                      It relied on compliance and checklists, not loyalty, solidarity 
                      or commitments; it undermined civil society and the basis 
                      in active engagement of democratic politics.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      Conservative response, first expressed in speeches by David 
                      Cameron, emphasised the need to revive collective life, 
                      associations and communities, and the significance of research 
                      on well-being. He insisted that relationships were, along 
                      with health and job satisfaction, the most important constituents 
                      of individual happiness. His themes included the weakening 
                      in family and neighbourhood bonds, and the evils of excessive 
                      individualism (Cameron, 2009, 2010).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So 
                      the Big Society idea evolved as an attack on those features 
                      of the New Labour programme which were most obviously derived 
                      from Thatcherism. These included the idea that citizenship 
                      was a contract between the state and the individual requiring 
                      the latter to be an independent, self-reliant, property-owning, 
                      credit-card carrier who turned to the banks, not to neighbours 
                      or a wider community, for all his or her needs (DSS, 1998, 
                      p. 80). </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
                      the other main theme of the Conservative strategy was 'Broken 
                      Britain' - the claim that part of the population had become 
                      structurally detached from the mainstream, and lacked the 
                      opportunities, links and incentives to rejoin it. Here the 
                      Conservatives relied mainly on the work of the Centre for 
                      Social Justice, whose lengthy reports under that title (CSJ, 
                      2006) documented the social problems concentrated in districts 
                      with the highest levels of deprivation. The Broken Britain 
                      theme found its way into the party manifesto of May, 2010, 
                      alongside the Big Society one (Conservative Party, 2010, 
                      pp27, 37).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
                      surprised many commentators that these ideas played such 
                      a large part in that campaign; they did not go down particularly 
                      well with voters. But in retrospect, it now seems clear 
                      that this was a necessary balance to the inevitable fiscal 
                      austerity which was to follow from a victory at the polls. 
                      In government, the Conservatives were to need some positive 
                      proposals to offset the savage cuts in public spending, 
                      and a new version of that part of the economy which had, 
                      especially in peripheral, less dynamic regions, come to 
                      rely on New Labour's multiplicity of state agencies and 
                      initiatives. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      first priority of the coalition was clearly to reassure 
                      the bond markets of its earnest intention to bring down 
                      the government deficit, and thus to avoid the fate of Iceland, 
                      Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Keeping the bondholder wolf 
                      from the door meant guaranteeing the profitability of the 
                      City, ensuring that the one 'world class' sector in the 
                      UK would continue to thrive during the uphill struggle to 
                      'rebalance' the economy by boosting manufacturing industry. 
                      George Osborne became the finance-friendly face of the government, 
                      concerned with the globally-traded part of UK plc; Cameron, 
                      Maude, Letwin and others were left to preach the Big Society 
                      gospel to those whose real incomes were declining as they 
                      faced higher taxes and higher prices. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                      was the background to the welfare reform package presented 
                      to Parliament in November 2010 by Iain Duncan Smith, so 
                      comprehensively analysed by Annie Miller in January's <i>CI 
                      Newsletter</i>. This was a watered-down version of the CSJ's 
                      scheme for partial tax-benefit integration, <i>Dynamic Benefits: 
                      Towards Welfare that Works</i> (2009); that set of proposals 
                      relied on improved incentives for marriage, saving and employment. 
                      The eventual legislation embodied benefits cuts and an increase 
                      in conditionality and coercion, against a background of 
                      rising unemployment. What price progress towards CI in this 
                      kind of Big Society?</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      element of the CSJ proposal which was retained in the modified 
                      reform was the integration of the tax-benefits system at 
                      the lowest level of earnings. Because the diagnosis of Broken 
                      Britain put heavy emphasis on the interactions between benefits 
                      withdrawal and the impact of income tax at these levels 
                      as barriers to labour-market participation, this feature 
                      survived. The effect will be to allow a higher disregard 
                      of earnings for those doing a few hours of paid work, and 
                      an even rate of deductions from pay packets for employment 
                      up to 16 hours a week. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                      was a step in the direction proposed by Hermione Parker 
                      in her 1989 book <i>Instead of the Dole</i>. Even though 
                      the reformed system retains the household basis of eligibility 
                      assessment, and is strongly reinforced by medical tests 
                      on claimants of incapacity benefit and programmes for pushing 
                      unemployed people into whatever work or training is available, 
                      it is difficult to see how a move in the direction of CI 
                      could be started without this shift. Together with the plans 
                      for consolidating state retirement benefits into universal, 
                      equal citizens' pensions for all, the implication is that 
                      National Insurance principles are being set aside in favour 
                      of a new form of income guarantee. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      question is whether the Big Society in turn points towards 
                      a change in economic and social relations which is compatible 
                      with a gradually less conditional implementation of the 
                      scheme - with steps, for instance, via the 'participation 
                      income' approach anticipated by Atkinson (1995) towards 
                      a CI. Will the new network of co-operatives, mutuals and 
                      social enterprises envisaged by its architects rely on Serco 
                      and other outsourcing company conscripts for its workforce? 
                      Will the active citizens who participate in neighbourhood 
                      schemes for conservation and social care be volunteers, 
                      or claimants on 'work readiness' programmes? And will the 
                      cure for Broken Britain actually involve the creation of 
                      whole districts whose austere economies and communal social 
                      forms exist in parallel with more glittering cosmopolitan 
                      ones that share in global prosperity?</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Obviously 
                      there can be no definitive answers to these questions, and 
                      the outcome will depend on the balance of political forces 
                      in the coalition. Critics of the whole Big Society concept 
                      insist that it can never become a viable model of how a 
                      modern industrial state is organised. But CI advocates must 
                      also ask ourselves which other feasible scenario of the 
                      future might now be expected to deliver the vision of an 
                      unconditional subsistence income for every citizen.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 
                      the past 40 years, the case for CI has primarily been framed 
                      in terms of a progressive political project, in which the 
                      scheme would supply the basis for equality, freedom and 
                      security within an overall context of social justice. The 
                      best known texts in justification of the principle, such 
                      as James Meade's <i>Agathotopia</i> (1988) and Philippe 
                      Van Parijs' <i>Real Freedom for All </i>(1995) relied on 
                      allegory or counterfactual fancy to construct imaginary 
                      societies, in which CIs for all allowed relationships of 
                      moral rectitude. The assumption behind their analyses was 
                      that benevolent political processes would enable a rational 
                      (if not consensual) progress towards a more harmonious social 
                      order.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
                      there seems little likelihood of such a pathway, because 
                      global capitalist development has cast the most advanced 
                      economies as centres of finance, research and technological 
                      innovation which require but few highly-specialised workers, 
                      and leave the majority of their populations to supply services 
                      for each other and themselves. The question becomes one 
                      of how the prosperous, mobile minority who are plugged into 
                      the global marketplace can be persuaded to fund the activities 
                      of a majority who are not. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some, 
                      like the German theorist Dirk Sloterdijk (2009), think that 
                      they can be flattered into a new form of nineteenth century 
                      philanthropy; the super-rich might be honoured with various 
                      kinds of charitable institution bearing their names. But 
                      the leading intellectual behind the whole Big Society project, 
                      Phillip Blond (2010), argues for a government-led programme 
                      for redistributing property and assets (such as the taxpayers' 
                      stake in the nationalised banks, along with other corporate 
                      and state resources) that would allow enterprises and income 
                      streams to be generated at the local level.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                      this, Blond harks back not only to the Toryism of Cobbett, 
                      Carlyle and Disraeli, but also to the Liberal Distributism 
                      of Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton. In the first decades 
                      of the twentieth century, they campaigned against Lloyd 
                      George's embryonic National Insurance scheme; Belloc's <i>The 
                      Servile State</i> (1912) was a polemical attack on the principle 
                      of making income security conditional on citizens' willingness 
                      to offer their labour power to commercial and manufacturing 
                      employers. In this context, Blond refers approvingly to 
                      Samuel Brittan's (1995) scheme for CI, although he does 
                      not develop the point (Blond, 2010, p. 32).</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So 
                      Blond's version of the project involves a political balancing 
                      act between policies which allow the internationally competitive 
                      parts of the economy to thrive, while sustaining local banks, 
                      building societies, shops, co-operatives, mutual societies 
                      and a wide range of community groups and social enterprises. 
                      At the same time, the public services would be devolved 
                      to staff co-operatives and service user groups, with accountability 
                      to an engaged community of active citizens.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All 
                      this implies that the battle lines are being drawn up between 
                      those who still adhere to the Third Way project - the state 
                      as rational central designer of a public infrastructure 
                      which functions like a machine, running on the rational 
                      self-interest of individual citizens and the inducements, 
                      penalties and nudges of the official order - and those who 
                      subscribe to a more organic set of patterns, 'uneven and 
                      lumpy', as Francis Maude (2011) has described it, responding 
                      to local conditions and creating particular niches, homespun 
                      and idiosyncratic rather than standardised and streamlined, 
                      and running on collective action. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Advocates 
                      of CI have perhaps unconsciously associated the idea with 
                      the former type of project, more Sweden than Spain or Italy. 
                      But globalisation itself, as much as the Big Society programme, 
                      challenges the assumptions on which this bias has been founded. 
                      There has, after all, been little evidence that social democrats 
                      incline towards the CI principle, and the rejection of state-led 
                      programmes all over Europe, even during an economic crisis, 
                      should give us pause. Now Ed Miliband is rethinking Labour's 
                      strategy in the face of working-class disillusion; Blond's 
                      Red Tory message is being answered by the Blue Labour communitarianism 
                      of Maurice (now Lord) Glasman and Marc Stears (BBC Radio 
                      4, 2011). Maybe we should keep an open mind about the Big 
                      Society. </font></p>

                      the 9th March the Financial Times reported that <b>Hong 
                      Kong</b> has paid HK$6,000 (about &pound;470) to every resident. 
                      The recent Hong Kong budget has led to local anger that 
                      the Government's large surplus has not been spent on better 
                      public services or on cleaning up Hong Kong's pollution. 
                      The article, which can be found at <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2731d5f0-4a87-11e0-82ab-00144feab49a.html#axzz1G6BE9mSn">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2731d5f0-4a87-11e0-82ab-00144feab49a.html#axzz1G6BE9mSn</a>, 
                      suggests that in a fiscal context experienced as inequitable, 
                      undemocratic, and unjust, a small Citizen's Income might 
                      be caught up in feelings generated by the wider context. 
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
                      its Spring conference, the<b> Green Party</b> reaffirmed 
                      its commitment to a Citizen's Income. Alex Ramsay writes: 
                      'Citizens' Income is a proposed system where benefits would 
                      be paid as one lump sum to every citizen, and then taxed 
                      back progressively from people as they earn - ensuring that 
                      no one lived in cash poverty. The motion was supported by 
                      Clive Lord and &#133; Alex Wood, and effectively opposed 
                      by Caroline Lucas MP and Darren Johnson AM. Despite two 
                      prominent opponents arguing that the policy is currently 
                      unaffordable, Alex won the day, by arguing for higher taxes 
                      on the wealthiest. For me, you can tell a party is truly 
                      democratic when its most prominent members can be defeated 
                      by those using the quality of their argument alone.'

                      Boyle</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                      an article in the last CI Newsletter we reproduced the first 
                      part of a review by Johannes Richardt of a best-selling 
                      pro-Basic Income book in German <i>1.000 Euro f&uuml;r Jeden: 
                      Freiheit. Gleichheit. Grundeinkommen</i>, by G&ouml;tz W 
                      Werner and Adrienne Goehler. That was a purely factual review 
                      of the book's contents. Richardt then went on to rubbish 
                      the idea, and the whole notion of Basic Income. The following 
                      are some of the points he makes: (I cannot help adding a 
                      few comments of my own.)</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His 
                      ideal is an '... emancipatory social state that would not 
                      rely on government intervention into the private lives of 
                      its citizens. It would take people seriously as autonomous 
                      citizens and provide material security only for the needy. 
                      It would provide the best medical care, quality education 
                      and child care available for those who call on it. And it 
                      would provide cheap energy, excellent infrastructure and 
                      investment in science and research.' </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Basic 
                      Income by contrast exhibits the 'abandonment of any aspiration 
                      toward full employment' (where having a job, presumably, 
                      represents for Richardt the highest emancipatory role of 
                      the autonomous citizen?) More jobs are needed because 'humans 
                      have consistently developed new needs that in turn have 
                      demanded rising levels of production.' (To equate human 
                      needs with a requirement for more (undifferentiated) production 
                      in the form of greater GDP is to fall into the economists' 
                      trap. It also ignores the<i> real </i>human needs described 
                      by Maslow and others.)</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 
                      a different tack, BI is criticised as a worse form of dependency: 
                      'Basic income undermines previous notions of welfare, which 
                      assert that only the needy get help from society.... Autonomous 
                      adult subjects are uniformly transformed into vulnerable 
                      objects of state assistance.' (No differentiation here between 
                      a help-up and a hand-out; the massive supports given to 
                      farmers and bankers do not seem to turn them into 'vulnerable 
                      objects'!) </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
                      it won't work anyway, he claims: '&euro;1,000 a month is 
                      not very much. ... basic income is only a higher form of 
                      poverty.' (This is simply wrong. 'Happiness' studies in 
                      countries around the world have shown that when GDP per 
                      person reaches this level, subject well-being is <i>maximised</i>.)</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
                      is all glorious nostalgia! Perhaps Richardt dreams of a 
                      better, nicer version of the DDR (the ex-East German Communist 
                      state) so delightfully parodied in the film 'GoodBye Lenin'. 
                      Such yearning for a better yesterday explains why BI is 
                      such a dangerous concept to Richardt and other Marxists. 
                      The danger is that BI really works and would create a better 
                      life in the future for everyone in a post-industrial age!</font></p>

                      Green Economics</i> is not, as its author readily admits, 
                      a monograph based entirely on new research or empirical 
                      evidence, though it has that too. Instead, what Cato offers 
                      is a summary of how Green economics as a field has developed 
                      historically, and what it offers which other approaches 
                      to economics often fail to take account of.</font></p>

                      book opens with a short introduction in which Cato sketches 
                      the key tenets of green economics. These include a desire 
                      to expand what we understand as being the economic sphere; 
                      a deep concern with social justice and equality; and a concern 
                      to alter the ways in which economic relationships shape 
                      our relationship to the environment. More generally, this 
                      section also sees Cato advance her most succinct definition 
                      of how green economics differs from conventional capitalist 
                      economics:</font></p>

                      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
                        the capitalist ideology it does not matter that economic 
                        growth is destructive and does not increase human well-being; 
                        it only matters that there is more money changing hands 
                        in the global market. There is too much emphasis on standard 
                        of living, usually measured in purely material terms, 
                        and not enough on quality of life. For green economists 
                        growth is the major problem, not only because it is usually 
                        bought at the expense of the planet, but also because 
                        it is actually reducing our quality of life (p. 9).</font></p>

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      book itself is structured in 3 parts. The first sketches 
                      the contours of green economic theory. Here, Cato fulfils 
                      the valuable function of drawing together a diverse range 
                      of work by a wide range of contemporary green economists, 
                      including Mary Mellor, Derek Wall, James Robertson, Richard 
                      Douthwaite and others. She also links this body of contemporary 
                      work to both longer historical tendencies and wider, non-European 
                      strains of thought. In part 2, Cato outlines a green economic 
                      'vision for the future,' discussing important areas such 
                      as work, money and business. Part 3, the longest and most 
                      detailed section of the book, details a number of policies 
                      for a green economy, and sets them within the wider context 
                      of the policy environment as it presently stands.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cato 
                      offers a number of excellent ideas, including discussions 
                      of the democratization of the money system, co-production 
                      as an economic strategy, and the broader idea of a 'convivial 
                      economy,' in which economic forces are structured around 
                      human needs, rather than the other way around. Such ideas 
                      press towards a justification of her argument that 'for 
                      the majority of green economists, a sustainable economy 
                      will not be a capitalist economy' (p 106). Within this vision 
                      for an economic future, Cato gives central prominence to 
                      the idea of a Citizen's Income. During a chapter on 'Green 
                      welfare,' as well as during other stages in the text, Cato 
                      sets out the crucial role which a Citizen's Income might 
                      play in a green economy, and in doing so illustrates perfectly 
                      how green economics involves altering conventional social 
                      relations as well as our engagement with the environment.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cato 
                      argues that a Citizen's Income is important because of its 
                      status as a universal benefit, payable to all. This she 
                      supports as an effort to move away from the intrusive, means-tested 
                      benefit system we currently have which both undermines 'a 
                      green commitment to autonomy,' and creates social divisons 
                      by 'sowing discord between those who are and are not eligible'. 
                      Cato argues that a Citizen's Income might be funded in part 
                      through a new system of taxation which would include the 
                      taxation of 'common resources,' most importantly of land.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cato 
                      has provided an excellent synthesis of a broad range of 
                      work and succeeds in establishing in outline what a green 
                      economy might look like, and what steps might need to be 
                      taken in order to move in this direction. That said, the 
                      book also suffers from some problems which are also associated 
                      with the broader field of green economics. For one, it sometimes 
                      feels that there is an over-fetishisation of 'the local,' 
                      in that this occasionally seems to be put forward as the 
                      panacea for all our economic ills in contrast to the inequities 
                      of globalization. Yet this formulation relies on a false 
                      division between the local and the global, and also ignores 
                      the fact that there is nothing inherent within them that 
                      stops locally-based economies being just as uneven and unequal 
                      as supposedly more 'global' ones.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite 
                      this criticism, <i>Green Economics</i> offers important 
                      ideas for anybody seeking a way beyond our current economic 
                      impasse which will put the interests of the bulk of humanity 
                      and the natural world ahead of those of a cabal of wealthy 
                      individuals and corporations. As Cato so clearly demonstrates, 
                      green economics is an emerging field within which there 
                      remains room for considerable discussion and debate, and 
                      it is high time that it came to be taken more seriously.

                        captured the ears and minds of politicians. The central 
                        plank of their 'neo-liberal' model was that growth and 
                        development depended on market competitiveness; everything 
                        should be done to maximise competition and competitiveness, 
                        and to allow market principles to permeate all aspects

                        risks and insecurity onto workers and their families. 
                        The result has been the creation of a global 'precariat', 
                        consisting of many millions around the world without an 
                        anchor of stability. They are becoming a new dangerous

                      pre-1980s 'industrial citizenship', and compares them to 
                      the insecurities experienced by the precariat: a new pattern 
                      of existence which has now infected most occupational groups. 
                      For all of them, 'labour is instrumental (to live), opportunistic 
                      (taking what comes) and precarious (insecure)' (p.14). Anxiety, 
                      alienation, and information overload, are some of the results.</font></p>

                      discusses the reasons for the precariat's growth: a global 
                      labour market, the weakening of social and trade union labour 
                      market protections, individual and temporary contracts replacing 
                      regulated permanent ones, and unemployment benefits becoming 
                      more precarious so that they don't look more attractive 
                      than precarious employment. When he asks 'Who enters the 
                      precariat?' he finds that it can be any of us, from interns 
                      to post-retirement age employees who, subsidized by small 
                      pensions, deprive younger people of the employment they 
                      need. Particularly welcome to mobile capital is ultra-precarious 
                      migrant labour. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      24/7 global market is changing our sense of time, and also 
                      our understanding of 'work', which is now not only 'labour', 
                      i.e., 'work having exchange value' (p.117), but 'work for 
                      labour' (p.120), i.e., job-search and personal financial 
                      management. Also now very different is our politics. A surveillance 
                      society, an anxious precariat, and the collapse of political 
                      engagement, have given us a commodified politics, with competitive 
                      political parties advertising their wares to disengaged 
                      voters. Successful promotion can turn the previous fringe

                      in this situation, can we provide the sense of security 
                      necessary for constructive functioning in flexible labour 
                      markets and in a chaotic social environment? Standing's 
                      well-argued response is 'universal provision'. As he has 
                      shown in his second chapter, the recommodification of labour 
                      (a shift from the reward for labour being diverse social 
                      benefits to being entirely and simultaneously monetary) 
                      is an inevitable result of temporary contracts (p.41). This 
                      results in a loss of employment benefits: a particular problem 
                      where healthcare is employment-based. The UK, with its healthcare 
                      free at the point of use, is able to weather the change 
                      to precarious labour contracts better than many other countries. 
                      Standing could with profit have used this example to bolster 
                      his already persuasive argument for a Citizen's Income (pp.171-3).

                      situation, because, if we don't, then its members will be 
                      sucked even further into the orbit of extremist right wing 
                      parties, where at least they find an outlet for their anger. 
                      As he recognises, anxiety and freedom go together, and a 
                      more precarious lifestyle is not necessarily worse than 
                      one founded on a secure full-time job, and might offer possibilities 
                      which that didn't. What we need is the basic securities 
                      which will make precarious living a positive experience.</font></p>

                      so the context within which the Conservative Party in opposition

                      the welfare state at any particular point in time has tended 
                      to be linked to fine calculations as to whether it was operating

                      considerable continuity. They point out that ministers in 
                      the Coalition Government's Department of Work and Pensions 
                      (DWP), Iain Duncan Smith, Chris Grayling, and Steve Webb,

                      the insights of a religious faith to bear on their interest 
                      in benefits policy. We have seen changes to housing benefit 
                      which will not relieve poverty, however much one might understand 
                      the need to reduce employment disincentives; and we have 
                      seen changes to uprating policy which will erode the value 
                      of benefits: but we have also seen Iain Duncan Smith's proposal 
                      for a Universal Credit to replace existing in work and out 
                      of work means-tested benefits in such a way as to reduce 
                      marginal deduction rates, and we have now seen Steve Webb's 
                      proposals for a Citizen's Pension: an initiative which came 
                      after this book was published. The relevant chapter's verdict 
                      that 'there appears little different in policy between New 
                      Labour and the Coalition' (p.157) in pensions policy is 
                      no longer true; and Webb's proposals also cast doubt on 
                      the authors' view that there is 'a general distrust of universalist 
                      policies' (p.159). A particular political context at a national 
                      party conference gave rise to the impractical suggestion 
                      that households containing high earners should be deprived 
                      of their Child Benefit, and there is in fact no sign of 
                      a thought-through policy on universal benefits. The fact 
                      that a coalition government is bound to be more pragmatic 
                      than a government formed by a single party, and the fact 
                      that the Liberal Democrats are the Conservatives' partner 
                      in government, suggests that we shall increasingly see policy 
                      evaluated in relation to whether it will solve identifiable 
                      problems rather than in relation to ideological positions: 
                      hence a Citizen's Pension to remove disincentives to save 
                      for old age. </font></p>

                      two or three years' time it will be interesting to look 
                      again at this book's chapters on different policy areas 
                      and ask whether the trajectories suggested have proved to 
                      be the directions in which policy has gone, and in particular 
                      to see whether the pragmatic or the ideological has taken 
                      centre stage, or whether they have achieved a pragmatic 
                      balance. It will be particularly interesting to see whether 
                      the pragmatism of coalition has retained Child Benefit as 
                      a universal benefit, has seen a Citizen's Pension enacted, 
                      and has prompted work on an unconditional benefit for working 
                      age adults. </font></p>

                      that today's appropriate tasks are research on minimum income

                      for all children in the UK. We can no longer be complacent 
                      about the very different life chances that children experience 
                      in our society; and we must, of course, campaign for Child 
                      Benefit to remain universal (p.124). This theme is taken 
                      up in Carol Walker's chapter, 'for universalism and against 
                      the means test' (p.133), which offers a comprehensive history 
                      of means-tested benefits since 1942, discusses their social 
                      consequences, sees them as an instrument of social control, 
                      and lists some of their disadvantages: lack of take-up, 
                      high marginal deduction rates, etc.. Townsend argued that 
                      universal benefits are 'an efficient, economical and socially 
                      integrative mechanism' to prevent poverty which 'have as

                      (p.3), and Gary Berg's study - strong on both quantitative 
                      and qualitative data - shows why. The school system doesn't 
                      provide sufficient support for those students whose home 
                      backgrounds have disadvantaged their learning and diminished 
                      their ambitions; universities' admissions policies favour 
                      the already advantaged, partly because only the wealthy 
                      plan the sports which can give students an admissions advantage, 
                      especially at elite universities; because financial aid 
                      policies are inadequate; and because members of low income 
                      groups are more likely to drop out of college because there 
                      isn't adequate support in relation to problems which they 
                      might be carrying with them, particularly fragile self-esteem. 
                      A chapter which finds that gender and race interlock with 
                      low income to create compound disadvantage, and that the 
                      rolling back of positive discrimination policies, at the 
                      same time as universities have sought wealthy international 
                      students in order to appear diverse, is taking the country 
                      even further from inclusivity. A case study of a student 
                      summer school rams home the point. A chapter on the public 
                      image of universities shows that the public no longer expects 
                      them to offer social mobility in the way in which it used 
                      to be hoped that they would; and the final substantial chapter 
                      demonstrates that a degree has less impact on lifetime earnings 
                      for a poor student than for a wealthy one, and suggests 
                      that the causal link isn't between family income and future 
                      success but is rather between parental characteristics and 
                      both quality parenting and income, both of which then have 
                      consequences for the would be student. A final chapter reiterates 
                      the chapters' conclusions and suggests that higher education 
                      needs to be redesigned for low income students, that universities 
                      need to serve their students rather than achieve prestige, 
                      and that the United States needs to become a more equal 
                      society: 'America is far to comfortably unequal' (p.164). 
                      A major reason for this inequality is the tax system, in 
                      which substantial mortgage cost tax allowances advantage 
                      the already wealth and don't benefit the poor.</font></p>

                      passionate and well-researched study show just how many

                      admission and their ability to benefit from higher education. 
                      Their own and their family's incomes are just two of those 
                      factors, but these are two factors that a government can 
                      do something about. The UK's new higher education funding 
                      regime is going to provide us with more of the difficulties 
                      outlined in this book. Again, families' and students' incomes 
                      are partly functions of government policy. The only conclusion 
                      to draw is that the funding of higher education and family 
                      income maintenance are policy areas that need to be integrated 
                      with each other far more than they are at the moment.</font></p>

                      symposium in Barcelona which gave birth to this edited collection 
                      belongs to a European research project on gender and well-being 
                      charged with developing a new concept of well-being and 
                      new social indicators which will reflect the different circumstances 
                      of male and female lives. This will in turn provide a gendered 
                      framework for the evaluation of social policies. The Barcelona 
                      symposium was particularly concerned with the production 
                      and distribution of well-being within the family: a family 
                      which can no longer be regarded as an 'undifferentiated 
                      economic unit' (p.xix), suggesting that an important question 
                      is the extent to which largely female work within the family 
                      compares to largely male work outside it in relation to 
                      their contributions to well-being within the family. </font></p>

                      introductory chapter is followed by a discussion of Amartya 
                      Sen's 'capability approach': well-being understood as the 
                      opportunities open to us. Ingrid Robeyne's verdict is that 
                      this approach needs to be supplemented by research on the 
                      extent to which decisions within the family are a matter 
                      of free choice and the extent to which they are conditioned 
                      by cultural norms which encourage unjust decisions within 
                      the family.</font></p>

                      3 offers a history of the British family which shows that

                      a fragility and form that with minor shadings has been common 
                      for working-class families through the industrial era' (p.57). 
                      The fourth chapter combines production and reproduction 
                      into a single complex system, notes that higher numbers 
                      of women in employment has become the means of maintaining 
                      families' economic viability during a period of 'wage containment' 
                      (p.74), and finds that in this context adequate public services

                      1850 to 1930; differential access to education in Switzerland 
                      between 1880 and 1930; celibacy and gender inequalities 
                      in the Pyrenees since the nineteenth century; the relationship 
                      between Italian family members' life plans and the ways

                      emerges is the complexity of relationships within the family, 
                      of the ways in which resources are distributed, and of the 
                      ways in which different kinds of work are allocated. Whilst 
                      it is still possible to generalise that care work within 
                      the family is still mainly undertaken by women and that 
                      material resources from outside the home are still generated 
                      mainly by men, there are complexities within that generalisation, 
                      and there is much evidence that doesn't fit into it. Diversity 
                      is now the reality: between countries, between families, 
                      and within families. </font></p>

                      isn't clear from this well-researched and most interesting 
                      book is how the research findings might influence the direction 
                      of social policy. One obvious conclusion to draw is that 
                      in a situation of such diversity, policy should be neutral 
                      in relation to how a family organises its relationships, 
                      its employment patterns, and its care work. Many of our 
                      current tax and benefits provisions are not neutral in this 
                      way. Individualised universal benefits, of course, would 
                      be. <br>

                      is CEO of a major producer, brought home to me the urgency 
                      of establishing a Citizen's Income and lower marginal wage 
                      rates in the developed western countries. Factory labour 
                      in Shanghai is paid around 500 yuan per week - about &pound;50. 
                      Looking forward say three years the figure is likely to

                      term, companies will need to experience very similar marginal 
                      labour costs in different countries. Manufacturing can take 
                      place in many locations and no country will be able to enjoy 
                      a sustained advantage due to knowledge or skills that is 
                      large enough to maintain high employment. There is probably 
                      little support now for the idea that the insurance, banking 
                      and retail sectors can together provide enough in the UK 
                      for us not to worry about manufacturing. Insurance and banking 
                      are easily copied, while good retailing mostly creates jobs 
                      in the country where the outlets are situated. The only 
                      sectors likely to persist as edges for the UK for many years 
                      are expensive legal services, educational services and global 
                      expert institutes. Germany has good international competitiveness 
                      currently based on quality and efficiency. But it will not 
                      be sustainable long term over China. In the short term, 
                      getting quality to an adequate level is a major challenge 
                      for China. But equally, it needs to be recognised that there 
                      are already exceptions, such as Solar cells production. 
                      Of course, long term equilibrium is rarely reached, but 
                      given differences in key economic measures between China 
                      and the West, it is clear that more needs to be done to 
                      increase global competitiveness. And in practice change 
                      can only be made progressively, so a figure of &pound;60 
                      per week as a Citizen's Income is a great start, but much 
                      more will be needed to sustain competitiveness long term.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
                      sound long term expectation is for working individuals to 
                      receive a Citizen's Income plus a globally competitive pay 
                      level, the latter element varying by skill level. The level 
                      of the Citizen's Income should mainly reflect the cumulative 
                      wealth of the country, though some income redistribution 
                      could also take place. By contrast, if countries choose 
                      to use their cumulative wealth to support high marginal 
                      wage rates and simply exhort their citizens to be innovative, 
                      that is a recipe for unemployment and a trade deficit. And 
                      it will get much worse as China develops and improves quality.

                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
                      tax/benefit system need not really balance to current revenue 
                      levels - a progressive increase in VAT (together with energy 
                      consumption taxes) would anyway be beneficial. A move to 
                      a Citizen's Income will reduce company costs and mitigate 
                      inflationary pressures from an increase in VAT. The same 
                      general arguments about competitiveness mean that the income 
                      tax threshold should be increased significantly.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
                      return to the figures, if reasonable income for a low skilled 
                      manufacturing worker in a developed country is &pound;300 
                      per week, then a more efficient (and fairer) economy would 
                      develop from a Citizen's Income of &pound;200 per week plus 
                      a manufacturing wage of &pound;100 per week. That latter 
                      figure is close enough to the Chinese equivalent of &pound;75 
                      estimated above. For now, the European economies will still 
                      have skill and quality advantages that can offset some labour 
                      premium. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 
                      will argue that this balance would discourage work in the 
                      UK. I think that this is a small risk. In their hearts most 
                      people understand the importance of work and will make decisions 
                      at the margin. Moreover, there is enormous scope for an 
                      expansion in the work force (including part-time) from the 
                      over 60's, the under 18's, housewives and people with disabilities. 
                      The social and emotional benefits of working are well understood. 
                      In any event, implementation - though urgent - would have 
                      to be progressive and &pound;60 per week is a good start. 
                      But it is important that the minimum wage is reduced as 
                      the Citizen's Income is provided and increased. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alternatively, 
                      a Citizen's Income of &pound;150 per week plus a wage of 
                      &pound;100 is a balance, because of household structure 
                      - in that approximately 50% of women of working age are 
                      carers - but this is a theoretical debate at this stage. 
                      The effect on the economy of establishing a Citizen's Income 
                      and reducing minimum wages, will be so dramatically good 
                      as to easily support a progressive increase in Citizen's 
                      Income while maintaining a prudent fiscal policy. The figure 
                      of around &pound;200 per week is also supported by the current 
                      old age pension level and would sweep away the debate on 
                      retirement age. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
                      effect of a Citizen's Income and a reduced minimum wage 
                      would be immediate cancellation of some unnecessary automation 
                      projects, which typically involve expensive imported machines. 
                      Some other savings will also be readily available - maybe 
                      coal mining would become viable again. And at the margin, 
                      a much lower wage rate would make employing a few more staff 
                      in many areas in a company sensible.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
                      current levels of global communication and popular understanding, 
                      a Citizen's Income and lower marginal wages is the only 
                      economically sound way of avoiding increasing unrest in 
                      Europe. There is some chance that people will put up with 
                      the alternative of years of austerity, but not a high one. 
                      The situation in the United States is possibly even more 
                      serious. Even though many will theoretically agree with 
                      the strength of the arguments in favour of a Citizen's Income, 
                      getting significant change achieved in the USA is notoriously 
                      slow and difficult. </font></p>
